So last month, when Fox started rolling out publicity for the third season, chatter grew on television Web sites about the fate of Dr. Sara Tancredi, the character played by Sarah Wayne Callies (above, in character), who is missing from the group photos of the cast being distributed by the network. Dr. Tancredi, a former addict, is the prison physician who helped the show's protagonists, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), and his brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), escape in the first season and stay on the lam in the second. (Stop reading here if you do not want to know her fate.) Ms. Callies revealed she was pregnant at the end of last season, with the baby due in August. The third season of ''Prison Break'' was to start shooting by then, so the producers used a body double for her in the first few episodes. Todd Adair, a Fox spokesman, explained that a double was used because the timeline progressed only a couple of months over the first two seasons and there was no way to incorporate Ms. Callies's pregnancy into the story line.
