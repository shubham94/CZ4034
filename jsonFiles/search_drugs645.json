The issue surfaced in the early 1990's, when the drugs -- Prozac and Zoloft the most common among them -- first hit the market, and was soon dismissed. But recent studies have reignited concern. The labeling change is intended to make doctors more cautious about prescribing the drugs and patients more cautious about taking them. Such vigilance is crucial. But if the labeling scares depressed people away from medications that would help them, it is also dangerous. It is probably the case that antidepressants both cause and prevent deaths. But it is also clearly the case that they prevent more deaths than they cause. The danger is that in seeking to prevent antidepressant-related suicide, we will increase depression-related suicide.", "headline": {"main": "A Bitter Pill"}, "abstract": "Op-Ed article by Andrew Solomon says that Food and Drug Adm, under mounting pressure, announced changes in labeling of 10 antidepressants to reflect apprehension that they may increase suicidal feelings, especially among children and adolescents in first weeks of treatment; fears that labeling change may scare some depressed people away from needed medications; says antidepressants probably prevent more deaths than they cause, suggesting that in seeking to prevent antidepressant-related suicide, there will be increase in depression-related suicide; says it is important to conduct studies that identify mechanisms of antidepressant-related suicide, and to seek patterns that may predict it; drawing (M)", "print_page": "21", "word_count": 1040, "_id": "4fd2391a8eb7c8105d7cce53", "snippet": "Under mounting pressure, the Food and Drug Administration last week announced changes in the labeling of 10 antidepressants to reflect apprehension that they may increase suicidal feelings, especially among children and adolescents, especially in the...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/29/opinion/a-bitter-pill.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LABELING AND LABELS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MENTAL HEALTH AND DISORDERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ANTIDEPRESSANTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CONSUMER PROTECTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEPRESSION (MENTAL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SUICIDES AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Andrew", "lastname": "Solomon"}], "original": "By Andrew Solomon"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2004-03-29T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Opinion"}], "meta": {"hits": 2, "offset": 0, "time": 25}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
