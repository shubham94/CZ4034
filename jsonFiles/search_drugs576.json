Powell arrived in Bangkok accompanied by Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida on a journey intended to assure the devastated region of American support. A1 President Bush enlisted his father, former President George H.W. Bush, and former President Bill Clinton to lead an effort to raise money from individuals, corporations and foundations in the United States for disaster relief. A9 One extraordinary facet of the response to the disaster has been the cooperation between the two sides in Sri Lanka's brutal civil war. The government and rebels have been working together to deliver aid, and large numbers of Sri Lankans appear to be spontaneously reaching across the country's festering ethnic divides to deliver donated food. A1 In 30 sorties, helicopters from the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln flew down the Indonesian coast to more than half a dozen towns, delivering water, food, medical personnel and supplies and picking up wounded victims, American military officials said. A14 The Bush administration said it would pay for its $350 million pledge of tsunami disaster relief from money already in this year's budget, rejecting the idea of asking Congress to approve immediate emergency funds to cover the costs. A10 Rethinking Training of Iraqis Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top commander in Iraq, is reviewing a proposal to add hundreds of American military advisers to work directly with Iraqi units, whose disappointing performance could jeopardize the long-term American exit strategy from Iraq, senior military officials said. A1 Hours after a wave of bombing attacks in Iraq that left at least 20 people dead, Prime Minister Ayad Allawi called President Bush and discussed the many impediments still facing the country as it heads toward elections in 27 days, according to senior American officials. The officials insisted that Mr. Allawi did not tell Mr. Bush that the elections should be delayed. A8 Putin Demotes Critical Advisor President Vladimir V. Putin abruptly reduced the responsibilities of a senior adviser who last week issued a sweeping criticism of the Kremlin's leadership and expressed deep misgivings about the direction in which Russia was headed. A8 Terror Trial Begins in France The trial of six men suspected of plotting to bomb the American Embassy in Paris in 2001 opened with tense exchanges between the chief judge and the suspected ringleader. A8 New Protests from Settlers Jewish settlers began a new round of protests and warned that large numbers of Israeli soldiers could refuse to carry out orders to remove settlers from the Gaza Strip later this year. A3 NATIONAL A12-17 Supreme Court Evaluates Juvenile Death Penalty In August, Robert Acuna, a high school student from Baytown, Tex., became the latest person to enter death row for a crime committed before the age of 18. If the Supreme Court prohibits the execution of 16- and 17-year-olds in a case it accepted a year ago, the lives of Mr. Acuna and 71 other juvenile offenders on death row will be spared. A1 Congress Keeps Ethics Rules Stung by criticism that they were lowering ethical standards, House Republicans decided to reverse a rule change that would have allowed a party leader to retain his position if indicted. A1 California Bans .50-Caliber Gun California became the first state in the nation to ban the .50-caliber long-range rifle, a firearm that gun control advocates have portrayed as a military weapon that could fall into the hands of terrorists. A12 146 Drugs In Medicare Plan A federal advisory panel, working closely with the Bush administration, announced a list of 146 types of prescription drugs that should be covered under Medicare's new drug benefit. A12 Snow in Southern California Heavy clouds clamped down over Los Angeles and much of Southern California, dropping more precipitation on a region already choked with snow and soaked from almost a week of intermittent downpours. A12 5 Indicted in Maryland Fires A federal grand jury indicted five young men in connection with firesthat caused $10 million damage last month to an upscale new subdivision in southern Maryland. A13 St. Louis Orchestra Dispute The stage of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra was empty because of a labor dispute, and 33 horn and double-bass players who have been showing up this week for scheduled auditions were left without work. A13 Idaho Wolf Rules Slackened The gray wolves in Idaho are still formally protected by the federal Endangered Species Act, but starting in 30 days they can be killed if a landowner believes a wolf is in the process of attacking livestock or other animals. A17 ARTS E1-14 Building Begins on Colossal Art Work began on ''The Gates,'' a massive artwork by Christo and Jeanne-Claude being installed in Central Park. The $20 million project will be the largest public art project in New York since the Park itself was designed in 1857. E1 Arts Project Provokes Uproar Plans by the Hong Kong government to build a cultural complex several times the size of Lincoln Center have become the center of a bitter debate among local artists and international cultural institutions. E1 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 City's New Theme Schools Get Mixed Reviews When New York City opened dozens of new small high schools this school year, it hoped that giving them themes like architecture and hospitality management would attract students. But four months into the school year, some themes are working better than others. A1 U.S. Wraps Up Stewart Case A federal prosecutor wrapped up the government's case against Lynne F. Stewart, a lawyer accused of aiding terrorists, by charging that she had released a bellicose statement on behalf of an imprisoned client because she secretly wanted to help violent militants overthrow the Egyptian government. B4 A Politician's Private Role James E.

The shoulder disappears, the grass is left uncut and the black-eyed Susans and big pink Texas sage have to compete with the orange traffic cones set out by the border patrol. Just two counties up from the Texas tip, where the flood plains along the Rio Grande change to rolling hills and eroding cliffs, Starr County, largely Mexican-American, is one of the poorest counties in the nation. Fifty-nine percent of its children live below the poverty level, and in the strange new arithmetic of want, in which poverty means not starvation but its opposite, it is also one of the fattest. In the colonias on the edge of Rio Grande City -- jerry-rigged neighborhoods that are home to many illegal immigrants and lack adequate municipal services -- houses that look as if they might fall down neighbor houses that look like fortresses, a result of the boom-and-bust drug economy. Little gorditos run around in juice-stained diapers, and as the kids get older, they only get fatter. By the time they are 4 years old, 24 percent of the children are overweight or obese; by kindergarten, 28 percent; and by elementary school, 50 percent of the boys are overweight or obese, along with 35 percent of the girls. The concern is not just cosmetic. Overweight children are at significantly greater risk for developing Type 2 diabetes, and by early adulthood, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, colon cancer, breast cancer, gallbladder disease, arthritis and sleep apnea. ''Stop by any time,'' said the local school district superintendent, Roel Gonzalez, inviting me to visit. The child of migrant farm workers, Gonzalez is perhaps the children's greatest advocate and the community's greatest critic. ''I will take you down the hall in any one of my schools, and you will see most of the children aren't slim anymore; they're all beefy.
