The five-year contract that the company tentatively agreed to Aug. 7 with union employees covered by the Communications Workers of America includes changes in the medical benefits for retirees. The cap for medical expenses for retirees has been increased to $6,982 a year from $5,000 a year, a company spokesman, Jeff Battcher, said. BellSouth has always waived the cap in the past and will do so again. This time, however, the company has decided to calculate what its expected overage will be for retiree medical benefits. The change in the calculation will result in an increase in the retiree medical benefit obligation of approximately $3.3 billion, which will be recognized over the average remaining service life of employees. BellSouth expects to spend 10 percent more this year on medical benefits for its active employees and retirees, Mr. Battcher said.
