Also like most of the country's colleges and universities, it is not particularly selective. Arizona admits 83 percent of its applicants, although most graduated in the top half of their high school class. They sit in numbing lecture halls with 500 classmates; the only instructor they may know is a teaching assistant, and they are, for all intents and purposes, anonymous. This is not exactly the popular image of ivy-covered higher education, but it's the truth of it. Most students do not go to an Amherst or a Williams. They go to enormous public institutions like the Universities of Arizona, Iowa, Connecticut, Minnesota: more than five million undergraduates attend an institution with at least 15,000 students. The freshman class alone exceeds the population of a small town, and the course catalog is the size of a phone book.

As a show of faith, it's a tough act to follow. But that has not stopped some ingenious American hucksters from trying. Tonight is the much-awaited ''Justice Sunday,'' the judge-bashing rally being disseminated nationwide by cable, satellite and Internet from a megachurch in Louisville. It may not boast a plume of smoke emerging from above the Sistine Chapel, but it will feature its share of smoke and mirrors as well as traditions that, while not dating back a couple of millenniums, do at least recall the 1920's immortalized in ''Elmer Gantry.'' These traditions have less to do with the earnest practice of religion by an actual church, as we witnessed from Rome, than with the exploitation of religion by political operatives and other cynics with worldly ends. While Sinclair Lewis wrote that Gantry, his hypocritical evangelical preacher, ''was born to be a senator,'' we now have senators who are born to be Gantrys. One of them, the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, hatched plans to be beamed into tonight's festivities by videotape, a stunt that in itself imbues ''Justice Sunday'' with a touch of all-American spectacle worthy of ''The Wizard of Oz.''", "headline": {"main": "A High-Tech Lynching in Prime Time", "kicker": "Op-Ed Columnist"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "13", "word_count": 1505, "_id": "4fd25af38eb7c8105d807e96", "snippet": "Tonight's \"Justice Sunday,\" the judge-bashing rally being disseminated nationwide by cable, satellite and Internet, has a gay agenda.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/opinion/24rich.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2005/04/07/opinion/rich-new.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/04/07/opinion/rich-new.75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55, "height": 55}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "WALLACE, GEORGE JR"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DELAY, TOM"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FRIST, BILL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COURTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHRISTIANS AND CHRISTIANITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOMOSEXUALITY"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Frank", "rank": 1, "lastname": "RICH"}], "original": "By FRANK RICH"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-04-24T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Review", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Book Review Desk", "lead_paragraph": "In Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book (Basic Books, $26), his history of the early comic book industry, Gerard Jones recounts for the zillionth time how Batman became Batman: a young son of fortune sees his parents gunned down in Gotham's police-absent streets; years later, after he declares a war on crime, a bat gets trapped in his house, inspiring a new wardrobe. And yet as familiar as it is, Jones says, something undeniably new and powerful occurred when the ''Batman'' writer, Bill Finger, wrote this story in 1939. Earlier comics, Jones writes, seemed to be ''content with the idea that a man would devote his life to fighting crime simply because his father had told him to or because he was so inherently good. Bill Finger was the first to bring a novelist's questions to bear on a superhero. Why would a man choose such a life?
