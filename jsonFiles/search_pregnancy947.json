This film, narrated by Alfre Woodard, begins with Parks's early childhood in Kansas and follows him through a truly remarkable life and career. 6 P.M. TO MIDNIGHT (Discovery Health) BIRTH DAY LIVE -- This annual reality-programming event aims for new heights of intrusiveness by posing lame questions to women in agonizing labor pain, doctors busy guiding infants down the birth canal and panicked husbands obligated to be in the delivery room. (''Has your wife been enjoying this second pregnancy?'' a perky reporter asked in last year's edition.) This year's show comes live from hospitals in San Diego; Baton Rouge, La.; and Silver Spring, Md. This may be educational television, but it seems a shame when the doctors hold the newborns up for the cameras before they show them to the mothers, who have done all that hard work. 8 P.M. (CBS) NCIS -- A teenage boy attaches a bomb to his body and holds his fellow high school students hostage. The question is whether this was his idea. 8 P.M. (5) AMERICAN IDOL -- Week 9. The 12 finalists perform. 9 P.M. (ABC) SONS & DAUGHTERS -- In the evening's first episode, young Henry (Trevor Einhorn, left) tries to talk his family out of attending his school film festival. For good reason. Then, at 9:30, a big family barbecue turns into something of a group therapy session. 10 P.M. (ABC) BOSTON LEGAL -- Recently, Brad Chase (Mark Valley) helped out his colleague Paul Lewiston (Rene Auberjonois) by spying on his daughter (Jayne Brook), who claims to have kicked her meth habit. Now Paul asks for more of Brad's help. Meanwhile, as if Alan Shore (James Spader) doesn't have enough problems, his secretary (Marisa Coughlan) is arrested for tax evasion. 10 P.M. (FX) THE SHIELD -- ''Of Mice and Lem.'' Vic (Michael Chiklis) may be a corrupt cop, but he tries to take care of his people. Concerned about Lem (Kenneth Johnson) being safe in prison, he makes a deal with the Devil, so to speak, to protect him. 10 P.M. (USA) NASHVILLE STAR -- Season premiere. As the title pretty much spells out, this is a show in which would be country music singers compete. Wynonna Judd (right) and Cowboy Troy are the hosts.
