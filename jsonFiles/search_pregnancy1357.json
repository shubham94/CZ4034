In his ode to statesmanship, 17th Century Thomas Dekker must have had Governor Wilson in mind: ''The best of men that ever wore earth about him was a sufferer, a soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil spirit. The first gentleman that ever breathed!''. He lent legitimacy to government and elegance to the governed. In an era when the young were trampled underfoot in society's indifference, Malcolm Wilson stood so very tall in his dynamic concern for the troubled families and legions of the young who landed on the doorstep of Daytop Village. A huge part of his life is written in the grateful prayers of the rescued. His were the words of 12th Century St. Bernard: ''Prayer is a wine which makes glad the heart of man!''. May he rest with God! (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien, President Daytop Village, Inc. WILSON-Hon. Malcolm. Fordham University and the Board of Trustees mourn the loss of our colleague and loyal friend, Malcolm Wilson.

His Board service continued until he took the oath of office of the Governor and again later as Trustee Emeritus until his recent death. His concern and commitment to Fordham University as a Trustee and in many other roles will always be remembered. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughters and their families. Paul B. Gunther Chair of the Board Joseph A. O'Hare, S.J. President WILSON-Hon. Malcolm.
