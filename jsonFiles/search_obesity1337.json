This cluster of cells, called the locus coeruleus because of its blue tint, seems to be a key place where anxiety and fear take shape and where the painful sensations of withdrawal from narcotic drugs may have at least part of their origins. The locus has become a target of much scientific study because its activity offers clues to parts of the immense puzzle of the chemistry of the brain and the derangements of that chemistry caused by drugs. In recent years scientists have made giant strides in identifying a whole host of chemicals through which the brain acts in health and disease, in normality and in such aberrations as drug addiction. The focus of scientific attention is now on efforts to understand just how that multitude of different chemicals and nerve circuits actually do the brain's work - that most complex of biochemical performances in the panoply of life on earth.", "snippet": "THERE is a minute blue spot in the human brain, a cluster of only several thousand cells, that has profound effects on the billions of other brain cells around and above it.
