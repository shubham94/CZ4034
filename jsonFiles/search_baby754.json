He was a swaggering, beefy, profane man in a secondhand U.S. Marines shirt, and he was explaining to the television cameras why Serbs could never be secure until non-Serbs were removed from what he considered Serb territory. It was August 1992 in Prijedor, a city in northwest Bosnia and Herzegovina. A small group of reporters wanted permission to enter Omarska, a concentration camp not far from Prijedor. Omarska was the most notorious camp of the Bosnian war. Reports had already emerged that the guards there did not merely kill Muslim and Croat inmates but beat and tortured them to death with singular sadism and personal brutality. Kovacevic told the reporters they could visit Omarska but said that they would find ''not concentration camps but transit centers,'' and that what they were witnessing was ''a great moment in the history of the Serbian nation.'' Three years later, on a Radio Prijedor program commemorating that great moment, he boasted, ''I'm not afraid of any of those 21 cells in The Hague.'' There are actually 24 cells in the jail to hold the accused at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague. Since July of last year, one has been occupied by Milan Kovacevic. When he goes on trial on May 11, he will be the first man brought to justice at The Hague on charges of genocide, a crime considered the most heinous in human history, and one that is likely to carry the maximum penalty the tribunal can dispense, a life sentence. Kovacevic is depressed and suicidal according to a psychiatrist who interviewed him. He has developed heart problems and has had two, possibly three, strokes. When I saw him recently, in a courtroom at The Hague during a hearing on his case, it was hard to believe he was 56. He looked 70.", "headline": {"main": "Defending The Indefensible"}, "abstract": "Tina Rosenberg article on plans for international tribunal in Hauge to try Bosnian Serb Dr Milan Kovacevic on genocide charges for his role in setting up concentration camps; tribunal, set up by United Nations Security Council in 1993, has become serious and even feared force for justice in Bosnia since last summer, when NATO and UN troops began arresting accused criminals; Kovacevic's lawyer, Dusan Vucicevic, Serb emigre to United States, plans to argue that Serbs of Prijedor were provoked by Muslim threats, reigning myth among many Serbs; his co-counsel, Anthony D'Amato opposes strategy; photos (L)", "print_page": "46", "word_count": 7788, "_id": "4fd1deaa8eb7c8105d722cc7", "snippet": "The last time the world got a glimpse of Milan Kovacevic, he was guarding the portals of hell.
