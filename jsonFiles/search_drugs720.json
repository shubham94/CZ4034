Children began shouting the word ngumbi, announcing that winged termites were fluttering through the fields. These were not the bigger species of the insect, which can be fried in oil and sold as a delicacy for a good price. Instead, these were the smaller ones, far more wing than torso, which are eaten right away. Suddenly, most everyone was giddily chasing about; villagers were catching ngumbi with their fingers and tossing them onto their tongues, grateful for the unexpected gift of food afloat in the air. Adilesi Faisoni was able to share in that happiness but not in the cavorting. For several years, old age had been catching up with her, until it had finally pulled even and then ahead. Her walk was unsteady now, her posture stooped, her eyesight dimmed. As the others ran about, she remained seated on the wet ground near the doorstep of her mud-brick hovel. It was the same place I always found her during my weeks in the villages of Malawi, weeks when I was examining the mechanisms of famine. ''There is no way to get used to hunger,'' Adilesi told me once. ''All the time something is moving in your stomach. You feel the emptiness. You feel your intestines moving. They are too empty, and they are searching for something to fill up on.''", "headline": {"main": "Why People Still Starve"}, "abstract": "Barry Bearak article on causes of widespread, chronic and intractable hunger in sub-Saharan Africa, where most nations grow poorer, sicker and hungrier each year; focuses on mechanisms of famine in Malawi village; notes even small jolts to regular food supply can spur shift from normal, chronic malnutrition to outright starvation; hunger and disease then feed off each other, leaving invisible poor to die in invisible numbers; photos (L)", "print_page": "33", "word_count": 7683, "_id": "4fd274108eb7c8105d831f79", "snippet": "Late one afternoon, during the long melancholia of the hungry months, there was a burst of joyous delirium in Mkulumimba.
