The teenager had hidden the pregnancy from her family until she gave birth on Sept. 4, investigators said. Early that morning, they said, her stepmother found her stumbling about the family's apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant. At first the girl refused to admit that she had just given birth, officials said, but finally, after coaxing from her stepmother and an uncle, she took them to her room, where she had left the baby wrapped in a towel, the police said. The baby was not breathing, so a city ambulance was called to the apartment, in a four-story brownstone on Kent Avenue, and he was rushed to Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, where he was pronounced dead. Four days later, the medical examiner's office conducted and autopsy and determined that the baby had died from ''asphyxia by smothering,'' officials said. The girl, who suffered from complications associated with the birth, was kept in the hospital for medical care until yesterday, when she was charged and released into the custody of her father and stepmother. Although the baby's death had been ruled a homicide several weeks ago, officials said it had taken time to fully investigate the case and determine the appropriate charge. The teenager, who was not identified by the police because of her age, is not charged with intentionally killing the child. The charge of criminally negligent homicide indicates that investigators determined that the girl had failed to perceive the substantial risk that a reasonable person under the same circumstances would have perceived: that the baby could be killed by being wrapped so completely in a towel. The case will be handled through Family Court, which handles the cases of juvenile offenders. Peter Reinharz, chief of the Family Law Division in the City Law Department, said that in the last five years, there had been a handful of other cases in which very young mothers had been charged with criminally negligent homicide in the death of newborns. A neighbor, Areli Martinez, said yesterday that the girl had been scared to admit her pregnancy and had tried to conceal it from her family and friends. Ms. Martinez said she had not noticed anything because the teenager is big for her age and the pregnancy did not show. ''She was scared,'' she said. ''When she delivered, she delivered alone. It's terrible.'' Investigators said the girl had identified a schoolmate as the father of the child, but it is unclear what school the girl attends. Although police officials said they believed the girl attended Public School 157, officials there said the girl graduated last year. After being admitted to the hospital, the teenager was temporarily put in the custody of the Administration for Children's Services, officials said. She was released to her family yesterday after child welfare investigators found no signs of neglect in the home, said Jennifer Falk, a spokeswoman for the agency.", "headline": {"main": "Police Charge 13-Year-Old In Death of Newborn Son"}, "abstract": "Thirteen-year-old girl who had given birth by herself is charged with criminally negligent homicide after autopsy revealed newborn son had suffocated; incident took place in Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn; case will be heard in Family Court (M)", "print_page": "3", "word_count": 512, "_id": "4fd21a208eb7c8105d798700", "snippet": "A 13-year-old girl who had given birth by herself in her Brooklyn bedroom was charged with criminally negligent homicide yesterday after an autopsy revealed her newborn son had suffocated, police officials said.
