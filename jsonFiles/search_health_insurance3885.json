But President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, viewed as the most responsible figure to face the looming crisis, remains far ahead in opinion polls. 3 Yeltsin Role Seems to Fade As Russia's new Prime Minister struggled to patch together a coalition Cabinet last week, Boris N. Yeltsin seemed to remain largely in the background, adding to the growing impression that the once-powerful President has been left with a largely ceremonial role. 26 Swedes Go to the Polls Swedes go to the polls today to choose the 349 members of their parliament, and a multitude of municipal officials. The results will determine whether Prime Minister Goran Persson will remain in office or if Carl Bildt returns to the post, which he held from 1991 to 1994. 13 104 Still Missing in Philippines One hundred four people remained missing and 23 were confirmed dead after the sinking of a ferry early yesterday in the mouth of Manila Bay, in the Philippines.

Lewinsky, lawyers familiar with the proceeding said. That image is starkly at odds with that of the callous manipulator conducting an illicit affair portrayed in the report by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel. 1 Years of personal animosity and corrosive bitterness between President Clinton and Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, have repeatedly clouded their judgment and led to excesses on both sides that have permanently tarnished both reputations, say associates of the two men. 1 At the Christian Coalition convention in Washington, many delegates said they were despondent about opinion polls showing that most Americans do not share the conviction that President Clinton should resign or be impeached. 34 Election Focus on Schools Across the country, scores of candidates for Senate and House seats are focusing on schools, vowing that if sent to Washington, they will get the Federal Government involved in cutting the nation's class sizes, repairing school buildings and making them safer for learning. 1 Lasker Awards for Research Six scientists who made discoveries dating to 1960 that identified the genetic basis of cancer and improved the diagnosis and treatment of certain types of the disease will receive this year's Albert Lasker awards.

But it has backfired and mired the town in lawsuits. 1 In Queens, All That Jazz Hardly anyone remembers, but not all that long ago, in this city of jazz, Queens was, quite literally, the home of jazz.
