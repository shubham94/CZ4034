A tenured philosophy professor at City College of New York and the author of ''The Big Questions: How Philosophy Can Change Your Life'' and of the international best seller ''Plato, Not Prozac! Applying Eternal Wisdom to Everyday Problems,'' Marinoff is the world's most successful marketer of philosophical counseling. A controversial new talk therapy, philosophical counseling takes the premise that many of our problems stem from uncertainties about the meaning of life and from faulty logic. Passing through courthouse security, Marinoff placed his World Economic Forum tote bag in the metal detector -- swag from his annual gig in Davos, Switzerland, and filled that morning with documents for Marinoff's lawsuit against his own employer. Claiming a violation of his freedom of speech, the case stems from a C.C.N.Y. moratorium on Marinoff's campus counseling, instituted while administrators looked into liability questions. What if a philosopher with zero mental health training, they worry, fails to recognize a student's suicidal tendencies and prescribes Heidegger instead of psychiatric intervention? The moratorium is no longer officially in effect, but Marinoff is suing for lost income and professional opportunities, and C.C.N.Y. attorneys have also laid out insurance requirements that Marinoff finds utterly offensive: ''We have never, not ever, had a single case in which philosophical counseling caused psychological harm,'' he said in the courthouse elevator. ''These people just can't tell the difference between psychology and philosophy. That's how badly educated people are these days.''", "headline": {"main": "The Socratic Shrink"}, "abstract": "Daniel Duane profile of Lou Marinoff, world's most successful marketer of philosophical counseling, controversial talk therapy based on idea that many psychological problems stem from uncertainties about meaning of life and faulty logic, and his conflicts with fellow practitioners who see him as popularizer and self-promoter who could slow or doom acceptance of their profession by psychotherapeutic establishment; notes that very idea of philosophical counseling is rejected by serious academic philosophers, even those who address timeless questions of human condition: persistence of suffering, inevitability of death and need for reliable ethics; photo (L)", "print_page": "34", "word_count": 2795, "_id": "4fd239118eb7c8105d7ccbb9", "snippet": "On a recent Manhattan morning, with a cold wind slashing off New York Harbor, Lou Marinoff took the granite steps of the federal courthouse two at a time -- brown eyes fierce, ivory white skin offsetting his dark beard, a Russian fur hat making him...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/21/magazine/the-socratic-shrink.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MARINOFF, LOU"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MENTAL HEALTH AND DISORDERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PHILOSOPHY"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Daniel", "lastname": "Duane"}], "original": "By Daniel Duane"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2004-03-21T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 45}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
