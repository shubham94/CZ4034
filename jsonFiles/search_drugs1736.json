By Daniel Laskin Five years ago, a spate of panicky headlines alerted Americans to a new, alarming byproduct of the sexual revolution. Genital herpes - incurable, recurrent and highly contagious - was spreading rapidly. What the early reports did not convey, though, was the psychological damage and medical bafflement herpes would bring with it. Today, this viral infection has not only established itself as an uncontrollable epidemic; it has proved to be one of the most exasperating ailments, for patients and doctors alike. Between five million and 20 million Americans are believed to suffer from herpes, which produces painful, fluid-filled blisters on the genitals. Some of them have such mild bouts that they see the disease as no more than an inconvenience; others are in almost constant pain. Virtually all of them, however, must endure an emotional crisis so distinct in its assault on their sense of worth that psychologists speak of a ''herpes syndrome.'' Across the country, herpes victims find themselves suddenly beset by new vulnerabilities and moral dilemmas. They feel tainted, fearful that no one will ever want to love them - and thus torn over the question of whether to tell new friends and prospective sex partners about their affliction. Women who plan to have children face particularly frightening risks. Newborn babies can pick up the virus in the birth canal, with devastating results.", "headline": {"main": "HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "94", "word_count": 3972, "_id": "4fd11d788eb7c8105d5db6c6", "snippet": "Daniel Laskin is a freelance writer living in Maryland.
