The league's carefully maintained competitive balance almost guarantees that every week will feature several compelling games between high-quality, evenly matched opponents. Almost.Bell would never imagine a week like this, in which the best (the Patriots) and most fascinating (the Eagles, the 49ers) teams have byes, while the top contenders face pushovers and the mediocre slug it out with the middling. Matchups that looked good when the schedule was announced now merit double-digit point spreads. Case in point: the Colts vs. the Saints, a rematch of Super Bowl XLIV that promised to be a seesaw offensive battle, is now little more than a three-hour wake for Indianapolis and a chance to watch Sean Payton coach New Orleans from the booth instead of the sideline.Granted, Curtis Painter, like a frozen burrito under a filling station heat lamp, is slowly warming to the Colts' starting quarterback job. His completion percentage has gone up every week, and the Colts offense no longer looks like an intramural team playing in a downpour. Also, Drew Brees offered hope that Payton might find a way to stand on, or slightly above, the field on the surgically repaired leg he broke in last week's game. \"I'm envisioning some kind of hovercraft on the sideline,\" Brees said. Levitating coaches: another thing that Bert Bell could never imagine.
