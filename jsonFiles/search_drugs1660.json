The projected rise, which does not reflect increased danger from cancer-causing agents, would result instead from a proportionate rise in the number of people surviving into the years when cancer most often arises, according to the study. Nor does the study reflect the possibility that current extensive medical efforts against the disease may succeed in some measure. By the year 2030, the study said, new cancer cases may climb to 1.5 million each year from the current level of 750,000. The study, by Dr. Dwight T. Janerich of the New York State Health Department, is believed the first to assess the projected number of new cancer cases and their economic effect on government and health insurance policies.", "headline": {"main": "INCREASE IN CANCER PREDICTED S MORE PEOPLE LIVE LONGER"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "15", "word_count": 936, "_id": "4fd1530c8eb7c8105d635772", "snippet": "Cancer cases may double among Americans over the next 40 years and the costs of treatment may become an even greater factor in the economy than Government officials have realized, according to a statistical analysis published yesterday in The Journal...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/22/us/increase-in-cancer-predicted-s-more-people-live-longer.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "JANERICH, DWIGHT T"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ALTMAN, LAWRENCE K"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AGE, CHRONOLOGICAL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CANCER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FORECASTS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Lawrence", "middlename": "K.", "lastname": "ALTMAN", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By LAWRENCE K.
