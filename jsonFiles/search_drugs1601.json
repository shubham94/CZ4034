But since last July, when the 52- year-old author and runner James F.

Mr. Fixx was a former magazine editor and author of five books, including the best-selling ''The Complete Book of Running,'' and the idol of many joggers. The doctors - Ira J. Gelb and Jerome Gristina of Larchmont and Norbert W. Sander Jr. of Riverdale - all agree that Mr. Fixx prolonged his life by losing weight, maintaining a good diet and running. But, they added, more important was his genetic makeup - his father died of a heart attack at the age of 43 and he himself was not in good health and should have sought the advice of a physician.", "headline": {"main": "DOCTORS WORK TO DISPEL RUNNERS' PHOBIA"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "word_count": 1162, "_id": "4fd13fce8eb7c8105d616a62", "snippet": "STRENUOUS exercise, especially running and often to the point of exertion, is a key factor in maintaining good health and prolonging life, according to three doctors in the county who are working together to encourage people to stay fit.
