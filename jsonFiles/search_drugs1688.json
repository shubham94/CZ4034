Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, was first seen in homosexual men - particularly those who were promiscuous - but it has now struck so many different groups that its course cannot be predicted. And despite a massive nationwide microbe hunt involving hundreds of investigators and millions of dollars, scientists simply cannot catch up with it.

Both groups are caught up in a version of the ancient tug-of-war between the selfless pursuit of knowledge and the selfish pursuit of money. Should universities, many of which are suffering financially, accept millions of dollars from corporations hoping for future products from the fruits of biologists' basic research? Are individual biologists justified in setting up their own companies to profit from discoveries they made within the shadow of the ivory tower? The issues have generated conferences among university presidents, hearings before Congress and many other public and private expressions of concern. The Background The new techniques of manipulating the genes of living cells have made possible a host of potential products and processes. The industry based on such techniques of genetic manipulation is just getting started. Products for medicine and agriculture are likely to come first. Indeed, the first major medical product, human insulin manufactured on a large scale by genetically engineered bacteria, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last fall.", "headline": {"main": "INDUSTRY-ACADEMIC TIES: PROFIT OVER PROGRESS?", "kicker": "ISSUE AND DEBATE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "5", "word_count": 1332, "_id": "4fd12c108eb7c8105d5f5bd3", "snippet": "THE revolution in biological research popularly known as genesplicing promises to make millionaires of some laboratory biologists and nervous wrecks of university administrators.
