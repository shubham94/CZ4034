As a result, blood bank officials and Federal scientists estimate that up to 5 percent of donations may be discarded in the coming year just to reduce the spread of the viral liver disease by one-third. Four million Americans a year get transfusions, and Federal studies indicate that 5 percent to 10 percent are being infected with the unidentified virus or viruses that cause the non-A, non-B type of hepatitis, according to Dr. Harvey G. Klein, chief of transfusion medicine at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health. One in three of these infected people will eventually suffer symptoms of chronic hepatitis, he said. And it is estimated that at least one in 20, or 10,000 to 20,000 a year, will develop cirrhosis, a potentially fatal liver disease, as much as 10 or 20 years after infection.", "snippet": "Evidence that blood transfusions are giving some recipients a dangerous form of hepatitis has become so compelling that the nation's blood banks have decided to screen donations for it even though they lack a precise test.
