The fingering of yet another external reason for weight gain seems never-ending, but in the case of microbes, we may be playing with fire. The commensal bacteria living within our bodies are the end result of millions of years of germ warfare, with the current inhabitants making it their evolutionary job to keep out the bad guys and to regulate a number of important processes, the least of which may be extracting calories from such things as undigested fiber. Jeff Leach New Orleans Genes and germs are old. Obesity is new. Obesity rates have skyrocketed during the past half-century in lock step with increasing portion sizes, fast food, processed food. There is little to suggest that genes, germs or intestinal flora have changed appreciably over this interval. While there may be insights about obesity to be gained from peering through a microscope, there is also the risk of missing the big picture. The obvious causes of epidemic obesity are all around us. Any theory that diverts our attention from them may do more harm than good. David L. Katz, M.D. Associate Professor of Public Health Yale University School of Medicine New Haven Declaring an obesity epidemic may be raising an unnecessary alarm, and seeking all possible causes of obesity may be less important than determining who is truly at health risk because of weight.According to the body-mass index, I teeter on the threshold of being overweight, at 5 feet 2 inches and 140 pounds. I am able to walk or bike the 2 miles to work with little effort, and have been known to canoe upstream against the wind for longer than might seem reasonable. I have a friend of the same height and20 pounds heavier who regularly runs marathons. Should she and I be miserable, feeling hungry and denied, trying to lose weight? There are certainly people for whom excess weight is a serious medical concern, but I wager that many who make up the ''obesity epidemic'' are healthy and fit and whose body type or metabolism allows for a few reserve pounds in case of a sudden shortage of pasta primavera and garlic bread. Karen Bassler Madison, Wis. Thirty-six years ago, my fianc\u00e9 did not believe that my fight with weight was ''real.'' I offered to go to the doctor of his choice for whatever testing was deemed appropriate. I had a basal metabolism test, and the following week we met in the doctor's office. He looked at me and said: ''I have good news and bad news, and they are both the same. If there were 100 people on a desert island and no food, you would be the last one left alive.'' It is nice to know that today at least we have the science to back up that assertion.
