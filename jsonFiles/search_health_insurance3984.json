So you brace yourself for the worst as you pick up Lawrence Joseph's new book, ''Lawyerland: What Lawyers Talk About When They Talk About Law.'' Mr. Joseph, who is himself a lawyer as well as a published poet (''Shouting at No One,'' ''Curriculum Vitae,'' ''Before Our Eyes''), apparently believes that lawyers behave among themselves differently from the way they do with people outside their profession. So he set out to meet in downtown Manhattan with as many different types of lawyers as he could find -- corporate, criminal, labor, personal injury, medical malpractice and so forth -- to get them to talk openly about their profession.", "headline": {"main": "Tort and Retort: Lawyers v.
