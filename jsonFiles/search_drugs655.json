That question is at the center of the most recent battle here in the Freud Wars, the epic (or as the man himself might say, interminable) struggle over the legacy of Sigmund Freud, pioneer psychotherapist, cartographer of the unconscious and former resident of Hampstead, the leafy corner of Northwest London where the concentration of therapeutic couches per square mile may be even higher than on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Late last year a new group calling itself the College of Psychoanalysts sent out a letter inviting British therapists who met certain qualifications to list themselves on the organization's ''register of practitioners.'' The British Psychoanalytical Society, headquarters of classical Freudian analysis, responded with a statement accusing college members of ''misleading the public about their training and qualifications.'' And then the fireworks really started. One founder of the college -- which is a professional organization rather than a training institution -- countered with a letter describing the society's action as ''a phobic response to growth as symbolized in the Oedipal myth.'' An opponent of the college, on the other hand, described the new group as ''an association of wannabes and poseurs.''", "headline": {"main": "Calling All Ids: Freudians at War"}, "abstract": "Article on dispute among British psychoanalysts and therapists over call by College of Psychoanalysts, which is professional organization rather than training institution, inviting British therapists who meet certain qualifications to list themselves on its register of practitioners; British Psychoanalytical Society, headquarters of classical Freudian analysis, has accused college members of misleading public about training and qualifications; photo; drawing (M)", "print_page": "7", "word_count": 1340, "_id": "4fd27d4f8eb7c8105d8448ec", "snippet": "Who owns psychoanalysis?
