Meanwhile, the district attorney's investigation into the case continues. An accompanying article by John Sullivan notes that the inspection system was revamped after seven people died in a Harlem apartment fire in 1987. But the scale of the work involved, with New York's dense network of buildings, is daunting. Firefighters conduct general inspections while civilians perform reviews of critical systems like sprinklers.
