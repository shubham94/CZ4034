He and his staff watched the children all day, every day, noting short breaths and long ones, irregular breaths and clean ones. In a camp where the air seemed as clear as Bermuda water, here is what they found: When the readings for the pollution haze, otherwise known as smog, were low, the children had less trouble taking breaths. When the smog readings increased, the children struggled. The children may be struggling more often, because smog is increasing in the state. Connecticut made the top 10 list for states beset by smog problems in a study released in August by the United States Public Interest Research Group titled ''Danger in the Air, the 2001 Ozone Season Summary.'' The Boston office of the Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees New England, has deemed smog the foremost pollutant in Connecticut. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has filed -- and is threatening to file -- lawsuits in an effort to stop more pollutants from entering Connecticut. From Salisbury in the northwest corner of the state, to Manchester in the east, the quality of the air has residents signing petitions, pounding placards into their lawns and calling city hall and the Department of Environmental Protection to complain.", "snippet": "FOR one week over the course of several summers, at a pastoral camp for asthmatic children in the Connecticut River Valley, Dr. Jonathan Fine watched children breathe.
