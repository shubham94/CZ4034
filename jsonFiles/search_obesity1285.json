The study, whose findings will appear in the Friday issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, was undertaken after research among hundreds of adopted children indicated that bodily shapes was determined more by genetics than by eating habits. ''Up to now, there has been a lot of doubt about whether obesity in humans was genetically determined,'' Dr. Albert J. Stunkard, a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia, who directed both studies, said today.

This is not a secret, nor is it magic. But most diet books promise both - a secret that works like magic, producing instant weight loss without pain. It is a promise they cannot keep. And sometimes dieters get more than they bargained for - weight loss at the cost of their health. Martin Katahn, a psychologist with a Ph.D. from Syracuse University who is the director of the Weight Management Program at Vanderbilt University, makes weight-loss promises that apparently can be kept - at least over the short term. He has done so with ''The Rotation Diet'' (W. W. Norton, $15.95). Instead of having people on a highly restrictive, low-calorie diet until the desired weight is achieved - that is, with an end some unknowable time in the future - Dr. Katahn offers a built-in psychological boost, a diet that limits its restrictive phase: for women, 3 days at 600 calories; 4 days at 900 calories; a week at 1,200, then a week of the 600/900 calorie plan.", "snippet": "ANYONE can lose weight by taking in fewer calories than are expended.
