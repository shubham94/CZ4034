But now, though only in her 50's, her face was etched with wrinkles, her features gaunt-looking with prominent underlying bones and her skin shriveled and gray with purplish blotches. Diagnosis: smoker's face. Dr. Douglas Model of Eastbourne, England, added this condition to the medical lexicon in 1985 after surveying 116 patients and correctly identifying roughly half of current smokers by their facial features alone. The distinctive characteristics of smoker's face, which makes people look far older than their years, were present in 19 (46 percent) current smokers, 3 (8 percent) former smokers and no nonsmokers, irrespective of age, social class, recent weight fluctuations and exposure to sunlight. To illustrate his point, he included photographs of some famous and nonfamous smokers and nonsmokers, including the wrinkled face of the poet W. H. Auden.", "snippet": "THE doctor could tell the patient had once been an attractive woman.
