It is not that there is no substance behind the American approach to Russia today. There is. And it is not that there is no money behind it, either. It is that no more money will be delivered, or make a substantive difference, unless President Boris N. Yeltsin puts together a viable, concrete plan to restructure his budget in a way that will curb inflation, end subsidies to unprofitable state industries and create a body of laws to support a free market. Bear Hugs and Vodka That was President Clinton's message to the Russian leader this week.
