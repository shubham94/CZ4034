Ever since the Chinese Revolution of 1949, policies have changed so frequently and so quickly that students of the People's Republic of China often find their books are out of date by the time they are published. This is especially true today because the Deng Xiaoping leadership has launched a series of dramatic reforms that are radically restructuring China's economy. Nevertheless, ''Chen Village'' and ''The Chinese Hospital,'' though dated in some respects, depict in rich detail the background against which reforms are being carried out.   The books differ from several excellent general works on Chinese society in that they are, respectively, studies of a specific village (in south China) and a specific institution (a teaching hospital in the industrial city of Wuhan). ''Chen Village'' is based on interviews conducted in Hong Kong with emigres from Chen. ''The Chinese Hospital'' is derived from on-site observations and on interviews conducted in China. This single-case approach penetrates to the bottom layer of Chinese society, but perhaps because of the absence of official constraints, the interviews conducted in Hong Kong present a richer, more in-depth view of Chinese society that those conducted in China.    The authors of ''Chen Village'' vividly bring to life the effect of the Chinese Communist Party's constantly changing policies on the villagers from the mid-1960's through the early 80's. They describe how the party's 1963-65 campaign against corruption and its introduction of new rice hybrids, irrigation and transportation systems led to a doubling of peasant income and an economic boom. But these advances were gradually undermined by forces set in motion during the Cultural Revolution (1966- 1969).       Generally, the Cultural Revolution has been regarded as an urban phenomenon, but the description of its impact on Chen village shows it had a destructive effect in the countryside as well. Its witch hunting and organized violence intensified infighting among the villagers, and its unworkable economic programs led to a decline in production. Still, education in the village continued to expand; a three-room schoolhouse with some 40 pupils grew into a school with 10 teachers and 300 pupils by 1970. But, exasperated by the chaotic politics and policy shifts of the 70's, the villagers concentrated their energies on their own small private farm plots and neglected the village collective. Moreover, provoked by city youth sent into the countryside, the villagers questioned party policies as did their urban counterparts.   Although its authors discuss China's recent reforms only briefly, ''The Chen Village'' helps explain why the party was virtually forced to decollectivize much of Chinese society in order to encourage  Merle Goldman teaches Chinese history at Boston University. Her latest book is ''China's Intellectuals: Advise and Dissent.'' the peasants to increase production. By signing long-term contracts with the party, peasant families have again become small-scale cultivators. Although not new in Chinese history, this development is revolutionary in the context of the party's collectivist goals.       ''The Chinese Hospital'' is a study of a large urban medical complex, and it also provides a sense of the nitty-gritty of everyday Chinese life. The authors' description of the    danwei,  the basic unit of almost all urban work places, seen here as it operates within a hospital, is the most detailed analysis of this major Chinese institution. The    danwei  combines social, economic and political functions. Thus, in addition to providing jobs for its members, it takes care of housing, education, food, clothing and medical care and is also in charge of surveillance and party indoctrination. Individuals in the    danwei  have some say, especially if they are professionals, but major decision-making rests with a party leader. It is a hierarchical, authoritarian system, and its control over its members extends to the most intimate matters, such as the selection of a spouse and the decision to have a child.   The authors also describe the workings of a Chinese hospital, and their description will be of special interest to health-care professionals because China's medical system is extraordinary by the standards of underdeveloped countries. From 1949 to 1981, the average life expectancy increased from 35 to 68 years, which compares favorably with that of developed countries. In part, this is due to the kind of sophisticated health care provided by the hospital the authors describe in detail. In greater part, it has to do with the ''barefoot doctors,'' the paramedics in the countryside, whom the authors discuss briefly. They provide basic health care and are concerned with immunization, sanitation and the control of communicable diseases. In Chen village, not a single baby died from 1970 to 1975.   Since these two books were written, the economic reforms in China have affected the health-care system with unintended consequences. As decollectivization has diminished the funding of social services provided by collectives, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of paramedics, and an increase in medical costs. A paramedic bought the health-care clinic in Chen village and raised fees. And many paramedics now find it more profitable to till their own plots. A recent issue of The New England Journal of Medicine reports a decline in health care in the countryside. And the reforms may also affect the    danwei  by lessening its control over individuals. As the party promotes small private enterprises in the cities, it becomes possible for people to buy food and clothing outside the    danwei,  and some are increasingly able to earn a living without going through the party bureaucracy.    Although the authors of these books were unable to deal with the social implications of the economic reforms of the Deng Xiaoping leadership, their books help us to understand the forces that led to those reforms and to appreciate the magnitude of what is being attempted. And as anyone who has studied the People's Republic knows, policy changes occur so often that by the time other new books on the reforms appear, China may have already returned to the more tightly controlled collectivized society these authors have so sensitively described.B"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1984-10-07T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts; Books"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 22}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
