Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt., where he is an outpatient. It's not a talk show or movie that holds his attention, but a video in which patients and physicians speak in stark terms about prostate surgery. Dillon, a 74-year-old retired building inspector, has an enlarged prostate, a condition affecting more than 300,000 American men over age 50 each year. It is not life threatening, but causes such unpleasant symptoms as abdominal pain and difficulty urinating. Dillon's doctor asked him to watch the video to get a broad range of opinions about the benefits and drawbacks of the operation. Some patients in the video say they are glad they had the surgery because they no longer experience pain and frustration trying to urinate. But others plainly regret it. Prostate surgery can damage the sphincter muscle, causing retrograde ejaculation, or dry orgasms. One man said that he was stunned at the effect the operation had on his sex life.", "headline": {"main": "Rx for a System in Crisis"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "word_count": 2041, "_id": "4fd19c4a8eb7c8105d6add05", "snippet": "For half an hour, Edward Dillon has been watching television in a small basement room at the V.A.
