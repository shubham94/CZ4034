The announcement caught both children totally by surprise. They knew their parents had dissimilar personalities, but they had never heard them fight. They were a close-knit family, and often took trips together, rafting in Colorado one year, touring Spain another. So this announcement seemed catastrophic. ''I felt like I'd been hit by a steamroller,'' says Jamie, now 15. ''The world was coming apart. That's all I knew.'' After their father moved out of their New York City apartment, Laura's marks in school went down, and six months later she failed for the first time to make the honor roll. Usually outgoing, Laura became quiet and withdrawn and began to spend a good deal of time at home in her room. Jamie's marks worsened, too, along with his behavior. He went to school unprepared, was rude on several occasions to his teachers and refused to see his father at all. He wasn't much nicer to his friends, and pretty soon they stopped including him in their plans.", "headline": {"main": "THE SONS OF DIVORCE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "40", "word_count": 3984, "_id": "4fd12e158eb7c8105d5f93a5", "snippet": "JAMIE WAS 14 AND HIS SISTER, LAURA, was 12 when their parents told them they were getting a divorce.
