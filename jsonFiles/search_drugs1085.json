When the magnet is placed at the back of his head, say on the left side, he will perceive a huge blind spot in his right eye.", "headline": {"main": "Pulsing Magnets Offer New Method Of Mapping Brain"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2057, "_id": "4fd1f20a8eb7c8105d748e9f", "snippet": "A PSYCHIATRIST presses a small, hand-held device over a patient's skull.

Once recognized and properly treated, depression can usually be relieved, restoring the zest for life and all it has to offer. Depression can be lifted in two-thirds to three-fourths of patients by antidepressant medications, including the tricyclics, like Elavil, Tofranil and Wellbutrin; monoamine-oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, like Nardil and Marplan, and the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (S.S.R.I.'s) like Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil. In February alone, 3.4 million prescriptions were issued for the serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. But for many people treated with these and other psychiatric drugs, the remedy, though highly effective in making life meaningful again, falls short in a major sphere. Instead of raising libido and the ability to achieve sexual fulfillment, popular antidepressants commonly cause a loss of interest in sex and block the ability to achieve sexual satisfaction.", "headline": {"main": "Personal Health"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 1065, "_id": "4fd1d3dc8eb7c8105d71047b", "snippet": "DEPRESSION surrounds people with a life-draining cloud that typically saps their joy, energy and desire for work, play, food and sex.
