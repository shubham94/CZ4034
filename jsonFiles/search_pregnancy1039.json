By Georgi Gospodinov. Translated by Zornitsa Hristova. (Dalkey Archive, paper, $12.50.) Gospodinov flits and buzzes among various subjects -- from graffiti in public toilets to the movies of Quentin Tarantino -- in this tale of a young Bulgarian writer who decides to create his own version of a ''natural novel'' assembled from the bits and pieces of everyday life. At its center is a poignant story about the narrator's divorce and the fact that he isn't ''the author'' of his soon-to-be-ex-wife's pregnancy. Maybe he's suffering from attention deficit disorder; maybe he's just stuck with a skewed if stoic appreciation of life's messy flux. Whatever the cause, his monologue turns into a quirky, compulsively readable book that deftly hints at the emptiness and sadness at its core. DIARY OF ANDR\u00c9S FAVA. By Julio Cort\u00e1zar. Translated by Anne McLean. (Archipelago, paper, $14.) This previously unpublished portion of an early work by Cort\u00e1zar is actually a fragment of a fragment. Ostensibly the daily jottings of Andr\u00e9s Fava, a peripheral character in the novel ''Final Exam,'' the text offers a whirlwind voyage through Cort\u00e1zar's mind. Written in 1950 and set in an eerie, fog-bound Buenos Aires, it anticipates the mental games and mortal quests of the great Argentine writer's masterpiece, ''Hopscotch,'' and more experimental works like ''Cronopios and Famas'' and ''Around the Day in Eighty Worlds.'' Overflowing with existential riffs and noirish turns, the narrative also features notes on jazz and appearances by phantasmagoric creatures of the imagination. ''This notebook is a cage full of monsters,'' Cort\u00e1zar writes, ''and outside is Buenos Aires.''", "headline": {"main": "FICTION CHRONICLE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "28", "word_count": 705, "_id": "4fd284b78eb7c8105d853fd1", "snippet": "New books by Georgi Gospodinov, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Nuria Amat, Patrik Ourednik and Enrique Vila-Matas.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/books/review/05TEPP01.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "imagepages/2005/05/30/books/05books-teppe2.html", "rank": "2", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupHeight2": "325", "MultimediaUrl2": "imagepages/2005/05/30/books/05books-teppe2.html", "MultimediaPopupWidth2": "250", "MultimediaType2": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "imagepages/2005/05/30/books/05books-tepp1.html", "rank": "1", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupWidth1": "250", "MultimediaUrl1": "imagepages/2005/05/30/books/05books-tepp1.html", "MultimediaPopupHeight1": "325", "MultimediaType1": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "imagepages/2005/05/30/books/05books-tepp3.html", "rank": "3", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupHeight3": "325", "MultimediaPopupWidth3": "250", "MultimediaUrl3": "imagepages/2005/05/30/books/05books-tepp3.html", "MultimediaType3": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Anderson", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Tepper"}], "original": "By Anderson Tepper"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-06-05T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts; Books"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Women's Health", "lead_paragraph": "ROXANNE PEREZ had never really been sick in her life until, at age 27, the roof began falling in.
