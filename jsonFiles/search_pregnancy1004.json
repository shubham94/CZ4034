Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first installment of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, this production pulses with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast, led by Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called ''Little'' Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) 'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood-style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant. (1:35) 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates) 'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger) 'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective. Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger) 'DURANGO' In Julia Cho's tender-hearted comedy-drama, a Korean-American family takes to the road with a trunk full of emotional baggage in tow. The narrative mostly runs in familiar grooves, but Ms. Cho has a clear, honest voice, and Chay Yew's production sets it off elegantly (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) 'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates) 'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) 'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE' A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quip-meisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). The SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) 'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Moli\u00e8re's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Gates) * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE TIMEKEEPERS' Dan Clancy's play, which throws a Jewish artisan and a gay hustler together in a concentration camp, transcends standard Holocaust psychodrama on the strength of its characterizations and definitive performances by Seth Barrish and Eric Paeper (1:35). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, third floor, (212) 760-2615. (Rob Kendt) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) Off Off Broadway 'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette) Spectacles 'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing Cliff's Notes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30).

(Brantley) Last Chance 'GREAT EXPECTATIONS' It's hard to improve on Dickens, and the playwright Bathsheba Doran doesn't manage to in the Theatreworks/USA production of her version for families and children. Directed by Will Pomerantz, scenes fly by too fast, and Kathleen Chalfant's Miss Havisham should be frightening rather than eccentric. But as her icy prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Estella, Kristen Bush is near perfect (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens) 'JOB'S PASSION' The Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin's blending of two biblical characters, Job and Jesus, sometimes flaunts irreverence for irreverence's sake but finds both dizzying humor and rich meaning in human misery (2:00).

(Gates) 'MIMI LE DUCK' This musical, seen in 2004 at the New York International Fringe Festival, has morphed into a campy celebration of Eartha Kitt, who, just short of her 80th birthday, milks a minor role gleefully. The main order of business, though, is a middle-aged, middle-American housewife (Annie Golden), who, at the urging of Hemingway's ghost, goes to Paris in search of her true self. Diana Hansen-Young, who wrote the book and lyrics, seems to get most of her not-very-revolutionary ideas from mainstream women's magazines (2:05).

(Jason Zinoman) 'WOYZECK' This improbably vivacious London-born production of Buchner's great, prophetic drama of existential emptiness finds the bleak rhythm of life in, of all things, the music of Elvis Presley.

(Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, who died in June. (A. O. Scott) 'BACKSTAGE' (No rating, 112 minutes, in French) Beautifully acted and uncomfortably believable much of the time, this close-up study of the toxic relationship of a narcissistic French pop star and a besotted teenage fan produces a feeling of emotional claustrophobia. (Stephen Holden) 'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott) * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis) 'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis) 'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott) 'D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. ( Dargis) 'DHOOM 2' (No rating, 151 minutes, in Hindi) A slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. Hrithik Roshan plays the ''smartest and coolest thief alive,'' and Aishwarya Rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (Rachel Saltz) 'EATING OUT 2: SLOPPY SECONDS' (No rating, 85 minutes) A Rubik's Cube of shifting sexual orientation and elaborate fantasies, this film follows a young gay man who joins an ''ex-gay'' group in his quest to bed a hot male model. Gathering all the accouterments of soft pornography -- cheesy music, low-rent acting and attractively framed genitals -- into a plot of stunning imbecility, the director, Phillip J. Bartel, is most amusing in his zeal to demonstrate the fruitlessness of right-wing efforts to reorient gay men. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expos\u00e9 of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott) * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis) 'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer from a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden) * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott) 'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott) 'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, except for the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden) 'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis) 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden) 'INVISIBLE' (No rating, 86 minutes) Absent parents cause no end of bother in this moody thriller about an unhappily married couple, a remote cabin and a pair of homicidal crazies. Unfortunately, the director, Adam Watstein, is so invested in his theme of nature as emotional healer that the movie's abrupt transition from lush travelogue to murky violence feels jarring and unearned. As both victims and attackers trade abandonment issues ''Invisible'' suggests that weekend getaways are best approached, if not with a pistol, then at least with a firm grasp of psychobabble. (Catsoulis) 'LET'S GO TO PRISON' (R, 84 minutes) Sure, it has shower scenes, but they're sly and restrained rather than frat house obvious, and all the funnier for it. Dax Shepard is hilariously deadpan as a petty criminal who retaliates against a judge by contriving for the man's son (Will Arnett) to be arrested and then purposely being arrested himself so he can harass the prissy fellow. Chi McBride is perfect as a fellow inmate with a taste for prison lovin' and a voice like Barry White's. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'OUR DAILY BREAD' (No rating, 92 minutes) In this superb documentary the Austrian filmmaker Nikolaus Geyrhalter takes an unblinking, often disturbing look at industrial food production from field to factory. You are what you eat; as it happens, you are also what you dare to watch. (Dargis) 'TENACIOUS D IN THE PICK OF DESTINY' (R, 87 minutes) As it wobbles from one episode to the next, this rock 'n' roll comedy starring Jack Black is a garish mess, and some of it feels padded. But it has enough jokes to keep you smiling, and Mr. Black brings to it a fervent affection for the music he spoofs but obviously adores. (Holden) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar, with Pen\u00e9lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) Film Series JACQUES AUDIARD RETROSPECTIVE (Tuesday) Cin\u00e9ma Tuesdays at the French Institute Alliance Fran\u00e7aise concludes its five-week tribute to Mr. Audiard, a contemporary master of the French thriller, next week.

(Gates) HEROIC GRACE II: SHAW BROTHERS RETURN (Through Wednesday) BAMcin\u00e9matek and the U.C.L.A. Film & Television Archive Shaw Brothers series, honoring the Chinese movie studio that spread the gospel of martial arts films, winds up next week. Tuesday's feature is Chor Yuen's ''Clans of Intrigue'' (1977), about a swordsman framed for murder. Wednesday's is Chang Cheh and Bao Zueli's ''Boxer From Shantung'' (1972), about a young fighter who succumbs to bad influences in the big city. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Gates) WALTER MIRISCH (Through Dec. 31) To honor Mr. Mirisch, 85, the New York-born producer, the Museum of Modern Art is sponsoring a retrospective of 12 films from the Mirisch Corporation, beginning tonight. This weekend's films include ''In the Heat of the Night'' (1967), Norman Jewison's Oscar-winning crime drama about racial tensions in the Deep South; ''West Side Story'' (1961), Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins's Oscar-winning adaptation of the Broadway musical; and ''Some Like It Hot'' (1959), Billy Wilder's comedy classic in which Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon all wear dresses. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates) MONDOVINO: THE SERIES (Through Dec. 10) Technically, ''Mondovino,'' Jonathan Nossiter's 10-hour documentary about winemaking, is one film. But the Museum of Modern Art is presenting its theatrical world premiere as five two-hour programs, beginning tomorrow. The story begins in Southern France, travels to Tuscany and the New World, and includes a portrait of the wine critic Robert Parker. An all-weekend marathon of the 10 parts is also scheduled. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. RYAN ADAMS AND THE CARDINALS (Monday through Wednesday) No one exemplifies the frustrations of alt-country better: so much talent, so much rich history to draw on, so much arrogance. But at least Mr. Adams can deliver the goods. Within his unnecessarily voluminous output -- he released three full-length albums last year and posts new songs to his Web site by the dozen -- is some astonishingly beautiful work. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; sold out. (Ben Sisario) BLIND BOYS OF ALABAMA (Tomorrow) After more than 60 years as a group, the Blind Boys of Alabama are no longer boys, but gray-haired pillars of gospel quartet singing. Led by Clarence Fountain, they proclaim their reverence in close harmonies and gutsy improvisations that leap heavenward. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $42.50 in advance, $45 at the door. (Jon Pareles) BRIAN JONESTOWN MASSACRE (Sunday) This tuneless headache of a band, modeled on the jangly psychedelic rock of mid-1960s Britain and Los Angeles, was well on its way into obscurity when, two years ago, it was featured in a hit documentary, ''Dig!,'' and a legend was created. Since then the band has toured widely, to audiences who wait for its leader, Anton Newcombe, to lash out in paranoia and kick a fan in the head, as he did in the film. With A Place to Bury Strangers. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario) CONVERGE (Tonight) The guitar riffs of this Boston band come like a spray of machine gun bullets, rapid and unrelenting. The violent rasp of Jacob Bannon, the singer, is just as deadly. With Some Girls, Modern Life Is War, and Blacklisted. At 6, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) COPELAND (Sunday) Rueful piano ballads that lead to teary, guitar-drenched, not-quite-cathartic peaks: the songs of this Florida band strongly resemble those of Coldplay and Keane. But while its passion is sincere, Copeland lacks something in the sophistication department. (''I'm in love with my doubt/It's freaking me out.'') With Appleseed Cast, Owen and Acute. At 6:45 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) GENO DELAFOSE AND FRENCH ROCKIN' BOOGIE (Monday) Geno Delafose, the son of the zydeco accordionist John Delafose, holds on to the traditions of an older generation, pumping waltzes and two-steps and blues on his button accordion, keeping the old bayou flavor. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6; Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $22. (Pareles) DINOSAUR JR. (Tonight and tomorrow night) One of the greatest and most influential original grunge bands, Dinosaur Jr. joined mopey lyrics to furious guitar sludge, a juxtaposition that prefigured Nirvana. Long estranged, the original lineup of J Mascis on guitar, Lou Barlow on bass and Murph on drums reunited last year, sounding brawny and vigorous; their first album together in 18 years is to be released in the spring. At 9, Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $25. (Sisario) EL VEZ (Tomorrow) Most Elvis imitators are corny; El Vez is conceptual, merging Presleyana, Mexican-American in-jokes and bad puns to honor and simultaneously twist the Presley legacy. At 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Pareles) JEREMY ENIGK (Thursday) In the 1990s Mr. Enigk was the leader of Sunny Day Real Estate, a Seattle group that did as much as anybody to transform emo from a relatively obscure offshoot of hardcore punk into the populist form of yearning and tantrum-throwing that it is today. This fall he released his first solo album in a decade, ''World Waits'' (Lewis Hollow). At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) MELISSA FERRICK (Monday) Somewhere between Ani DiFranco and Melissa Etheridge, Ms. Ferrick slings an acoustic guitar and belts songs filled with bravado. At 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles) * THE GRATES (Wednesday) Playful and capricious, this guitar-drums-vocals trio from Brisbane, Australia, led by the frequently airborne Patience Hodgson, reaches back to classic 1990s riot grrrl for its passionate amateurism. But on its ambitious debut album, ''Gravity Won't Get You High'' (Cherrytree/Interscope), the band is unburdened by any legacy, going from hip-swaying sassy to defiant and tough, all with a sense that nothing in life is worth getting too upset about (''No I'll never believe the truth in you/Lies are much more fun''). With the White Rabbits, Tigercity and Cassettes Won't Listen. At 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario) JOAN JETT AND the blackhearts (Tomorrow) With a never-changing arsenal of meaty riffs, sneering looks and defiant declarations of sexual independence, Joan Jett, now in her late 40s, has been expertly playing the tough-chick-with-a-guitar role longer than many of her younger imitators have been alive. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) JUNIOR BOYS (Thursday) When dance music goes sad: squiggly, awkward beats and droopy keyboards surround the forlorn vocals of this Canadian electronic group, who sing about missed birthdays and phones that don't ring. Also on the bill is a D.J. set by Morgan Geist. At 9 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $15. (Sisario) KLEZMATICS (Monday) This veteran New York band has had a major influence on the bohemian rediscovery and reinvention of klezmer music, the somewhat jazzy dance music of Eastern European Jews. So it made perfect sense when Nora Guthrie, the daughter and archivist of Woody Guthrie, approached the members a few years ago to write music for lyrics that Guthrie wrote in the 1940s and '50s, when he lived on Coney Island with his second wife, Marjorie Mazia, and her Jewish family. There the Dust Bowl troubadour ate blintzes, lighted the menorah and wrote about Hanukkah in the plainspoken, unmistakably Guthrie style: ''It's honeyky Hanukkah, shaky my hand/My candles are burning all over this land.'' The Klezmatics play these songs, as collected on a new album, ''Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah'' (Jewish Music Group). At 7:30 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, henrystreet.org/arts; $20. (Sisario) DAVID KRAKAUER'S KLEZMER MADNESS (Tomorrow) Well into an illustrious career as a classical clarinetist, Mr. Krakauer stumbled onto klezmer, and his endless curiosity in adapting it to avant-garde jazz, rock and even Latin styles has brought him a wide new audience. For this concert he collaborates with Fred Wesley, the funk trombonist who was a key member of James Brown's band in the 1960s and '70s; and with SoCalled, a k a Josh Dolgin, a Canadian D.J. and keyboardist whose efforts at infusing hip-hop with Jewish identity -- or perhaps the other way around -- include an album, ''The SoCalled Seder'' (JDub). At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $35. (Sisario) LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES (Tonight) Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, latch on to dance grooves from the last three decades: James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960s boogaloo, '70s Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rap, while the lyrics (in Spanish) are come-ons somewhere between charm and smarm. At midnight, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $23. (Pareles) * LOW (Wednesday) With exquisite care, this band from Duluth, Minn., featuring the husband-and-wife team of Alan Sparhawk on guitar and Mimi Parker on vocals, and Matt Livingston on bass, creates hushed, stark songs on a vast sonic scale. This concert is advertised as a special performance with a variety of unnamed ''musical friends.'' At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) MARITIME (Sunday) Founded by former members of the Promise Ring and the Dismemberment Plan, two foundational emo bands of the mid-90s, Maritime plays understated and effortlessly catchy songs with minimal touches of acoustic guitar and new-wave keyboards. With Tall Hands. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $10. (Sisario) * LE MYST\u00c8RE DES VOIX BULGARES (Sunday) Formed in 1952 as the Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Vocal Choir (but known since the '80s by this considerably sexier name, originally an album title), this group performs complex modern arrangements of traditional Bulgarian folk and Byzantine liturgical styles. The concept is high, but the effect of the pungently close harmonies and intense percussive yips is immediate and transcendent. At 7:30 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario) NEW MODEL ARMY (Wednesday and Thursday) New Model Army, an English band founded in the early 1980s by the songwriter Justin Sullivan, has held onto the vehement idealism and revved-up guitars of the British punk-rock pioneered by the Clash. With Echoes and Shadows. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $12. Thursday at 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Pareles) OTEP (Monday) These Ozzfest vets play brutal noise-metal but are notable mainly for their leader, Otep Shamaya, a smallish woman with the voice of a roaring bear who wears T-shirts with slogans like ''strong aggressive female'' and sings about sexual abuse. With Ground to Machine. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10. (Sisario) * 'RED HOT + RIOT LIVE' (Tonight and tomorrow night) A tribute to the inimitable Fela Kuti, the Nigerian master of Afrobeat who, on dozens of albums from the early 1970s until his death from AIDS nine years ago, merged James Brown's funk with the chants and polyrhythms of Africa, and used his music as a populist political cudgel against corrupt authority. The lineup for this concert, a benefit for the African Services Committee, an AIDS and H.I.V. support group, includes Tony Allen, Fela's longtime drummer; the eclectic Nigerian duo Amadou and Mariam; Cheikh Lo, from Senegal; Meshell Ndegeocello, the American bassist and funk ambassador; Dead Prez, a politically minded rap duo from Brooklyn; Keziah Jones, a Nigerian singer-songwriter; and Yerba Buena, a New York Latin band, playing with the jazz-funk keyboardist John Medeski. At 7:30, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $25 to $65. (Sisario) THE STILLS (Tonight and tomorrow night) On its debut album three years ago, this Montreal band took the sulking guitar minimalism of New York groups like Interpol and the Strokes and sublimated it into a shimmering, majestic gloom that recalled the glories of U2 and Echo and the Bunnymen. Its most recent album, ''Without Feathers'' (Vice), perplexingly slows things down to a bored crawl. With Au Revoir Simone and Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin tonight, and Favourite Sons and A Brief Smile tomorrow night. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) UMPHREY'S McGEE (Tonight and tomorrow night) One of the few jam bands to gain critical respect in the rock world, Umphrey's McGee, from South Bend, Ind., seamlessly incorporates the irregular meters and gnarled guitar patterns of classic progressive rock into the smoother, more spoonful-of-sugar textures more common in its milieu, a feat of reconciliation that impresses the connoisseurs and keeps everybody else on their feet.

Opera 'LA BOH\u00c8ME' (Tonight and Tuesday) Franco Zeffirelli's overblown ''Boh\u00e8me'' returns to the Met for its regular airing. Rolando Villaz\u00f3n, the charismatic Mexican tenor, is a convincing Rodolfo, although he seems somewhat dwarfed by the massive sets. But sparks should fly on Tuesday when Anna Netrebko, the gorgeous Russian soprano, sings Mimi. Tonight Angela Marambio, the Chilean soprano, offers a warm-voiced, robust Mimi. Mr. Villaz\u00f3n's mentor and idol, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, leads the orchestra in a fine, lively performance. Anna Samuil replaces Susannah Glanville as Musetta both nights, and Peter Coleman-Wright is her jealous lover, Marcello. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 and $140 tickets remain for tonight; Tuesday is sold out. (Vivien Schweitzer) * 'DON CARLO' (Monday and Thursday) James Levine will be in the pit when Verdi's noble masterpiece returns to the Met in John Dexter's production.

At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini) 'IDOMENEO' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) In place of the dramatic tenor Ben Heppner, the clarion-voiced tenor Kobie van Rensburg takes over the title role in Mozart's noble opera seria ''Idomeneo,'' which has returned to the company's roster in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's highly stylized and effective 1982 production. There are two other cast changes: the elegant mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena sings Idamante, and the bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties sings the volatile Elettra. Best of all, Dorothea R\u00f6schmann, a superb soprano, returns as Ilia. James Levine conducts. Tomorrow at 1 p.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220 tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini) 'LORD BYRON'S LOVE LETTER'/'THE VILLAGE SINGER' (Wednesday) The operatization of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' by Andr\u00e9 Previn might have obscured the fact that Tennessee Williams did write a single opera libretto of his own. It's ''Lord Byron's Love Letter,'' set by the composer Raffaello de Banfield, first performed in 1955 and nearly forgotten since. Now the Manhattan School of Music Opera Theater continues its cultivation of neglected American opera by bringing the work (which is about, what else, dotty old Southern ladies) back for its New York premiere, on a double bill with Stephen Paulus's ''Village Singer.'' Ari Pelto conducts. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (917) 493-4428, msmnyc.edu; $20; $10 for students and 65+.

(Midgette) 'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) Andrea Gruber is a soprano who flings herself into roles; accordingly, she takes on her first Tosca with a certain violence. The character becomes tough yet vulnerable in her reading, yet the vulnerability is perhaps too pronounced in her uneven, patchy singing. She resumes the role for the season's final performance tomorrow, paired with the Cavaradossi of Walter Fraccaro and the Met's perennial Scarpia these days, James Morris. The real news is the conductor Nicola Luisotti in his first Met season, who conducts the piece as if it mattered. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220. (Midgette) Classical Music * AMSTERDAM BAROQUE ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Ton Koopman leads his period instrument orchestra and choir, along with a slate of vocal soloists (Lisa Larsson, soprano; Bogna Bartosz, alto; J\u00f6rg D\u00fcrm\u00fcller, tenor; and Klaus Mertens, bass) in a program that includes Magnificat settings by Bach and Buxtehude; Bach's ''Jauchzet, frohlocket, auf preiset die Tage,'' from the ''Christmas Oratorio''; and Corelli's ''Christmas'' Concerto Grosso in G minor.

Now, with their new CD, ''Gloryland,'' they are continuing the exploration of traditional American folk music they began with ''American Angels.'' On Thursday the women will be joined by Darol Anger, a violinist and mandolinist, and Scott Nygaard, a guitarist, for a program titled ''Long Time Traveling,'' featuring folk songs, shape-note tunes and gospel hymns. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $35 in advance, $40 at the door. (Schweitzer) * BANG ON A CAN ALL-STARS (Tuesday) The freewheeling performing arm of the Bang on a Can new-music empire -- well, small empire, anyway -- offers a program that moves through the increasingly porous boundaries between contemporary classical music, rock and jazz. Included are works by Fred Frith, Martin Bresnick, Julia Wolfe, Conlon Nancarrow, Thurston Moore and Don Byron. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $35. (Kozinn) STEPHANIE BLYTHE (Thursday) This American mezzo-soprano sings lots of Brahms, some delicious Duparc and a little Falla too. Warren Jones is the pianist.

At 6:30 and 8:30 p.m., (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $60. (Kozinn) * ELIOT FISK AND THE MIR\u00d3 QUARTET (Tonight) Mr. Fisk plays guitar with energy, intensity and precision, qualities that the Mir\u00f3 players are likely to match in this program of Spanish music. Included are Arriaga's String Quartet No. 3, Leonardo Balada's Caprichos No. 2 and Boccherini's Quintet No. 4 for guitar and strings, best known for its zesty fandango. Mr. Fisk will also play some solo guitar music. At 7, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $45. (Kozinn) JUAN DIEGO FL\u00d3REZ (Tonight) The darling of the Metropolitan Opera these days, this Peruvian tenor is making a Carnegie Hall recital debut that Carnegie Hall, interestingly, is not presenting. Mr. Fl\u00f3rez's voice can be a little bleaty for some tastes, but it's always thoughtfully, carefully produced, with clean coloratura and excellent musicianship. His program includes Mozart, Faur\u00e9, Massenet, Bizet, Rosa Mercedes Ayala de Morales, Donizetti and, of course, Rossini, his signature composer. At 8, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $95. (Midgette) JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Monday) James DePreist conducts his Juilliard hotshots in Berlioz, Mozart and Ravel.

(Tommasini) * ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) The conductorless Orpheus Chamber Orchestra kicks off its just announced ''New Brandenburgs'' commissioning project at Carnegie Hall. Six composers have been invited to write orchestra concertos inspired by Bach's ''Brandenburgs.'' Stephen Hartke, the arresting California-based composer, starts things off with ''A Brandenburg Autumn,'' which will receive its premiere on this program, alongside, naturally, three Bach concertos: the ''Brandenburgs'' Nos. 1 and 2, and the Keyboard Concerto in D minor with the pianist Jeremy Denk.

(Dunning) ARTHUR AVILES TYPICAL THEATER (Tonight) Mr. Aviles celebrates the 10th anniversary of his vibrant, category-defying company with a new piece, ''Ear to the Ground.'' It is drawn from what was heard and felt by the choreographer and his dancers in the ground rumblings emanating from ''the concrete of the South Bronx, the floor of the dance studio, the common ground of social realities'' and other terrains, as Mr. Aviles puts it. At 8 p.m., Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, 841 Barretto Street, near Garrison Avenue, Hunts Point, (718) 842-5223, or bronxacademyofartsanddance.org; $15 and $20.

(Through Dec. 9.) Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, or thekitchen.org. Tickets: $12. (Dunning) RISA JAROSLOW & DANCERS (Tonight through Sunday night) Risa Jaroslow has often focused on the idea of community in her work, and in ''Resist/Surrender'' she explores ideas about masculinity by bringing in a diverse group of nondancers (gay teenagers, New York City firefighters and corporate lawyers) to work with her troupe. Scott Johnson has composed an original score. At 8:30, Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $15; members, $10. (Roslyn Sulcas) * BILL T. JONES/ARNIE ZANE DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday through Thursday) That raggedly handsome old structure you pass on the way to Aaron Davis Hall is now a handsome new theater called the Gatehouse, and Bill T. Jones has created ''Chapel/Chapter'' for it. Daniel Bernard Roumain has contributed the score, drawn from sacred and secular Renaissance music and gospel and folk. It includes video by Janet Wong and scenic design by Bjorn Amelan. (Through Dec. 9.) Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., the Gatehouse, 150 Convent Avenue, at 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 650-7100, aarondavishall.org; $150 for the opening gala; $25 for all other performances. (Dunning) KNUA DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday) This South Korean dance company, whose name is the acronym for the Korean National University of the Arts, will make its New York City debut in a program that includes choreography by Hyun Ja Kim, Mina Yoo, Balanchine (''Allegro Brillante'') and Petipa (the pas de deux from ''Diana and Acteon''). At 7 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 220-1460, tribecapac.org; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * LUIS LARA MALVAC\u00cdAS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Twenty-one short sections make up ''There Is No Such Thing,'' a new work from this talented Venezuelan choreographer, who tends to approach dance as visual art, and whose work can sometimes seem as much installation as performance. At 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6500, dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, artists and 65+. (Sulcas) Movement Research at the Judson Church (Monday) Nothing goes with exorbitant holiday spending like free experimental dance. This week, check out works in progress by Jennifer Monson, Kathy Westwater and Regina Rocke. At 8 p.m., 55 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 598-0551, movementresearch.org. (La Rocco) * MOVEMENT RESEARCH IMPROVISATION FESTIVAL (Friday) This is less a showcase than a freewheeling exploration of the art of physical improvisation, with a roster of strongly individual performers and curators. (Through Dec. 10.) At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $12. (Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker'' continues until Dec. 30, with eight performances this week alone. It may be hard on its rotating casts of dancers, not to speak of the orchestra and the stagehands, but it's magic for the audience. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m., Tuesday though Thursday at 6 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or (212) 721-6500, nycballet.com; $15 to $110. (Rockwell) The Parsons Dance Company (Tuesday through Thursday) David Parsons brings his high-energy company to the Joyce with two programs performed over a two-week period. Highlights include ''The Nascimento Project,'' a new collaboration with the Brazilian musician Milton Nascimento; a revival of ''Ring Around the Rosie,'' last seen in New York more than a decade ago; and ''In the End,'' set to music by the Dave Matthews Band. (Through Dec. 17.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $42. (La Rocco) * STREB S.L.A.M. (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Streb and her fearless (we hope) high-flying, hard-crashing performers will present a new show, ''Streb SLAM 8: Extreme Action,'' complete with popcorn and cotton candy.

(Dunning) 'TRIBUTE TO BUTOH II' (Tonight and tomorrow night) This series, a homage to the Butoh artist Kazuo Ohno on his 100th birthday, continues with dances by Tanya Calamoneri, Leigh Evans, Mana Hashimoto and Akiko Bo Nishijima. At 8, CRS Center, 123 Fourth Avenue, at 12th Street, East Village, (212) 677-8621; $15; $10 for students. (Dunning) JOHANNES WIELAND (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Wieland, known for his stylish, sleekly hard-charging modern-dance choreography, will present ''Progressive Coma,'' a new multimedia piece about the power of images in the media. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 7 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $20. (Dunning) ZENDORA DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday night) Nancy Zendora celebrates 45 years in dance with a program of solos and duets that includes two signature pieces, ''Shadows and Other Ancestors'' and ''The Descent.'' At 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning) PAVEL ZUSTIAK (Thursday) Hold the holiday cheer. Mr. Zustiak and his dance company, Palissimo, will present ''Le Petit Mort/Now It's Time to Say Goodbye,'' which he describes as a ''postmortem ecstasy somewhere between a dream and a memory.'' Tal Yarden has contributed the video component of this multimedia work. (Through Dec. 10.) At 8 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'RON MUECK,' through Feb. 4. So intensely lifelike are the fiberglass and silicone human figures made by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck that you might almost converse with them. Ranging in size from an infant that is 10 and a quarter inches high to a woman in bed more than 21 feet long, they seem to embody, in one way or another, the perils and challenges of the human condition. The most affecting are ''Dead Dad,'' a 40-inch rendering of the artist's father as a nude corpse, and ''Man in a Boat,'' in which a man a little more than two feet high sits naked and hapless toward the prow of a life-size rowboat. But Mr. Mueck stumbles when he gets into really exaggerated scale. The subject has not earned its monumentality, and its size distracts from its emotional intensity. Still, there are moments when you almost believe his subjects have lives. 200 Eastern Parkway at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, all produced since the early 1990s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images you merely sense that some horrible violence has occurred, or is about to happen. Though wonderfully lucid and dramatic, the moralizing of these images can become a little tedious. But this popular artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. (See above.) (Benjamin Genocchio) * Frick Collection: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 28. This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Vel\u00e1zquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Smith) * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is spectacularly grand and avoids the familiar piety of the standard masterpiece potpourri by virtue of its eloquent installation in the museum's loopy ramp. It's carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Vel\u00e1zquezes and Zurbar\u00e1ns and El Grecos and Riberas and Dal\u00eds and Picassos, many famous, many not. The show's big point, which has the simple virtue of being self-evident, is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith) * Museum of Modern Art: 'Manet and the Execution of Maximilian,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded by a prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Holland Cotter) * NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck) New-York Historical Society: 'New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War,' through Sept. 3. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society's multi-year exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Edward Rothstein) P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'John Latham: Time Base and the Universe,' through Jan. 8. This retrospective of John Latham, who died this year at 84, suggests a series of nesting time capsules. It spans nearly 50 years of Mr. Latham's work, which is concerned with time, preservation and decay. Among the more idiosyncratic and interesting pieces are a series of ''Cluster'' sculptures from the early 1990s, orbs of plaster embedded with books and suspended from the ceiling, which suggest cultural detritus preserved in celestial rock or geological magma. ''The N-U Niddrie Heart'' (around 1990), in which ''The Pregnancy Survival Manual'' and ''Vanished Species'' are cut up and fitted into glass armatures, with sand scattered around their bases, explores human production (and reproduction) and the passage of time. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Martha Schwendener) Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for the stealth-potency of this modest-size, first-time United States survey of original designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense,the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugar-coating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) * UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,' through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art -- Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter -- were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists, including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck) * The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,' through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: Kiki Smith: 'A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in ''Kiki Smith'': men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea Fred W. McDarrah: 'Artists and Writers of the 60s and 70s' This show of more than 100 photographs by the former Village Voice photographer and picture editor Fred W. McDarrah opens with a shot of Jack Kerouac and some frolicsome women at a 1958 New Year's Eve bash. It is hastily grabbed and opportunistic, like much of Mr. McDarrah's work, for he operated independently, rarely working on assignment. There are groupings of artists in their studios (Alice Neel, Philip Guston, Jasper Johns); actors (Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro on the set of ''Taxi Driver''); and musicians (Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan). Mr. McDarrah's best-known image may be his 1965 close-up of Bob Dylan, dressed all in black and saluting, his countenance as earnest as that of a battle-hardened marine. It is an enduring symbol of the era's antiwar protests, rebellion and counterculture. Steven Kasher Gallery521 West 23rd Street, (212) 966-3978, stevenkasher.com, through Jan. 5. (Genocchio) Other Galleries * 'Political Cartoons from Nigeria' Most of the drawn and painted images here are single-panel lampoons of past and present social inequity and corruption in Nigeria. Nearly all are by Ghariokwu Lemi, famous for his 26 superb, incident-filled album covers for Fela Kuti. For the occasion, the artist introduces two younger colleagues, Comfort Jacobs and Lordwealth Ololade, to New York. Without at all resembling him in style, they follow his sharp commentarial lead. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, through Dec. 17. (Cotter) Last Chance STEVE MUMFORD: 'THE WAR IN IRAQ' This exhibition of paintings is based on Mr. Mumford's field drawings and sketches done in four trips to Iraq from April 2003 to October 2004. His paintings function differently from news photographs and television images -- they are not so mediated, which is one reason, perhaps, that they are so arresting. Postmasters Gallery, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727 3323 or www.postmastersart.com; closes tomorrow.
