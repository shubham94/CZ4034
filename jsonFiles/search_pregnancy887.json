Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. 'ELVIS PEOPLE' In previews; opens on Thursday.

'EURYDICE' In previews; opens on Monday. The hot young playwright Sarah Ruhl (''The Clean House'') gives her spin on the classic myth of Orpheus and Eurydice (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. 'FALSETTOLAND' In previews; opens on Sunday. The National Asian-American Theater company brings back its revival of William Finn's musical about a gay man trying to deal with his wife, his lover and the approaching bar mitzvah of his son (1:40). Dimson Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: THE ROAST OF UTOPIA' Through Aug 22. The master parodists return with an excellent title and new jokes at the expense of ''Spring Awakening,'' ''Mary Poppins'' and other shows (1:30). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'GONE MISSING' In previews; opens on June 24. The Civilians revive this play with music; based on interviews, it revolves around the theme of loss (1:30).

The Roundabout presents a new revival of John Van Druten's drawing room comedy about two childhood friends who grow up to be very different adults (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. 'RADIO' In previews; opens on Sunday.

'ROMEO AND JULIET' In previews; opens on June 24. Oscar Isaac and Lauren Ambrose play the star-crossed lovers in this new Shakespeare in the Park production. Michael Greif (''Rent'') directs. Delacorte Theater in Central Park, midpark at 80th Street, (212) 539-8750. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' (Tony Award, best revival of a musical 2007) Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Ra\u00fal Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' (Tony Award, best musical 2007) Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'CRAZY MARY' Sigourney Weaver and Kristine Nielsen serve their specialties (WASP tartness, madcap madness) with such gusto in A. R. Gurney's comedy that it feels ungallant to point out that their characters are as artificial as hard-plastic dolls. A contrived play that never quite connects its thoughtful mind with its sentimental heart (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'ELECTRA' An ''adaptation'' of Sophocles' play that is more of a spoof of a Greek tragedy than any serious attempt to revive one (1:10). The HAS Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, at 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 868-4444.(Wilborn Hampton) ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATER MARATHON 2007: SERIES A Neil LaBute's contemporary gloss on a classic tale of Greek vengeance is the highlight of the first round in this annual series of short plays. Dana Delany and Victor Slezak are woman scorned and cad of a hubby in a gruesome drama that packs a visceral punch. Unfortunately, Mr. LaBute's play comes last in a mostly unrewarding program (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'ESCAPE FROM BELLEVUE' This showcase for the band the Knockout Drops is less a theatrical experience than a slightly uncomfortable hybrid of a stand-up routine and a rock concert. It is also the agreeable if predictable memoir of the lead singer, Christopher John Campion, who narrates his own story -- heavy substance abuse, a couple of trips to Bellevue, a brave new life -- with a knack for anecdote and an ear for dialogue, like a particularly good storyteller at the corner bar. But ultimately, a rock musical, even one as understated as this, rises or falls with its music; fortunately, this band, though a little stolid, is pretty good (1:30). The Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, (212) 307-7171. (Anne Midgette) 'FROM RIVERDALE TO RIVERHEAD' Like a spinoff of the ''Saturday Night Live'' skit ''Bronx Beat,'' three strident, shallow sisters dominate this road play by Anastasia Traina, which repeatedly strikes the notes of a comedy skit but steadily increases the volume to an uncomfortable level of cruelty. Louise (Angelica Torn), her sisters and her luminous and quirky daughter, Rosie (Bess Rous), are driving to visit Louise's son in prison, enduring Louise's loud outbursts of self-pity that escalate into hysteria and abuse. The whole play focuses on these four women in the car, evoking the ''Are we there yet?'' of a family trip until it finally, in every sense, veers off the road (2:00). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-4500. (Midgette) 'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clich\u00e9d feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Ginia Bellafante) 'HORIZON' God is in the curriculum in Rinde Eckert's lively portrait of a theologian, an homage to the ''Christian realism'' of Reinhold Niebuhr. But even the fiercest secularist should find pleasure in this engaging performance piece, set in the seminary-without-walls of one man's mind (1:25). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-8996. (Brantley) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'IN A DARK DARK HOUSE' Neil LaBute's latest work, a tale of two badly behaving brothers (played by Frederick Weller and Ron Livingston), is about American adolescence and how it is warped, stolen and willfully extended. Before the double-knotted plot twists take over, it's a cold-eyed, absorbing drama that testifies to its author's very real talents (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'PASSING STRANGE' The composer and performer Stew narrates this semiautobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the Los Angeles-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) * 'THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL' The Mint Theater Company has unearthed this enthralling Edwardian drama by St. John Hankin about a lazy charmer who returns home to blackmail his wealthy family (2:00). The Mint Theater Company, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Jason Zinoman) * 'THE RULES OF CHARITY' A man with cerebral palsy and the daughter who cares for him are at the center of this scalding play by John Belluso, which hits none of the familiar notes of the works-about-the-disabled genre but many thought-provoking ones. The performances, by the troupe Theater by the Blind, stick with you, along with the unsettling ideas of the play (2:00). Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'the house of bernarda alba' A first-rate revival in an adaptation that is somewhat abbreviated but maintains the play's tragic claustrophobia. A fine cast that includes a 12-member chorus that dances the flamenco (1:40). Nagelberg Theater, Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Hampton) 'TIME FLIES AND OTHERS BY IVES' An amusing collection of comic playlets by David Ives embraces the little guy (1:35). Laurie Beechman Theater, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40).

(Brantley) 'TEA' Age-blind casting is a great strength of the Pan Asian Repertory Theater's production of this play about four Japanese war brides who gather in 1968 to clean up the house of a fifth, who has killed herself. But the play itself crams verbiage and melodrama into what feels like a television epic, complete with that most stereotypical of figures, the dead woman's ghost seeking liberation into the next world. The whole thing goes down like a long soap opera, though the actresses do their best to bring it all to life (1:30). West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday.

'AMU' (No rating, 102 minutes, in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi) This ambitious first feature by Shonali Bose, about Kaju, a young Indian-American woman searching for the real India and for her roots, begins as a gentle comedy of cultures clashing. Its true topic, though, is the riots that broke out in Delhi in 1984 after Indira Gandhi's assassination. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and as Kaju learns, justice has been delayed and denied. (Rachel Saltz) * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'THE BOSS OF IT ALL' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Danish) To describe ''The Boss of It All,'' Lars von Trier's acidic corporate comedy, as '' 'The Office' viewed through the looking glass'' only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. (Stephen Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt this film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, its story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden) 'BUG' (R, 102 minutes) In this overwrought psychodrama from the director William Friedkin, Ashley Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a shaky Oklahoma barmaid, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon) who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere. Though the movie's escalating hysteria may strain credulity, Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'CHALK' (PG-13, 105 minutes) This loose-jointed ensemble mockumentary about high school teachers is funny in a squirm-inducing way. (Holden) 'CRAZY LOVE' (PG-13, 92 minutes) Love is blind, and so too is Linda Pugach, one of the loony-tuners in Dan Klores's somewhat sickening, mildly gonzo documentary. In 1959 Mrs. Pugach, then 22 and known as Linda Riss, was blinded by her husband-to-be Burton Pugach, a Bronx ambulance chaser who single-mindedly pursued the object of his obsession all the way to the marriage altar. (Dargis) 'DAY WATCH' (R, 140 minutes, in Russian) Picking up a number of years after ''Night Watch'' concludes, this second installment in Timur Bekmambetov's bustling supernatural trilogy dazzles and confuses with equal determination. Less coherent than its predecessor, if equally creative, the movie depicts hidden dimensions teeming with beings who swap bodies at will and rewrite destiny with something called the Chalk of Fate. Perhaps the Fickle Finger was otherwise engaged. (Catsoulis) * 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis) 'HOSTEL: PART II' (R, 94 minutes) A trio of American female students are brutalized and butchered by the rich and twisted in Eli Roth's follow-up to his generally odious ''Hostel.'' Both installments are driven by the same low motivation: to push the boundaries of exploitative nastiness. (Laura Kern) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) * 'KNOCKED UP' (R, 129 minutes) Foul of mouth and true of heart, this new comedy from Judd Apatow (''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'') captures the sexual and moral confusion of the present moment remarkably well. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are unlikely bedfellows but perfect comic foils as a shlub-babe couple whose one-night stand leans to an unintended but not unwelcome pregnancy. (Scott) 'MR. BROOKS' (R, 120 minutes) Kevin Costner and William Hurt camp it up as a serial killer and his demonic alter ego in ''Mr. Brooks,'' a werewolf movie masquerading as a sophisticated thriller. (Holden) * 'OCEAN'S THIRTEEN' (PG-13, 113 minutes) The gang's all here, looking fighting trim and Hollywood beautiful, at your disposable pleasure. Steven Soderbergh shoots and directs, while George, Brad and the rest hustle and flow. (Dargis) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) * 'PAPRIKA' (R, 90 minutes, in Japanese) In this gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close. Satoshi Kon's mind-twisting, eye-tickling anim\u00e9 isn't greasy kid's stuff: it's for thinking, interested adults whose sense of wonder remains as alive as their imaginations. (Dargis) * 'PIERREPOINT: THE LAST HANGMAN' (R, 90 minutes) In this meditation on capital punishment and culpability, Timothy Spall, British film's quintessential blundering bloke, sinks his teeth into one of the juiciest roles of his career. His character, Albert Pierrepoint, a once-celebrated English hangman, executed more than 600 people (including 200 Nazi war criminals) from the early 1930s to the mid-1950s. (Holden) 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'SURF'S UP' (PG, 90 minutes) Treading eagerly on the flippers of last year's ''Happy Feet'' comes this ho-hum, computer-animated comedy featuring birds on boards. As a young Rockhopper penguin (voiced by Shia LaBeouf) heads for his first professional surfing competition, he learns about love, perseverance and that winning isn't everything. Though infused with a friendly, blue-collar vibe, the movie suggests that a moratorium on penguins might be called for -- despite the inevitable anthropomorphic void. (Catsoulis) * 'TEN CANOES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in various Yolngu Aboriginal dialects) There is nothing more enthralling than a good yarn, and the mesmerizing ''Ten Canoes'' interweaves two versions of the same Australian Aboriginal fable, one filmed in black and white and set a thousand years ago and an even older one, filmed in color and set in prehistoric times. (Holden) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) Film Series TO SAVE AND PROJECT: THE FIFTH MoMA INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF FILM PRESERVATION (Today through Monday) This richly varied series of films recently restored by the Museum of Modern Art and other members of the International Federation of Film Archives comes to an end this weekend, but there are still some remarkable things to see: The 1942 film ''A Pilot Returns'' (Friday) is one of the propaganda films made for Mussolini's government by Roberto Rossellini, whose politics changed abruptly (''Open City'') at the war's end; August Blom's ''End of the World'' (Saturday) is an apocalyptic thriller made in Denmark in 1916; ''A Man There Was'' (Saturday) is a 1917 feature by Sweden's first major filmmaker, Victor Sjostrom. Sunday brings a double feature of experimental films by Hollis Frampton, ''Zorns Lemma'' and ''Winter Solstice,'' as preserved by MoMA. The festival ends on Monday with Noel Black's cult favorite ''Pretty Poison''; ''Mata Hari,'' a 1931 George Fitzmaurice film featuring Greta Garbo's sexiest pre-code performance; and Otto Preminger's dark and stately 1947 melodrama, ''Daisy Kenyon,'' with Joan Crawford and Henry Fonda. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) THREE BY JAMES BENNING (Today through Thursday) Nothing seems more ordinary than the notion of a landscape photographer, but a landscape filmmaker is something exceptional -- which is just what James Benning is. His work discovers movement and change where others have for so long seen stasis and permanence. The Anthology Film Archives will be screening three of Mr. Benning's recent films in rotation this week, beginning tonight with ''13 Lakes'' and ''Ten Skies'' (both made in 2004), and adding ''One Way Boogie Woogie/27 Years Later,'' a 2005 revisitation of Mr. Benning's celebrated 1977 film ''One Way Boogie Woogie.'' Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. LILY ALLEN (Sunday) A 22-year-old British singer with deceptively sweet, ska-infused pop songs, Ms. Allen is at her wry and snarky best when putting down disagreeable suitors. ''Smile,'' a No. 1 hit in England, is pure schadenfreude, and ''Knock 'Em Out'' a catalog of snappy answers to bad pickup lines: ''I've got herpes. No, I've got syphilis.'' At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $25. (Ben Sisario) APOSTLE OF HUSTLE, MEMPHIS (Tomorrow and Monday) More evidence that Canada might have more side projects than actual bands: Apostle of Hustle, featuring Andrew Whiteman of Broken Social Scene, plays dreamy washes of guitar over an easygoing rock pulse, recalling the soft points of U2's ''Unforgettable Fire.'' Memphis includes Torquil Campbell of Stars, the superbly urbane indie-cabaret band from Toronto, whose songs are evoked but not equaled by Memphis's delicate melodies and cool dissection of heartbreak. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $10. Monday at 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. (Sisario) * BRAKESBRAKESBRAKES, PELA (Tonight through Sunday) Led by the snarlingly persistent Eamon Hamilton, Brakesbrakesbrakes packs a lifetime of resentment into a taut two-minute power-pop song and turns to wistful country-folk to simmer down. (The band is known simply as Brakes back home in England, but uses the unwieldy triplicate here to distinguish itself from another band named Brakes.) Pela, from Brooklyn, calls its style ''pastoral punk,'' which means wide-open skies of bouncy, Pixiesesque basslines and sharp, sparkling guitars. With Electric Soft Parade. Tonight at 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $14. Tomorrow at 9 p.m. and Sunday at 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario) FAB FAUX (Tuesday and Wednesday) There are Beatles tribute acts, and then there are Beatles tribute acts. This one, featuring the bassist Will Lee (of the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' band) and the guitarist Jimmy Vivino (from ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien''), recreates even the most complex studio work of the later Beatles without breaking a sweat. These two concerts are billed as a full-career Beatles survey: ''From the Cavern to the Rooftop.'' At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight and tomorrow night) In the final two performances of ''Celebrating Bobby Short,'' Mr. Feinstein's funny, touching, meticulously researched tribute to this cabaret legend, who died two years ago, his special guests are Barbara Carroll (tonight) and Charles Cochran (tomorrow). This is the jazziest show of Mr. Feinstein's career, and he confidently stands his ground. At 8:30 and 11, Feinstein's at Loews Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover, with a $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden) ALBERT HAMMOND JR. (Monday) The sunshine of ''Yours to Keep'' (Scratchie/New Line), the debut solo album by Mr. Hammond, of the Strokes, shows that crisp guitar classicism need not exist solely in the dark behind Manhattan's velvet ropes. With the Dead Trees and Medium Cool. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sisario) * YUKA HONDA (Tomorrow) The keyboardist half of the fondly remembered 1990s avant-pop duo Cibo Matto -- who sang kitschy and hilarious confections about the infinite bounty of junk food -- Yuka Honda has kept busy as a solo artist and collaborator. Tomorrow, in a show presented by Tonic, she unveils a new project with Petra Haden, whose own ambitions include an a cappella cover of the Who's album ''The Who Sell Out.'' Also on hand: Sean Lennon, Cyro Baptista and DJ Olive. At 8 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, abronsartscenter.org or tonicnyc.com; $15. (Sisario) LYLE LOVETT, K. D. LANG (Thursday) Lyle Lovett uses the ache in his voice to sound utterly heartfelt even when his songs grow wry and absurd, while his limber band covers the Texas spectrum from swing to honky-tonk to gospel. K. D. Lang's big, sultry voice harks back to a bygone era, when pop and country singers knew how to linger over a song's melody. But in the material she writes and chooses, she has a postmodern self-consciousness, embracing lavish emotions without giving in to them entirely. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $45.50 to $101. (Jon Pareles) MASCOTT (Tuesday) If Aimee Mann had fended off cynicism, she might sound like Kendall Meade, the songwriter and singer of Mascott. Ms. Meade's serenely tuneful songs turn folk-rock into stately pop, wrapping vulnerability and longing in quietly radiant arrangements. With Graham Smith, Ghosts I've Met and Twin Thousands. At 8 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. (Pareles) MIDSUMMER NIGHT SWING (Tuesday through Thursday) Lincoln Center's annual outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing opens on Tuesday with George Gee's Make Believe Ballroom Orchestra and David Berger's Sultans of Swing recreating ''The Count Meets the Duke,'' the 1961 ''duel'' between Count Basie and Duke Ellington. On Wednesday is Charanga Soleil, which mixes salsa with Congolese guitar rumba and Haitian rara drumming; Thursday is a disco party for Gay Pride Week, with Jai Rodriguez as the host. At 7:30 p.m., with dance lessons at 6:30 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza, Columbus Avenue at 63rd Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $15. (Sisario) * MIKA (Tonight) A 23-year-old British singer driven ''identity mad'' by his pop-culture obsessions -- ''I tried to be Grace Kelly/But all her looks were too sad'' -- Mika aims for the glittery pop bombast of Elton John and Queen, and has the gumption to pull it off. With Sara Bareilles. At 8, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) O'DEATH (Tonight) This raw and ragged New York band draws from the starkness and spiritual purity of Appalachian folk, the menace of punk and the rowdy theatricality of Tom Waits, jumbling sacred and profane. Tonight O'Death celebrates the re-release of its album ''Head Home'' (Ernest Jenning). With the Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band and the Super Monster. At 8, Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $12. (Sisario) * ONEIDA (Tonight and tomorrow night) Things are best in Oneida songs when the patterns of drums, keyboards and guitar converge into powerful, pulsating drones that seem to summon some primordial rock energy. And though this veteran Brooklyn band's latest album, ''Happy New Year'' (Jagjaguwar), also toys with some medieval-ish folk, there is plenty of that eerie, cathartic blare. Tonight at 8, with Dirty Faces, Brass Castle, Repellent and others, at Trash Bar, 256 Grand Street, at Roebling Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn (718) 599-1000, thetrashbar.com; $7. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; free. (Sisario) * PANDA BEAR (Monday) Noah Lennox, better known as Panda Bear, is one of the singers and captains of disorientation in Animal Collective. In that band and on his recent solo album, ''Person Pitch'' (Paw Tracks), he sends the sunniest Beach Boys melodies through endless psychedelic transformations, sometimes elegant and sometimes terrifying. With Rusty Santos and Kria Brekken. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) MACEO PARKER (Sunday) As the alto saxophonist for James Brown in his prime funk years and later for George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic, Mr. Parker has an impeccable pedigree and the skills to match. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35 in advance, $37 at the door. (Sisario) PEACHES (Wednesday) For Peaches, a former Canadian schoolteacher who became the uninhibited queen of electroclash, sex is everything: liberating force, political stage, social equalizer. Rap-singing over sparse, nervy electronic beats, she is a dance-floor dominatrix who demands pleasure, and demands it her way. (''Just one thing I can't compromise/I want to see you work it guy-on-guy.'') ''Guests'' are promised; expect them to end up entangled with their host in one way or another. At 10 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario) MADELEINE PEYROUX, JOSH RITTER (Tomorrow) Like Norah Jones, Ms. Peyroux has become a star by pursuing a gentle and sophisticated, jazz-inflected style -- a jazz-folk halfway point between Billie Holiday and Patsy Cline -- that has no place in the mainstream music business but whose honesty and finesse has struck a chord. Also on the bill is Josh Ritter, a songwriter whose guileless, boy-next-door voice belies the depth and ambition of his songs, whether he is confessing a simple crush or following his thoughts on a long, Whitmanesque incantation. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; $35 to $65. (Sisario) A. R. RAHMAN (Tomorrow) Mr. Rahman became king of the Bollywood soundtrack in the 1990s with a candied, Westernized style that borrows some tricks from Andrew Lloyd Webber. No wonder, then, that Mr. Lloyd Webber looked to him to write the music for ''Bombay Dreams.'' At 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $35 to $300. (Sisario) IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION (Tonight) An eloquent wiseguy whose songs evoke Bob Dylan and Paul Westerberg, Mr. Reilly, a former bellhop and gravedigger from Chicago, has the kind of high-energy, hook-heavy folk-rock sound that turns every head in a bar, while his nasal vocals are unsparingly sardonic: ''The friends that you rely on are the train tracks that you lie on.'' With Band of Thieves and the New York Howl. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) BUFFY SAINTE-MARIE (Monday) This 1960s protest folker and longtime champion of American Indian rights will surely sing ''Now That the Buffalo's Gone'' and ''Until It's Time for You to Go,'' and maybe even ''Cod'ine,'' which became a garage-rock standard. But fans will wonder -- and maybe cringe at the thought -- that she will also do her best-known number: ''Up Where We Belong,'' the mawkish 1982 smash sung by Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes, which Ms. Sainte-Marie wrote with Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche, then her husband. With Krystle Warren. At 7:30 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $30. (Sisario) * TELEVISION, APPLES IN STEREO, DRAGONS OF ZYNTH (Tomorrow) The jam band of the CBGB era, Television proved that bare art-rock need not have any aesthetic limitations, as Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd's guitars wailed in spiky, sinuous counterpoint, and its songs mushroomed into free-form odysseys of melody and noise. Reunited a couple of times since the early '90s, the band doesn't play often enough, but tomorrow it headlines an afternoon at Central Park SummerStage, with Apples in Stereo, a band from Denver that plays power-pop in bright, primary colors; and Dragons of Zynth, which claims to have an ''auto-physio-psychic'' approach to noisemaking. At 3 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free. (Sisario) * RICHARD THOMPSON, OLLABELLE (Thursday) From his days as a guitar prodigy in Fairport Convention, Richard Thompson has set his musings on bitterness and romance to subtly virtuosic, Celtic-infused folk-rock. His new album, ''Sweet Warrior'' (Shout! Factory), dips into nuts-and-bolts '50s rock for a series of stark tableaus of a world in conflict, from spiteful exes to a terrified, death-haunted young soldier in Iraq. The vocal quintet Ollabelle worships blues, country and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes, playing traditional songs like ''John the Revelator'' and originals that connect them to classic roots-rock. At 7 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, brooklynx.org; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario) MARY TIMONY (Tonight) Mary Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces. At 8, with High Places and Eric Gaffney, at Death By Audio, 49 South Second Street, between Wythe and Kent Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; $8. (Pareles) TRUE COLORS TOUR (Monday) In the best girls'-night-out package tour to come along in years, Cyndi Lauper appears with Debbie Harry, Erasure and a couple of rowdier underground bands: the heavily mascara'd, cabaret-goth Dresden Dolls, and the Gossip, a trio that plays bare but potent blues-punk. Also on the bill: Rosie O'Donnell and Margaret Cho. At 7 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $51 to $205.50. (Sisario) * VOXTROT (Tonight) Like Morrissey or Ray Davies, Voxtrot's Ramesh Srivastava uses the small scale, tight script and jangly energy of the three-minute rock song -- as well as a fragile voice perfectly comfortable with its limitations -- to focus emotionally compelling character studies.

(Schweitzer) * St. Luke'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) ''Unleashed'' is the final program in the St. Luke's chamber festival celebrating female composers. The women here have dealt with the stigma of being female -- evidently still something of a handicap in a field that remains overwhelmingly male -- by blazing their own trails: their own kinds of music, their own kinds of career. Joan La Barbara, Julia Wolfe, Pamela Z and Eve Beglarian share the afternoon with a young composer named Erin Watson, whose ''Lullaby for Cy Twombly,'' commissioned for the festival, will have its first performance. Tomorrow at 2 p.m., Chelsea Art Museum, 556 West 22nd Street; Sunday at 3 p.m., Dia:Beacon, Beacon, N.Y., (212) 594-6100, oslmusic.org; $20.

(Dunning) DANCE THEATER OF HARLEM (Tomorrow and Sunday) A recent lecture-performance at the Guggenheim Museum revealed that the advanced students at this school will be ready to go once the company resumes performing after a long hiatus because of financial problems. They will perform here, along with children -- adorable, of course -- from all levels of training. At 5 p.m., Harlem Stage at Aaron Davis Hall, West 135th Street and Convent Avenue, (212) 650-7100, harlemstage.org; $25.

The program includes repertory dances, a work in progress and a conversation about finding the balance between being an artist and being a parent. At 8, Brooklyn Arts Exchange, 421 Fifth Avenue, at Eighth Street, Park Slope, (718) 832-0018, bax.org; $8 to $15.

Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays from noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays from noon to 8 p.m., New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, 111 Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-1630, nypl.org.

The season proper opens with the Georgians in the third act of Petipa's ''Don Quixote,'' George Balanchine's ''Mozartiana'' and Trey McIntyre's ''Second Before the Ground.'' Tomorrow at 6:30 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, George Carter Road, Becket, Mass., (413) 243-0745, jacobspillow.org; $58. (Dunning) KATHAK ENSEMBLE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Janaki Patrik and her company will present a Kathak dance travelogue that takes the audience from the form's origins in the Indian countryside to the royal courts of a Bollywood movie set. At 8, Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) VALENTINA KOZLOVA'S DANCE CONSERVATORY COMPANY (Tonight) This program includes a new piece by Margo Sappington and excerpts from ''The Pharaoh's Daughter'' and ''Raymonda.'' Many of the performers are Ms. Kozlova's students, though the dancers also include Reyneris Reyes of the Boston Ballet. But to watch these young dancers perform is to see solid, inspired training and the handing down of tradition in three dimensions. At 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $30; $20 for 65+ and children under 12. (Dunning) MIRO MAGLOIRE'S NEW CHAMBER BALLET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Magloire specializes in presenting dances, here created by himself and a guest choreographer, Constantine Baecher, that are intimately connected to their musical scores, which are performed live. At 8, City Center Studio 4, fourth floor, 130 West 56th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444; $20.

At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $25; $20 for students. (Dunning) JODy OBERFELDER (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Oberfelder, known for her acrobatic, high-energy dance mixed with glints of humor, will present her new ''Heavy Light,'' inspired by Horace Walpole's notion that life is a comedy for thinkers and a tragedy for those who feel, and ''The Title Comes Last,'' in which performers travel from a workaday world into ''a land of vibrancy.'' Take us with you. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 3 p.m., the Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.theflea.org; $20; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * OUT LIKE THAT! FESTIVAL (Thursday) The festival, which celebrates gay pride in the Bronx, opens with ''She's Got Moves,'' a program of dance by ''fierce, feisty, ferocious'' female choreographers who include Alethea Adsitt, Sharon Estacio and Faye Driscoll. (Through June 23.) At 8 p.m., the Bronx Academy of Art & Dance, 841 Barretto Street, South Bronx, (718) 842-5223, bronxacademyofartsanddance.org; $15. (Dunning) SENS/NO\u00c9MIE LaFRANCE (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. LaFrance, known for visually dramatic site-specific dance, will present performances of a work in progress called ''Rapture,'' in which dancers travel across stainless-steel roofs and walls in a response to the architectural design of Frank Gehry's Fisher Center. At 8 p.m., Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7900, fishercenter.bard.edu; free. (Dunning) STREB S.L.A.M.

(Dunning) * 33rd ANNUAL DANCE CRITICS' ASSOCiATION CONFERENCE (Tomorrow and Sunday) This year's topics -- Katherine Dunham and Lincoln Kirstein -- are of general interest, and the conference sessions, which include screenings of rare films and a lecture-demonstration of the Dunham technique, are open to the public. David Vaughan will be honored for his critical writing and service as an archivist to the Merce Cunningham Dance Foundation, with the award presented by Mr. Cunningham. Participants include Martin Duberman, Kirstein's recent biographer, and Robert Gottlieb, the editor and dance writer. Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, dancecritics.org. (Dunning) VISION FESTIVAL XII (Tuesday) The festival, whose goal is to promote collaborations between choreographers, musicians and visual artists, begins on Tuesday with a program featuring work by Marlies Yearby and Cooper-Moore. (Through June 24.) At 9:30 p.m., Angel Orensanz Foundation, 172 Norfolk Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (800) 838-3006, brownpapertickets.com; $35; $30 in advance. (Dunning) WORKS AND PROCESS AT THE GUGGENHEIM: PILOBOLUS AND INBAL PINTO (Monday) Pilobolus will perform repertory and excerpts from a new piece choreographed collaboratively by Pilobolus and Ms. Pinto, with Avshalom Pollak, who, like Ms. Pinto, is an Israeli choreographer.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,' through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from mostly yarn-sewn to the popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS:THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at C\u00e9zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'Richard Serra Sculpture: 40 Years,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Michael Kimmelman) MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Sept. 4. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody) Galleries: Uptown 'CONCEPTUAL PHOTOGRAPHY: 1964-1989' There are no surprising names in this intriguing show of one or two works by nearly 30 artists from several generations and countries. But the works themselves are often unusual, especially on the early end, as is the richness with which various subjects and techniques ricochet among them. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through June 23. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea Art & Language, Stephanie Brooks, Helen Mirra, Ian Wilson In a four-artist show that is, to say the least, spare, the Minimal-Conceptual veterans Art & Language and Ian Wilson join forces with the relative newcomers Stephanie Brooks and Helen Mirra. For the most part, Art & Language sets the terms, first with ''Index 003'' (1973), a kind of teaser about the impossibility of saying nothing, which reads in this context as a defense of the work on view. In addition, everyone else here takes lots of language into their art. Peter Blum Chelsea, 529 West 29th Street, (212) 244-6055, peterblumgallery.com, through June 23. (Smith) Kathe Burkhart: 'The Liz Taylor Series: Selections from 1983-2007' The term ''post-feminism'' gains significance when looking at Kathe Burkhart's ''Liz Taylor Series'' paintings. Unlike 1970s feminist artists, Ms. Burkhart doesn't just celebrate famous women; she inhabits one. Ms. Taylor serves as a doppelganger for the artist in paintings that combine movie stills and tabloid images with collaged elements and text. Only a few of the 125 paintings in the series appear here, but they demonstrate how feminism can be retooled for every generation. Alexander Gray Associates, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 399-2636, alexandergray.com, through June 23. (Schwendener) 'In Defense of Ardor' For most of the 2000s, art pundits have campaigned to replace kvetchy postmodernism with a New Sincerity. By why an either/or proposition? Can't irony be ardent? Can't ardor be critically self-aware? Can't passion and reason coexist? In this group show they often do. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 929-5959, bellwethergallery.com, through June 30. (Holland Cotter) Galleries: Other * MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: 'PREIS bilder' Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) * 'The Museum of Crime and the Museum of God' Put together by the writer Luc Sante from material from his own collection, this assemblage -- with holy cards and vintage mug shots; protective amulets and 1930s crime novels; photographs of murder scenes and of river baptisms -- is essentially about his life and makes a transfixing show. Apexart, 291 Church Street, between Walker and White Streets, TriBeCa, apexart.org, through June 23. (Cotter) 'The Price of Everything: Perspectives on the Art Market' Marcel Duchamp, who tried to redefine art as an active tool for thinking rather than a passive object of looking, hovers like a damaged angel over this think-piece of a group show organized by the 2006-7 Helena Rubenstein Curatorial Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program. The Art Gallery, City University of New York Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, gc.cuny.edu, through June 24. (Cotter) Christian Tomaszewski: 'On Chapels, Caves and Erotic Misery' The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film's ''fourth wall'' by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch's ''Blue Velvet.'' Installed in the SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the ''Blue Velvet'' angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters's ''Merzbau'' to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be over-reaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch's. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through July 29. (Schwendener) Last Chance * 'Beneath the Underdog' This ultra-cool, downtown-comes-uptown affair is one of the better gallery shows of the year. And full credit goes to its artist-curators, Nate Lowman and Adam McEwen. They've turned Gagosian's six-room space into a mini-museum of objects that speak of the base, the gross, the fallen, the ruined, the failed. A second show, ''Mafia (or One Unopened Packet of Cigarettes),'' is tucked inside. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, between 76th and 77th Streets, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) 'CROSSCURRENTS: DURER TO PICASSO' A show of prints and drawings that makes imaginative pairings of older works with those of 20th-century artists who are sometimes cued by their contemporaries as well as their ancestors. The evidence is keen in, for example, Hieronymus Bosch's ''Temptation of St. Anthony'' (1561), a fervidly drawn scene of grotesque beings and fantastic doings placed near two later Surrealist renditions: a biomorphic figment by Andre Masson, ''The Genius of the Species'' (1942), and Salvador Dal\u00ed's etching ''Landscape in the Manner of Arcimboldo'' (1934), a biomorphic-geometric vision. A beguiling show. David Tunick, 19 East 66th Street, (212) 570-0090, tunickart.com; closes today. (Grace Glueck) * LOUISE KRUGER: SCULPTURE, 1950s TO THE PRESENT This 21-work survey of mostly carved wood sculpture supplies another chunk in the history of postwar American art. Influenced by folk art and trained for a year by a shipbuilder, Ms. Kruger developed her art sculpture by cutting woodblocks for prints, as an enormous example here attests. Her life-size figures, portrait busts and political asides are in step with other artists of her generation, including Bill King and Marisol. But her works have their own formal quirks, telling abbreviations, lustrous finishes and quiet, watchful force. Lori Bookstein Fine Art, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 750-0949, loribooksteinfineart.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * JIM LEE: 'ALTAMONT' This young artist takes tips from lots of approved sources -- Robert Ryman, Richard Tuttle and Ellsworth -- but has some ideas of his own about the art and craft of building paintings and the play between the literal and the visual. The smaller works tend to be better because they are more complicated, but on the whole, and as a whole, the show is a beautiful start. Freight & Volume, 542 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-8700, volumegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) CLAUDE MONET (1840-1926): A TRIBUTE TO DANIEL WILDENSTEIN AND KATIA GRANOFF This exhibition of nearly 60 paintings by one of the most beloved painters in the world feels a little like having dinner with a celebrity. It allows you to experience afresh the momentum and innovations of Monet's astounding trajectory, up close and in detail. It should not be missed. Wildenstein & Company, 19 East 64th Street,(212) 879-0500, closes today. (Smith) NICK Z./KAI ALTHOFF: 'WE ARE BETTER FRIENDS FOR IT' The latest variation on the collaborative trashed-gallery convention is a strikingly beautiful, if funky, cavelike environment punctuated by artfully messy tableaus in stark white containers. These suggest crash pads, children's bedrooms and studios, but also function almost like paintings. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com; closes tomorrow.
