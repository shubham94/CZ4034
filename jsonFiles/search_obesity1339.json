Not often, if the population at large is typified by those residents of suburban New Rochelle in Westchester County who participated in a study made public yesterday. According to Dr. Kathy Bloomgarden, director of public issues research for Research and Forecasts, the research subsidiary of Ruder Finn & Rotman, a public relations firm, the study demonstrates that ''there is a weak link between people's knowledge of good health and their actual behavior, so that signals that we must better understand how to stimulate people to be involved in correct health practices.''

Those who are most concerned about nutrition, do not follow a more nutritionally sound diet than those who are less concerned.''", "snippet": "Americans may be well aware of the value of proper nutrition and regular exercise, but do they incorporate them into daily life?
