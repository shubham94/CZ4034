Museums * ''ALONG THE NILE: EARLY PHOTOGRAPHS OF EGYPT'' AND ''THE PHARAOH'S PHOTOGRAPHER: HARRY BURTON, TUTANKHAMEN AND THE METROPOLITAN'S EGYPTIAN EXPEDITION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 30). ''Along the Nile'' is a gem of an exhibition of early, mostly amateur photographs of Egypt, including Maxime Du Camp's famous view of the colossal, half-buried face of Ramses II with an assistant posing on top of the sculpture, the ancestor of all those shots of Mom and Uncle Burt squinting into the camera and smiling next to the Sphinx. The show includes obscure figures like Ernest Benecke, a French wool trader of German descent, whose images are more remarkable for seeming accidental and serendipitous, and Th\u00e9odule Dev\u00e9ria, whose photograph of the tomb of Ptahmose, the chief steward to Ramses II, is the only evidence of a site since reburied and lost beneath shifting sands. Pioneering works, these photographs have a virgin authenticity conveying the amateur photographer's amazement at seeing places through a device whose uncanny ability to capture those sights doubled the amazement. Half a century later Harry Burton photographed the excavation of Tutankhamen's tomb mixing Hollywood-style shots of Howard Carter uncovering Tut's mummy for the illustrated newspapers with documentary pictures made solely for the archives, which have an unintended modern beauty. The Burton show cleverly gives a fresh twist to the Tut craze, but the older photographs stick longer in the mind because they seem haunted from across a gulf of a century and a half.
