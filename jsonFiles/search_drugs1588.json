Specialists who study heart and kidney function are fascinated by what they have already learned about the hormone. It helps dispose of excess sodium in the blood and thus seems to play a role in regulating the amount of salt in the body. It appears to act as a counterbalance to other vital hormones in governing blood volume and pressure. It is present in large amounts in the blood of patients who suffer from congestive heart failure and certain kinds of abnormally fast, irregular heartbeats. In animal experiments even small amounts of the hormone gave powerful aid to the functioning of failing kidneys.", "headline": {"main": "WIDE EFFECTS OF HEART HORMONE ARE FOUND"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1714, "_id": "4fd1735b8eb7c8105d6678bc", "snippet": "THE revolutionary discovery of a hormone made by the human heart is scarcely two years old, but it has already spawned a whole new field of reseach as scientists begin to understand the substance's natural role and investigate ways of using it to...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/21/science/wide-effects-of-heart-hormone-are-found.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "HORMONES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BLOOD PRESSURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "KIDNEYS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By HAROLD M.
