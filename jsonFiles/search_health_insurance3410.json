Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The country's grief was both palpable and tangible. Americans responded by sending more than $40 million, trying to provide what succor they could to the families of the victims. None of the local charities had ever administered such sums before, so they learned as they went along. The Oklahoma City Community Foundation, which usually manages money donated for improving the city, quickly took the lead in coordinating the relief efforts. Now New York's charities face similar challenges and pitfalls, albeit on a much larger scale. In a recent interview, Nancy B. Anthony, the Oklahoma City foundation's executive director, was asked to recap some of her experiences in the Oklahoma disaster and explain what she had learned. Q. Why did your group wind up leading the relief effort in Oklahoma? A. We hadn't planned to. But banks, fraternal groups, civic do-gooders, everyone and their uncle wanted to set up a fund, and few of them understood how to qualify as a charity under I.R.S. rules. For example, they didn't realize that you can't just start writing out checks, you have to actually document needs. We distributed a memo explaining the rules. When people realized it took more than just collecting money, many asked us to set up their funds. By the end of two weeks, we were handling 10 funds, including the governor's and the mayor's. Q. How much money was collected for the relief effort? A. About $400,000 at first, but after a few months we were in the million-dollar area, as we inherited a lot more stand-alone funds. We eventually wound up administering about $15 million, more than a third of all the donations that came in. Q. Didn't the funds bridle at the idea that their contributions would be thrown into a big pot? Didn't they want credit for their donations, and a say in how their funds were spent? A. We didn't take money unless the funds gave us discretion to dispense it. And they had to realize that recipients didn't care who paid their medical bills, just that the bills were paid. But we spent the governor's and mayor's funds first, since the political officials were under pressure from the media to prove they were using the dollars they collected. After that, we identified donors in rotation -- if we made one grant in the name of the Rotary Club, the next one would be from the Kiwanis Club. Q. How did you set your priorities for spending the money? A. First, we let the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency folks deal with immediate emergency issues like travel expenses for family members. That bought us time to get organized. Also, about 60 percent of those killed worked for the federal government, and their families were eligible for federal relief. Many others had savings and family members who could help. So, we first dealt with those who needed immediate help paying utility bills and mortgages. And we coordinated with the Red Cross and other charities to set up a case manager system so that every family dealing with a death or critical injury was assigned someone trained in social work to be their advocate. At first, we thought that the social workers already working for the charities could handle that, but it didn't work. People who were trained to deal with chronic poverty or substance abuse weren't trained for this kind of work. So, we subcontracted some of the case management to people who were trained to assess a family's debts, to help them get death certificates, to navigate the system of benefits and issues specifically related to the Oklahoma City bombing. Q. How did you make sure that you and other charities weren't making duplicate grants, and that the recipients really were needy? A. We didn't just hand money to people, we paid their bills. When you are paying one electric or grocery bill at a time, you're not terribly concerned about fraud. Our bigger concern was getting people into counseling to get through the grieving process. And all of the relief organizations operated a joint database in which we shared data about people who were applying for help. The reason was to cut bureaucracy, so that if someone filled out the paperwork at the Salvation Army, they didn't have to fill it out again for us. But it also created an electronic file of who was getting what. The case managers, meanwhile, checked what needs were already being met by community groups. If a homebound elder was getting hot meals delivered before the bombing, he doesn't need more because his son died. Children who were already receiving Medicaid didn't need us to pick up medical costs. One man lost his wife and his car in the bombing. His church bought him a new car; we paid for the title and tax. Q. You faced criticism from the media on the way grants were disbursed. How did you handle that? A. We kept the money separate from the rest of our charitable funds. We never allocated any portion of our overhead to it, or deducted any administrative expenses from it. And we kept excellent records, so that we could verify how we used every penny. Q. Yet, the criticism kept coming. Why? A. Disgruntled people make great stories for the media. There's a culture of victimhood, made up of people whose identity as Victim of the Oklahoma City Bombing gave them an importance and visibility they never had before. Suddenly there'd be this story about some guy with four kids whose wife was killed, who couldn't pay his bills and who wasn't getting helped. In fact, we'd probably done a great deal for this guy, but we'd all agreed to keep our database totally confidential, so we couldn't respond. Also, people didn't understand what the money has to cover. People would hear about huge insurance settlements and such, and they'd think the money we collected was supposed to compensate the families of the 168 people who were killed. They forgot that these are funds to meet specific needs, not to compensate all victims for their loss. And they forgot that many of the survivors needed help, too. We paid medical bills for 83 people with serious injuries. One lady whose legs were crushed had a hospital bill of half a million dollars. Many of the survivors still have significant living and medical expenses, and huge mental health problems. There is a little boy who still has metal in his head, a man who still has glass in his body, others who were blinded. We have a staff person who still spends half her time working with families that are still emotionally dysfunctional. And we earmarked about $7 million for scholarship funds for any child whose parent was lost or disabled. We still have two-thirds of that money left, but even though it is not spent, it is committed. Q. So, even now, you're still administering money related to the bombing. Are you still collecting it? A. We stopped actively soliciting funds after a year, but money still comes in. For example, we still get checks from publishers who had earmarked a portion of the proceeds from books about the bombing. And remember, we do still have scholarships to pay out, and emotional counseling to do. But the actual bombing-related work is winding down. We knew our database of survivors wasn't year 2000 compliant, and would be wiped out at the beginning of that year. We did nothing to prevent that. The I.R.S. rules do say that, even if a donor earmarks funds for a particular use, the receiving charity can use the dollars in any way that is consistent with its stated mission. It would be completely legal for us to use extra money from the Oklahoma City bombing to provide relief to victims of the many tornados we have in this area. But it's probably not a good idea to do that when you're still asking people to give money for a specific need. The Red Cross is running into that in New York now. They've said they'll use some of the money they've collected to expand services related to other terrorist events. Maybe that makes sense in three years, if there's nothing that still needs doing in New York, but I'm not sure they should be doing this now. Q. Looking back, are there things you should have done differently? A. We should have relieved the pressure on our own people. They were working 12-hour days, and we should have made sure they took lunch breaks and time for diversion. Anger is a stage in the process of grieving, and sometimes, as unfair as it was, we became the object of that anger. We should have trained our own people to deal with that anger without getting angry back.", "headline": {"main": "Helping After Terror: Oklahoma City's Lessons", "kicker": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS"}, "abstract": "Interview with Nancy Anthony, executive director of Oklahoma City Community Foundation, who recaps her experiences distributing $40 million that Americans donated to victims of Oklahoma City bombing in 1995; photo (M)", "print_page": "18", "word_count": 1503, "_id": "4fd252708eb7c8105d7f8141", "snippet": "AT 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, a bomb killed 168 people at the Alfred P.

One of the stranger images left in my head from that terrible morning is of a woman standing on my corner in TriBeCa, laughing into her cellphone. Survivors, many of them coated head to foot with ash, were processing mutely up Church Street. My wife and I had run outside to determine whether we should evacuate the children from our apartment. And this nicely dressed woman was chatting with a friend as if New York were the same city it had been an hour earlier. Perhaps this was simply some kind of hysterical reaction. But I think that on that day, and for days afterward, all of us faced in varying degrees the difficulty of wrapping our minds around the magnitude of the murderous destruction visited on the place we live. For New York as a whole, disbelief and denial soon gave way to comprehension and grief. The uncountable dead were enumerated. Their killers acquired an identity. And in our public and personal ways, we mourned our losses. Some of us went to funerals and memorial services. Others joined impromptu wakes at firehouses around the city.
