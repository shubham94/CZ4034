Now scientists say the feeling is not only real, but they can show just what happens in the brain to cause it. Reporting in the current issue of the journal Science, Dr. Alexander Ploghaus and colleagues at Britain's Oxford University and in Canada said they hoped their findings could lead to better ways to treat chronic pain. They did brain scans of people who were expecting pain and found that a certain area was activated, which may help prove a theory that the fear of pain is worse than the pain itself. ''One knows the situation where one clings to the dentist chair in anticipation of pain and probably because of that finds the pain subsequently gets more intense than if they relaxed,'' Dr. Ploghaus said in a telephone interview. His team recruited 12 volunteers who agreed to be strapped to a machine that would nearly burn their hands, deliver a warm feeling or do nothing at all. Each painful pulse was preceded by a light of one color, warmth by another color and nothing by yet a third color. The volunteers quickly learned to associate a certain color light with pain. ''We measured brain activity throughout the experiment,'' Dr. Ploghaus said. The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging, which measured which brain cells were activated by detecting how much oxygen was used. Although there was some variation by individuals, for the most part one part of the brain lighted up in anticipation of the painful burn and another lighted up when the burn itself was delivered. ''Expectation of pain activated sites within the medial frontal lobe, insular cortex and cerebellum distinct from, but close to, locations mediating pain experience itself,'' Dr. Ploghaus's team wrote. ''The area that has been involved in anticipation of pain is an area that is believed to be involved in 'gut feeling' decision,'' Dr. Ploghaus said. Previous experiments have shown that people often realize something unconsciously before they realize it consciously, and a certain part of the brain is activated. This could be involved in pain response, too. ''I think we are seeing here some autonomic conditioning,'' Dr. Ploghaus said, ''the typical changes that you see when you have to run away from a threat.'' Dr. Ploghaus, who experimented on himself before subjecting volunteers, said the heat was bad enough to be distressing but not enough to cause a burn. ''I felt quite threatened when I saw the light preceding the pain,'' he said. He hopes to use this research to help people with chronic pain. Recent studies suggest that the fear of pain is much worse than the pain itself for such patients. Patients will, for example, contort their bodies to avoid pain, thus causing even more. ''We want to screen drugs and psychotherapy for their ability to reduce the anticipation activation,'' Dr. Ploghaus said. ''If that activity is abolished, that shows us these treatments can be effective in reducing pain in chronic pain patients.'' The theory would explain why narcotics, antidepressants and antianxiolytics work for pain. None address the pain itself but rather make the patient less anxious about it.", "headline": {"main": "Fear of Pain May Be Worse Than Pain Itself"}, "abstract": "Dr Alexander Ploghaus and colleagues at Britain's Oxford University and in Canada study peoples' fear of pain; say they hope their findings can lead to better ways to treat chronic pain; researchers do brain scans of people who were expecting pain and find that certain area is involved, which may help prove theory that fear of pain is worse than pain itself (M)", "print_page": "14", "word_count": 527, "_id": "4fd1ea2b8eb7c8105d739753", "snippet": "It is a common reaction: fear of the dentist's drill.
