But the Court said the removal of the luggage from its owner is an ''investigatory detention'' subject to constitutional limitations. The Justices agreed unanimously that Federal narcotics agents violated a traveler's constitutional rights when they held his suitcase at Kennedy International Airport for 90 minutes. Three of the Justices said, however, that it was unnecessary for the Court to address the question of the canine sniff.", "headline": {"main": "JUSTICES UPHOLD 'CANINE SNIFF' OF LUGGAGE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "21", "word_count": 1197, "_id": "4fd13a5f8eb7c8105d60f83b", "snippet": "The Supreme Court ruled today that the police may expose a traveler's luggage to a narcotics-detecting dog without violating the Constitution, but the luggage may be held for only a brief period.

He was always so calm that everyone who knew him, including his wife, was shocked when he suffered a heart attack. The executive survived the heart attack to undergo studies at the University of Nebraska's Life Stress Simulation Laboratory, which revealed that his calm exterior belied hidden chaotic changes in his cardiovascular system whenever he was under stress. He was what Dr. Robert S. Eliot and his colleagues there have dubbed a ''hot reactor.'' Their recent discovery of this previously unappreciated response has led to a new understanding of how stress can precipitate heart disease and sudden death, even in people who seem outwardly calm. Hot reactors tend to overrespond physiologically under stress, although this overreaction is not apparent to anyone, including the hot reactors themselves. Their blood pressure rises sharply and other circulatory system responses may also occur: The output of the heart may increase or decrease, and the blood vessels may become more or less resistant to the flow of blood.", "headline": {"main": "HEART ATTACKS: TURMOIL BENEATH THE CALM"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1643, "_id": "4fd12fb28eb7c8105d5fc848", "snippet": "THE Omaha business executive, president of a major division of a multimillion-dollar conglomerate, seemed to take in stride the demands of his work and of an active family life.
