But a little recapitulation can't hurt, and ''Tobacco Wars,'' which begins tonight on The Learning Channel, is a forceful reminder of an industry's half-century of efforts to obscure, obfuscate and delude.

The old advertisements add a touch of nostalgia to the program's grim indictment.", "snippet": "By now few viewers can be astonished to learn that cigarette makers have not been models of candor when it comes to their products' effects on the health of their customers.
