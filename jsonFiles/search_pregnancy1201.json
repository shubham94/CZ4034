Youngsters today may have it easier, though, thanks to the thus far unacknowledged efforts of anonymous Hollywood sitcom writers. According to a new study, watching TV is a highly effective means of teaching teenagers about sensitive sexual issues like, just to name one, condom leakage. Researchers at the RAND Corporation have found that a single episode of ''Friends'' centering on Rachel's unplanned pregnancy due to the untimely failure of Ross's condom stuck in the heads of most teenagers who viewed it, and especially those who viewed it with an adult and discussed it together afterward. Six months later, RAND found, the teenagers still recalled its gist: life is imperfect and sometimes rubbers rupture.", "headline": {"main": "Sex-Ed Night School", "kicker": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 11-16-03"}, "abstract": "Walter Kirn article compares sex education he got in high school 'Health' class with what teenagers today are picking up from television sitcoms; photo (L)", "print_page": "23", "word_count": 864, "_id": "4fd2491b8eb7c8105d7e6651", "snippet": "Sex education was an awkward business once.
