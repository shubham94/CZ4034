Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'A NIGHT IN NOVEMBER' Previews start Tuesday. Opens March 17.

'WELL' Previews start tonight. Opens March 30. After a successful run at the Public Theater, Lisa Kron and her mom, played by Jayne Houdyshell, come to Broadway in this metadrama about theater, sickness and family (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL' This Theater for a New Audience production inspires a quiet prayer of thanks to the theater gods. Here is that rare Shakespeare production in which there is nary an incompetent, misjudged or ineffective performance in a significant role. Darko Tresnjak and his cast find a way to make the play's troubled romance, between the adoring Helena and the disdaining Bertram, psychologically credible and even touching (2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Zinoman) 'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'GREY GARDENS' As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'HEDDA GABLER' In the title role of Ibsen's destructively dissatisfied heroine, Cate Blanchett is giving roughly a dozen of the liveliest performances to be seen this year, all at the same time, in the Sydney Theater Company's visiting production. A mere one or two at this level of intensity would have been enough. But she remains compellingly watchable in Robyn Nevin's hyped-up, spasmodic production (2:25). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. (Brantley) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger) 'INDOOR/OUTDOOR' A comedy by Kenny Finkle about a housecat torn between affection for her human companion and a sexy tomcat promising a tour of the great outdoors. Directed by Darren Goldstein and energetically performed by a cast of four, it's essentially just another dysfunctional relationship tale, with little kitty whiskers drawn on (1:50). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE MUSIC TEACHER, A PLAY/OPERA' A pair of interlocking monologues surrounding a little parody of an opera, with text by Wallace Shawn and music by his brother Allen. Written two decades ago and shelved when the authors failed to find a producer, this is a minor-key, underrealized work that hits a few elegiac notes but steps too gingerly around the psychosexual trauma at its core (1:45). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, the play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SOLDIER'S WIFE' When this play first opened on Broadway, World War II was shuddering to a close, and those on the home front wanted to feel good. Despite flaws in the work, the Mint Theater Company's revival of Rose Franken's 1944 comedy is highly entertaining (2:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Honor Moore) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) * 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON' A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Moore) Off Off Broadway 'EL QUIJOTE' Sancho Panza is the real star of this often rollicking but uneven adaptation of Cervantes's ''Don Quijote.'' Caution: no windmills. In Spanish with simultaneous English translation (1:40). Repertorio Espa\u00f1ol, at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (George Hunka) 'THE TRAVELING LADY' A small but affecting production of Horton Foote's 1954 play, produced by Ensemble Studio Theater in association with Baylor University, where Marion Castleberry's staging originated. Like ''The Trip to Bountiful,'' of roughly the same vintage, this is a delicately drawn portrait of an anxious spirit in search of home, in this case a young wife looking to reunite with her ne'er-do-well husband (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ACTS OF MERCY: PASSION-PLAY' If there is a coherent story to Michael John Garc\u00e9s' ''Acts of Mercy: passion-play,'' it is resolutely kept from the audience. As the efforts of two brothers to reconcile with a dying father progress, it seems possible that viewers are meant to discern the consequences of family trauma from punchy monosyllabic combat and repeated expletives, but their efforts to connect are continually frustrated (2:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, west of Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Moore) 'CLEAN ALTERNATIVES' Brian Dykstra's improbable comedy details the good fight fought by a businesswoman turned environmental activist taking on a toxin-spreading megacorporation. The play also depicts the moral transformation of a rapacious lawyer into a love-smitten puppy dog. Call it a fairy tale for our time (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street; closing Sunday. (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'THE SEVEN' The wild ride of luckless ol' Oedipus -- accidentally offing Dad, marrying Mom, being dissed by the kids -- gets pimped to the nines in this frisky and funny new riff on the classic story. Written by Will Power and directed by Jo Bonney, the show is a freewheeling adaptation of one of the more static, less revered Greek tragedies, Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'': a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529; closing tomorrow. (Brantley) 'THE WOODEN BREEKS' The line dividing inspired whimsy from tedious nonsense can be a fine one, and much of this new play by Glen Berger falls on the wrong side of it. An elaborately conceived comedy seeking to celebrate the consolations of storytelling, it unfolds the tale of a Scottish tinker who dreams up imaginary worlds to keep despair at bay (2:00). MCC Theater, at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AQUAMARINE' (PG, 109 minutes) In this sweet comedy for the crowd that has outgrown ''The Little Mermaid,'' two likable pals (Emma Roberts and Joanna Levesque, a k a the singer JoJo) try to help a mermaid (Sara Paxton) find love and learn how to use her feet properly.(Neil Genzlinger) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden) * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott) 'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott) 'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Manohla Dargis) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'LITTLE FISH' (R, 114 minutes) In this tough, savvy Australian film, Cate Blanchett sinks deeply into the role of a 32-year-old recovering heroin addict trying to rebuild her life and fighting the temptation to relapse. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoon-worthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World Tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'THE SHAGGY DOG' (PG, 98 minutes) Tim Allen is a prosecutor who is going, as it were, to the dogs in this revisiting of the old Disney film, which is far livelier than its namesake. Scenes in which Mr. Allen tries to fight off his inner canine while a no-nonsense judge played by Jane Curtin is holding a trial are comic gems.(Genzlinger) '16 BLOCKS' (PG-13, 105 minutes) If Richard Donner's presence suggests that his new action flick, ''16 Blocks,'' is a throwback to the 1980's, so does one of the names holding pride of place above the title, Bruce Willis. Mr. Willis has always been an acquired taste, but for those who did acquire that taste, it's a pleasure to see him doing what comes naturally. Which means holding a gun and fending off bad guys with as few words as possible. (Dargis) * 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist in the 1940's, arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the movie rise above its indie road-picture clich\u00e9s. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis) 'ULTRAVIOLET' (PG-13, 80 minutes) The latest in movies structured around eyewear and abdominals, ''Ultraviolet'' stars Milla Jovovich as a genetically modified human -- part vampire, part chameleon, all model -- and one of the many victims of a government experiment to improve on nature. Directed by Kurt Wimmer with a fine eye for the preferences of 12-year-old boys, ''Ultraviolet'' cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly.(Jeannette Catsoulis) 'Unknown White Male' (PG-13, 88 minutes) The British filmmaker Rupert Murray tells the bizarre story of his old friend Doug Bruce, who in 2003 walked into a Coney Island hospital claiming not to know who he was, thereupon becoming either a heart-wrenching casualty of a medical anomaly or the prime suspect in a mystery yet to be solved. (Dargis) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned \u00fcber-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon (winner of the Academy Award for best actress), who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series ANNA MAY WONG (Through April 16) Wong, the first Chinese-American movie star, would have turned 100 last year. (She died in 1961.) The Museum of the Moving Image's extensive seven-week retrospective of her work continues this weekend with two silents directed by Richard Eichberg: ''Song'' (1928), in which Wong plays a dancer in love with a knife thrower, and ''The Pavement Butterfly,'' about a woman who runs away to the French Riviera after she is framed for murder. Both films will be accompanied by live music. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Anita Gates) DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through Monday) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films, which has run five weeks this year, concludes on Monday with ''A Model for Matisse: The Story of the Vence Chapel'' (2005), about Henri Matisse's friendship and special project with a French Dominican nun.

(Gates) PRIX JEAN VIGO (Through Dec. 30) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Vigo (1905-34), the French filmmaker, with a series of 41 films from directors who have won the prize that bears his name. This weekend's feature is ''Qui \u00cates-Vous, Polly Maggoo?'' (1965), William Klein's satire about the French fashion world, shown with ''Des Filles et des Chiens'' (1991), Sophie Filli\u00e8res's short about adolescent friendship. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10.

(Gates) SOME KIND OF HORROR SHOW (Through March 30) BAMcin\u00e9matek's annual festival of horror movies continues on Monday and Tuesday with Kaneto Shindo's ''Kuroneko'' (1968), about the murderous spirits of two women killed by samurai in feudal Japan. On Thursday, ''Innocent Blood'' (1992), the adventures of a modern-day vampire who bites only bad people, will be shown, along with Michael Jackson's 13-minute ''Thriller'' video (1983). John Landis, who directed both, will hold a question-and-answer session afterward. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ALASH ENSEMBLE WITH KONGAR-OOL ONDAR (Monday) These Tuvan musicians stretch the definition of throat singing, the traditional, polyphonic technique, by adding some Western music elements. 9:30 p.m., Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; $12. (Laura Sinagra) THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND (Tonight, tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday) The archetypal Southern rock band is still on the road. Gregg Allman, the band's keyboardist and main singer, is more than ever its center, since its co-founder Dickey Betts is estranged from the group. His replacement, Warren Haynes, shares the twin-guitar passages with Derek Trucks, the drummer Butch Trucks's nephew and a jam-band leader in his own right. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $49.99 to $84.99. (Jon Pareles) THE BATS (Sunday and Wednesday) Having just released its first album in a decade, this pastoral New Zealand guitar pop band continues to make the loose yet ornately pretty music that defined Kiwi-pop's 1980's heyday. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sinagra) JAMES BLUNT (Tuesday and Wednesday) With a Rod Stewart vocal tone that can also flip into transporting falsetto, this British artist writes songs in the ethereal but angsty Elliott Smith vein, only with more forceful alt-pop production. His song ''No Bravery'' is an antiwar lament that clings. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Both shows sold out.) (Sinagra) CRISTINA BRANCO (Tomorrow) The Portuguese songs called fado (fate) balance sorrowful melodies and lyrics about tragic destiny in a gleaming cat's cradle of finger-picked Portuguese guitars. It's music that frames a singer's voice while it mercilessly exposes every nuance of sorrow and determination. Cristina Branco is one of Portugal's most celebrated young fadistas. 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 992-8484; $32. (Pareles) ISOBEL CAMPBELL (Monday) This feather-voiced former member of Belle and Sebastian has made her own music as the Gentle Waves but also does so under her own name; she recently collaborated on some atmospheric music with Mark Lanegan of Screaming Trees. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; $15. (Sinagra) THE CLOUD ROOM, FILM SCHOOL (Tomorrow) The new-wave-influenced na\u00eff rockers the Cloud Room garnered wild, though deeply underground, buzz when their best song, ''Hey Hey Now,'' written during the frontman's grave illness, was given lots of wish-you-wells but never broke into larger indie-pop consciousness. The wistful rock band Film School also plays. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) DILATED PEOPLES, LITTLE BROTHER (Wednesday and Thursday) The straightforward rap of the Los Angeles group Dilated Peoples tries to offer a tough-guy corrective to gangsta bullying and shallow pop hip-hop. The result is short on fun. Little Brother's soul-grounded Carolina rap forgoes Southern crunk in favor of blending the free-form experimentation of Outkast with the kind of jazzy tracks that characterized East Coast hip-hop of the mid-1990's. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $25. (Sinagra) TOM DUNNE AND FRIENDS: A TRIBUTE TO PADDY CRONIN (Tonight) The Irish music traditionalist and multi-instrumentalist Tom Dunne pays tribute to the County Kerry fiddle legend Paddy Cronin. He is joined by the guitarist John Dillon and other musicians. 9, Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, 1 Washington Mews, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-3950; $15; free to Ireland House members and N.Y.U. students. (Sinagra) EARLY MAN, PRIESTESS, THE SWORD (Tomorrow) The Ohio band Early Man is a heavy-metal duo that harks back to genre polestars like Judas Priest. Likewise, the Texans in the Sword do a great approximation of Black Sabbath's slow menace, at points also revealing hard-core punk underpinnings with intermittent thrash bravura. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, (201) 653-1703; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra) DEBORAH GIBSON (Tomorrow) Back in the 1980's she was Debbie Gibson, a teenage pop star correlate to Molly Ringwald, charming her way up the charts with hits like ''Shake Your Love'' and ''Lost in Your Eyes.'' Now she's a grown-up who does Broadway and hosts VH1 shows about, what else, teenage stars. 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, SoHo, (212) 941-8100; $30. (Sinagra) HOT CHIP (Tomorrow) London's literate electro-poppers Hot Chip find room in their techno-savvy spectrum for wiseacre hat-tips to rap, R&B, indie rock and hip, wispy folk. 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sinagra) JANIS IAN (Tuesday) The singer-songwriter Janis Ian is still most famous for the folkie lament ''Society's Child'' and the ugly-duckling anthem ''At Seventeen,'' but the work of this rich-voiced musician is more varied than these, never shying away from the painful nuances of aging and loss, but always seeking redemption. Tuesday, she celebrates the release of her 20th major-label album, ''Folk Is the New Black.'' 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra) NISHAT KHAN (Tonight) The sitar player Nishat Khan comes from a long line of Indian virtuosos, including his father, Ustad Imrat Khan.

(Sinagra) BETTYE LaVETTE, MARCIA BALL (Thursday) Bettye LaVette of Detroit released her first recording when she was 16, and soldiered on through a career that carried her through 15 labels, minor rhythm-and-blues hits like ''He Made a Woman Out of Me'' and years in Europe. But her tough, knowing voice and sense of drama could rival Tina Turner's. Marcia Ball plays two-fisted New Orleans barrelhouse piano and sings in a husky, knowing voice about all the trouble men and women can get into on the way to a good time. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $26.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles) SONDRE LERCHE, PAUL BRILL (Tonight) Since making an indie cabaret-rock splash in 2002, the music of the Norwegian guitarist-crooner Sondre Lerche has suggested life experience beyond its confident purveyor's tender years. Lately he has taken a break from the baroque, applying his breathy yet urgent voice to a batch of lighthearted, stripped-down jazzy tunes. The local songwriter Paul Brill opens. 7:30, Housing Works Bookstore Caf\u00e9, 126 Crosby Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-3324; $25. (Sinagra) LES SAVY FAV (Tonight) The rockers Les Savvy Fav play revved-up punk with coiffed and stylish contours. 8, Warsaw at the Polish National Home, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 645-5156; $16.50. (Sinagra) LILYS (Tomorrow) This Philadelphia indie rock band is rendered consistently fascinating by the mercurial nature of its frontman (and only constant member), Kurt Heasley, who has exuded recalcitrant charisma as both an early-1990's shoe gazer and, later, an Anglophilic retro-rocker. 8 p.m., Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, near Henry Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069; $10. (Sinagra) SAMARA LUBELSKI, MI & L'AU (Tonight) Samara Lubelski, best known for her collaborations with the psychedelic outfits Hall of Fame and Tower Recordings, goes solo here. The Finnish singer Mi and the French musician L'au, after becoming a couple in Paris, moved to the woods in Finland to record what they will showcase here, a cache of austere, wintery bedroom folk. 8, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10. (Sinagra) MARAH (Tonight) This Philly-bred band has, in its decade-plus existence, pushed beyond scruffy alt-country into the realms of quirky bar rock and lo-fi 70's folk. 9, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $12. (Sinagra) METRIC (Tonight) Led by the vibrant, articulate singer Emily Hanes, this band finds fresh uses for new-wave brio. Ms. Hanes's shuddering alto functions alternately as a weapon and a whip-cracking come-on. 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) THE POGUES (Thursday) Before every beer-brewing ethnicity spawned a punk band modernizing its traditionals with lashing, distorted guitar and aggressive, often hilarious howls, there was Ireland's Pogues. Its leader, Shane MacGowan, a man of tossed-off wit, ubiquitous slurring and few teeth, picked up in the 00's where he left off before the band's 90's hiatus. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $50. (Sinagra) QUEEN WITH PAUL ROdGERS (Sunday) Paul Rodgers, the swaggering lead singer of Free, Bad Company and the Firm, can't scale the falsetto highs of Queen's histrionic legend, Freddie Mercury, so he doesn't try. What results is a more democratized and meaty take on the band's worthy hits. 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000; $35 to $125. (Sinagra) Jane Siberry (Tomorrow) Jane Siberry is always trying another collaboration or another musical strategy. Her sweetly tousled voice, her sly intelligence, her determination to explore and her playful fascination with family, archetype and myth can all lead to intimate epiphanies. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 501-1390; $32 to $38. (Pareles) ALLEN TOUSSAINT: NEW ORLEANS BENEFIT BRUNCH (Sunday) The legendary New Orleans songwriter, producer and pianist Allen Toussaint, at one point rumored missing after Hurricane Katrina, performs for the benefit of continuing hurricane relief efforts in the Crescent City. Noon, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Avenue, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $30 for adults; $15 for children under 12. (Sinagra) JERRY JEFF WALKER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jerry Jeff Walker wrote the hit ''Mr. Bojangles,'' but around his home-stomping grounds of Texas, he's the easygoing, gruffly avuncular icon of the cosmic cowboy mentality, all about spacing out in the wide-open spaces. 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35 in advance, $40 at the door. (Pareles) WALTER (WOLFMAN) WASHINGTON (Wednesday) Mr. Washington, a New Orleans guitarist, has been a trusty funky collaborator for the likes of Bobby (Blue) Bland and Irma Thomas. His shows are usually rump-shaking affairs. 9 p.m., Coda, 34 East 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-3434; $17.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden) * Barbara Cook (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) This Broadway legend is loose and down-home and, as always, magnificent singing a 25-year retrospective of songs she has performed at the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle. 8:45 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100; dinner required at the 8:45 shows. (Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Tomorrow) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 7 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) Samantha Sidley (Tonight and tomorrow night) This budding 20-year-old winner of the Oak Room's young artist competition, accompanied by fellow students from the Berklee College of Music, is a charmingly sunny but still half-formed jazz interpreter. 9 and 11:30, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $50, with a $50 prix fixe dinner at the early shows, or $20 minimum at the late shows. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. J. D.

(Nate Chinen) RAN BLAKE/CHARLES GAYLE (Tonight) Mr. Blake is a pianist with an attraction to cinematic imagery and spooky silence; Mr. Gayle, better known as a fiery saxophonist, has his own rumbling touch at the keys. Each has a new solo piano album on Tompkins Square Records, and each plays in that format here. 8 (Mr. Blake and Mr. Gayle) and 10 (Mr. Gayle alone), the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10.

(Chinen) GERALD CLEAVER'S UNCLE JUNE (Wednesday) Dealing less in rhythm than in pulse, Mr. Cleaver's drumming perfectly suits the fluid requirements of jazz's post-everything avant-garde; this ruminative project features the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the violinist Mat Maneri, the keyboardist Craig Taborn and the bassist Drew Gress. 10 p.m., Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8.

(Chinen) * ROY HAYNES QUARTET (Tuesday through March 19) Now in his 80's, Mr. Haynes is irrefutably an elder statesman, but his drumming, like his sartorial sense, evinces a boldly contemporary swagger. He has lost nothing, it seems, to the years; what he has gained is unmatched experience and a legend commensurate with his talent. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) DAVE LIEBMAN'S DIFFERENT BUT THE SAME (Tonight) An incantatory saxophonist working in the post-Coltrane idiom, Mr. Liebman digs in with several fellow adventurers: the saxophonist Ellery Eskelin, the bassist Tony Marino and the drummer Nasheet Waits. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $15, including two drinks. (Chinen) JOE LOVANO QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Lovano has become one of the stalwart saxophonists in modern jazz, equally inspired by John Coltrane's harmonic inquiry, Ornette Coleman's off-kilter lyricism and Ben Webster's heart-rending croon; this band, his newest, includes James Weidman on piano, Esperanza Spalding on bass and Francisco Mela on drums. 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) MARCUS PRINTUP (Tonight) Mr. Printup's trumpet style has more than a little in common with that of Wynton Marsalis, his bandleader in the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra; out on his own, he goes for flashier, more avowedly modern exertions. 7 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344, www.rmanyc.org; $15. (Chinen) MARC RIBOT AND HENRY GRIMES (Thursday) Mr. Ribot is a vagabond poet on solo electric guitar, as he proved with the album ''Saints'' (Atlantic) five years ago. Here he plays both solo and in a duo with Mr. Grimes, a bassist and long-lost titan of the avant-garde; there's no knowing which setting will sound better. 8 p.m., Issue Project Room, 400 Carroll Street, between Bond and Nevins Streets, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org; cover, $10. (Chinen) EDWARD SIMON'S VENEZUELAN PROJECT (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Simon, a pianist whose most recent credits include work with the Brazilian singer Luciana Souza, turns his focus here toward the country of his birth. His serious sextet consists of the saxophonist Mark Turner, the flutist Marco Granados, the cuatro and guitar player Aquiles B\u00e1ez, the bassist John Patitucci and the drummer Adam Cruz. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25.(Chinen) * BOBO STENSON TRIO (Wednesday through March 18) With ''Goodbye'' (ECM), the Swedish pianist Bobo Stenson offered one of last year's most beautifully somber piano trio recordings. Here he plays his only live performances with the same personnel from the album: his longtime bassist Anders Jormin, a fellow Swede, and the august and inscrutable New York drummer Paul Motian. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) YOSVANY TERRY GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Terry, a saxophonist and percussionist, chases contemporary post-bop ideals without fighting the rhythmic pull of his native Cuba; this seven-piece ensemble is only slightly smaller than the one on his excellent new album, ''Metamorphosis'' (Kindred Rhythm), and no less fierce. 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15. (Chinen) THE TUBA PROJECT (Tomorrow) Though the name may suggest otherwise, there's only one tuba player in this ensemble; given that it's Bob Stewart, the instrument's greatest improviser, one should be enough. As on the new album ''The Tuba Project'' (CIMP), he's joined by the pianist Lucian Ban, the baritone saxophonist Alex Harding, the tenor saxophonist J. D. Allen and the drummer Derrek Phillips. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) DAVID WEISS (Tonight and tomorrow; Wednesday) This weekend, Mr. Weiss, a literate and industrious trumpeter, leads his post-bop quintet; on Wednesday, he assembles Endangered Species, a 12-piece ensemble stocked with serious talent and dedicated to the music of Wayne Shorter. Tonight and tomorrow at 12:30 a.m. , Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $10, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. Wednesday at 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) The Amato Opera's reputation is that it conveys the spirit and love of Italian opera, though the full impact is impossible to achieve in a 102-seat theater with a cast that changes at every performance. And against the odds, all the principals at a recent performance of ''Aida'' managed to make it through to the end, demonstrating a true love of the piece, if not always of the pitch. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) 'LA BOH\u00c8ME' (Sunday and Thursday) City Opera has a refreshing take on Puccini's perennial classic, updating it to the eve of World War I and presenting some of its regulars, including Kelly Kaduce and Shannah Timms. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 tickets remaining on Sunday; $16 to $120 on Thursday. (Midgette) 'DARKLING' (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) In an adventurous move, American Opera Projects is presenting a brave and sensitive, if at times frustrating, multimedia work. With a score by Stefan Weisman, ''Darkling'' is an ''operatic fantasia on themes of emotional fragmentation,'' in the words of the director Michael Comlish, who conceived the idea of adapting for the stage Anna Rabinowitz's book-length poem about a restless Polish couple who marry hastily before the invasion of the Nazis. 8 p.m., East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; $30 to $45. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LA FORZA DEL DESTINO' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) It's tempting to say that ''Forza'' has the most numbingly witless libretto of any Verdi opera, but with such stiff competition, who can say? Giancarlo del Monaco's drab staging, first seen in 1996, offers little help, but the Met has a solid first cast, with Deborah Voigt as Leonora, Salvatore Licitra as Don Alvaro and Mark Delavan as Don Carlo. On Wednesday, Elena Zelenskaya replaces Ms. Voigt, and Mark Rucker takes over for Mr. Delavan. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Wednesday. (Allan Kozinn) 'LUISA MILLER' (Monday) None of Verdi's Schiller operas are very Schiller-like; this one becomes melodrama in the silent-movie sense, with the miller's beautiful daughter, an evil henchman and thwarted love. The Met's casting doesn't preserve much of the fresh-faced innocence of the story, but offers established singers: Veronica Villarroel as Luisa, and Neil Shicoff as Rodolfo. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Midgette) 'MAZEPPA' (Tonight and Tuesday) Tchaikovsky's epic 1884 opera, about the ruthless 17th-century Ukrainian separatist Ivan Mazeppa, is an anguished, probing and noble work. The Met deserves thanks for presenting its first production of this inexplicably neglected masterpiece, inspiringly conducted by Valery Gergiev. A cast of mostly Russian singers brings conviction and palpable authority, especially the baritone Nikolai Putilin as the wizened Mazeppa, and the soprano Olga Guryakova as his adolescent and impressionable wife. The musical performance is so compelling that you can almost ignore Yuri Alexandrov's jumbled and trashy production, which clutters the opera with symbolism. Tonight at 8, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205. (Tommasini) 'THE MOST HAPPY FELLA' (Tonight and tomorrow) Frank Loesser thought of his 1956 masterpiece as a ''musical with a lot of music,'' not as an opera. Still, this sophisticated and disarming musical is a good fit for the New York City Opera, which has opened its spring season with a vibrant and charming production by Philip Wm. McKinley. Paul Sorvino, making his City Opera debut, inhabits the title role of Tony Esposito, the paunchy, insecure but good-hearted Italian immigrant vineyard owner in the Napa Valley of the 1920's. His voice, though, is pretty raw and shaky. He's at his best when he doesn't care about how he sounds and just lets go. The rest of the cast, mostly from the musical theater world, is wonderful. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 1:30 and 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 to $120. (Tommasini) Classical Music KATE ALDRICH (Monday) Tapping exciting young singers is a tradition the Opera Orchestra of New York hopes to continue. This one is a strong young mezzo-soprano who has already appeared with the group, offering a recital of Berlioz, Britten, Chausson, Dvorak, Mozart and Strauss. 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35. (Midgette) ATLANTA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) Between Lincoln Center's Golijov festival and his recent appearances leading the New York Philharmonic, Robert Spano seems to be spending nearly as much time in New York as with his own orchestra in Atlanta. He gets to have it both ways tomorrow, when he leads the Atlanta Symphony and its chorus in the Verdi Requiem. The vocal soloists are Andrea Gruber, Stephanie Blythe, Frank Lopardo and Greer Grimsley. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $23 to $79. (Kozinn) BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Tonight, the Waterville Trio plays music by Rachmaninoff, Chopin and Lachert. Tomorrow and Sunday, the veteran cellist Colin Carr is joined by the pianist Thomas Sauer for a recital of works by Prokofiev, Beethoven and Chopin. Thursday, the versatile folk-jazz-classical fiddler Mark O'Connor brings his Edgeffect Ensemble (a piano trio) for its first New York performance, featuring his own compositions. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m.; Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35. (Eichler) JONATHAN BISS AND THE MENDELSSOHN STRING QUARTET (Tonight) The Mendelssohn Quartet opens with the Andante and Scherzo (Op. 81) by its namesake and also plays Beethoven's ''Harp'' in E flat. The superb pianist Jonathan Biss -- whose mother, Miriam Fried, is one of the Mendelssohn players -- joins for the Dvorak A major Piano Quintet. 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Kozinn) JESSE BLUMBERG (Sunday) The Marilyn Horne Foundation, in its continuing effort to keep the tradition of the song recital flourishing, presents young singers in a monthly series of informal recitals. Mr. Blumberg, a New Jersey-born baritone who recently appeared as Papageno with the Milwaukee Opera Theater, will sing a varied program with the pianist Martin Katz. 3 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue and 50th Street, (212) 378-0248; $20; $15 for 65+; free to students. (Tommasini) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Wednesday) The Orion String Quartet performs Mendelssohn's Quartet No. 6 and Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's Quartet No. 2. But the most ear-opening score on the program may be the String Sextet of Erwin Schulhoff, a German-speaking Czech Jew and victim of Nazism, whose fantastically eclectic body of work includes a Dadaist ''Sonata Erotica'' and a cantata setting of ''The Communist Manifesto.'' 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $30 to $52. (Eichler) VLADIMIR FELTSMAN (Tomorrow) The Peoples' Symphony Concerts are a great deal if you're looking to hear big-name performers without breaking the bank. This weekend, the formidable pianist Vladimir Feltsman plays works by Haydn, Beethoven and Schumann. 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, 16th Street and Irving Place, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680; $9 (Eichler). JERUSALEM SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Sunday) Leon Botstein brings his new out-of-town orchestra to Carnegie Hall. Martinu's ''Memorial to Lidice'' will be the item of interest, along with music by Prokofiev and Strauss. 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $20 to $80. (Bernard Holland) OLGA KERN (Thursday) This dynamic young Russian pianist, who shared a gold at the Van Cliburn Competition in 2001, plays Mendelssohn, Chopin, Rachmaninoff and Liszt. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $20 to $50. (Eichler) KIROV ORCHESTRA (Sunday and Monday) To mark the Shostakovich centenary, Lincoln Center has invited Valery Gergiev to lead all 15 symphonies -- no, not in one stretch, though you wouldn't put it past Mr. Gergiev to try. The conductor will split his survey between his two ensembles: the Kirov Orchestra, here this week, and the Rotterdam Philharmonic, arriving next month. Sunday's program features the Symphonies Nos. 1, 2 and 10; Monday brings Nos. 7 and 9. Sunday at 3 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $35 to $69. (Eichler) MARGARET LATTIMORE, STEPHANIE NOVACEK, MARY PHILLIPS, JAKE HEGGIE, RICKY IAN GORDON and EUGENIA ZUCKERMAN (Tuesday) The idea is simpler than the long roster of names would suggest: music by Mr. Gordon and Mr. Heggie, accompanied by the composers on the piano and by a flute, sung by three mezzo-sopranos, with just a soup\u00e7on of Ned Rorem and Stephen Sondheim. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $32. (Midgette) ALEXANDER LONQUICH (Wednesday) Though widely respected in Europe, this 45-year-old German-born pianist, now living in Italy, is not well known in the United States. For this, his American recital debut, he plays the New York premiere of Wolfgang Rihm's ''Tombeau'' and works by Mozart, Schumann, Chopin and C. P. E. Bach. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Tommasini) JEANNE MALLOW (Tomorrow) Though this violist comes from a distinguished family of string players (including her grandmother, the violist Lillian Fuchs, and her great-uncle, the violinist Joseph Fuchs), she has built her career on her own, with notable performances and recordings. For this program she will play works by Vivaldi, Schumann, Rachmaninoff and William Keith Rogers, with the pianist Vladimir Valjarevic. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Tommasini) SOHEIL NASSERI (Tomorrow) This young Californian pianist has both a magnificent technique and an inventive interpretive spirit, qualities that served him well in the early installments of his two-season Beethoven cycle. Mr. Nasseri has chosen not to present the sonatas in chronological order, so his concluding program actually leaves him among relatively early works: Nos. 8 (the ''Path\u00e9tique'') through 11, and 16. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $33 and $45. (Kozinn) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) After canceling last week because of bad health, Christoph von Dohnanyi plans to return to conduct a program that includes Bartok's ''Bluebeard's Castle'' with Anne Sofie von Otter and Matthias Goerne. 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $94. (Holland) ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Monday) Bach has been a good venture for this conductorless group, which has been joined this year by the conductorless Bach Choir and started a series of Bach cantatas with members of the choir in the appropriate setting of the Metropolitan Museum's Medieval Sculpture Hall. On the program: Cantatas 18, 157, and 193. 8 p.m., the Metropolitan Museum, (212) 570-3949; $60. (Midgette) CHARLES ROSEN (Sunday) Mr. Rosen is as renowned for his insightful books and essays as for his probing piano performances, but his playing is by no means bookish: as concerned as he is with the details of style and structure, he is also intent on showing composers as animated by passions and desires, and working within a historical context that includes influences and competitors. Mr. Rosen will explore the influence of Bach and Haydn on Mozart in a program that includes selections from Bach's ''Art of Fugue'' and ''Musical Offering,'' as well as Haydn's Sonata No. 43 and Divertimento in F, and Mozart's Gigue in G and Sonata in A minor. 1:30 p.m. (lecture) and 3 p.m. (recital), 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Kozinn) NADJA SALERNO-SONNENBERG (Tuesday) It is the season of Brahms violin sonatas: Less than a month after Christian Tetzlaff played all three in Alice Tully Hall, Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg tackles the same program on the same stage. Given their radically different performance styles, the overlaps should end there. The pianist Anne-Marie McDermott joins. 8 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Eichler) JORDI SAVALL AND HESP\u00c8RION XXI (Wednesday and Thursday) A fantastic performer on the viola da gamba and also one of the early-music world's most inventive ensemble leaders, Mr. Savall presides over what promises to be an illuminating master class on Wednesday. The next night, he leads in his flagship ensemble, Hesp\u00e8rion XXI, in variations by Diego Ortiz, Lucas Ruiz de Ribayaz, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00edn, Juan Hidalgo, Gaspar Sanz and Antonio Mart\u00edn. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $25 on Wednesday, in Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium; $60 on Thursday, in the Medieval Sculpture Hall (sold out); $25 for a preconcert discussion on Thursday at 6 p.m. with Mr. Savall and David D'Arcy, in the Rogers Auditorium. (Kozinn) JEAN-YVES THIBAUDET (Wednesday) In the hearts of the French, Ravel and Schumann are kindred spirits. Mr. Thibaudet here plays piano music by both. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $21 to $72. (Holland) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. ATLANTA BALLET (Sunday) One of the oldest indigenous American ballet troupes, Atlanta Ballet will present two dances by John McFall, the company director, and one by Christopher Hampson. 2 p.m., Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, Brooklyn College, Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, Flatbush, (718) 951-4500, www.brooklyncenteronline.org; $15 to $30. (Jennifer Dunning) DANCEBRAZIL (Tonight through Sunday) Two programs explore the rich cultures of Bahia, Brazil, in choreography that merges Afro-Brazilian dance, live music and the martial arts form of capoeira, including a new dance by the company director Jelon Vieira to music by Tuz\u00e9 de Abreu. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, www.joyce.org; $42. (Dunning) GENE POOL AT DNA (Tonight through Sunday) A clever new name for that old favorite, the dance showcase. This one will feature four different programs of dance by seven artists, who include Isabel Gotkowsky, Earl Mosely and Laurie DeVito. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, between Reade and Chambers Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200; $17. (Dunning) DONNA SCRO GENTILE/FREESPACE DANCE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Gentile, who has danced with Sean Curran and Murray Louis, will present choreography set to music by Daniel Bernard Roumain, Glen Fittin, Tigger Benford and Peter Jones, performed by the resident company at Montclair State University. 8:30, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15.

(Jack Anderson) ASHLEIGH LEITE (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Autopsy,'' an emotionally charged evening of dance, light and sound, follows the interior journeys of five women. 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-9907; $15. (Anderson) SUSAN MARSHALL & COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow night) A skilled choreographic storyteller offers ''Cloudless,'' a collection of danced short stories, some explosive, others quietly intimate. 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, www.dtw.org; $15 and $25. (Anderson) * YVONNE MEIER (Thursday) Ms. Meier is returning after eight years to her enjoyably anarchic improvisational choreography. For her new pieces ''this is not a pink pony'' and ''Gogolorez,'' she has enlisted the aid of downtown-dance stars like Miguel Gutierrez, Jennifer Monson, Nami Yamamoto and Jeremy Wade. (Through March 18.) 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, ext. 14, www.thekitchen.org; $12. (Dunning) * BENJAMIN MILLEPIED & COMPANY (Tuesday through Thursday) One of the smartest and liveliest of New York City Ballet dancers, Mr. Millepied will lead his company, whose roster includes several bright young City Ballet performers and the American Ballet Theater star Gillian Murphy, in a new work by Aszure Barton and in three new dances of his own. They are set to scores that include piano music by Philip Glass, played by Pedja Muzijevic, and accompaniment cued by the dancers' motions. (Through March 19.)

Tuesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, www.joyce.org or, for gala tickets, (212) 691-9740; $42 (non-gala); $500 to $1,250 (gala).

There is also the first of three programs of small pieces at the Mark Morris Dance Center tomorrow afternoon. And there are all manner of ancillary events, a schedule for which can be found at www.mmdg.org. Tonight, tomorrow night and Wednesday night at 7:30, Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, www.bam.org; $20 to $70. The Solos, Duets and Trios program is tomorrow at 5 p.m., Mark Morris Dance Center, 3 Lafayette Avenue, near Flatbush Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn. (Sold out.) (John Rockwell) 92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow and Sunday) An annual event concludes with the Francesca Harper Project in ''Modo Fusion,'' a multimedia work that Ms. Harper, a dancer, singer and choreographer, conceived in collaboration with Brian Reeder, a former dancer with American Ballet Theater.

(Rockwell) SUMMERFEST '06: ANDREA HAENGGI/AMDAT (Tonight and tomorrow night) With the aid of dance and video, Andrea Haenggi's ''escalator'' transforms lobbies and moving stairways into four magical theaters, each evoking a mood of its own. 7 and 8:30, World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505 or www.worldfinancialcenter.com; free.

(Rockwell) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. Her works do not lend themselves to easy deciphering, but her magic with materials and her daring compositional imagination draw you in. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original F\u00e9lix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.)(Nicolai Ouroussoff) The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. (See above.) (Smith) P.S. 1: Jessica Stockholder: 'Of Standing Float Roots in Thin Air,' through May 1. A soaring, cannily designed installation -- made of airborne plastic bins, electric lights, orange extension cords and an old armchair topping a wooden tower -- by a sculptor known for orchestrating productive collisions of formalism and consumerism. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Ken Johnson) P.S. 1: 'Ricky Swallow,' through March 20. Extraordinarily realistic and symbolically portentous sculptures carved from wood by Australia's representative to last summer's Venice Biennale, in which three of the five works on view here were included. (See above.) (Johnson) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'LANDSCAPE,' through Sept. 18. With only 20 works dispersed throughout the Whitney's second floor, this startlingly fresh installation of recent art from the museum's collection uses space in an extravagant, exhilarating way, while weaving a cat's cradle of intersecting meanings, emotions, forms and processes through the landscapes of American art and history. It turns out that the less you look at, the more you can see, especially in an arrangement orchestrated by someone who believes that the best tool for coaxing out an artwork's polymorphous content is another piece of art. This someone is Donna De Salvo, the museum's new associate director for programs and curator of collections; her Whitney debut should be seen by anyone interested in the craft and art of a curator. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. Beauty is hard to come by. Check out, among other things, Paul Chan's digital animation of shadowy objects like cellphones and bicycles, floating upward, Wizard of Oz-like, while bodies tumble down, the work cast as if it were light from a tall window slanting onto the floor of a dark room. And also Pierre Huyghe's film, shot in Antarctica and Central Park. It's really gorgeous: crosscut between day and night, fiction and reality, it encapsulates the show's operative but ultimately airy metaphor about the slippery state of art now. (''Day for Night'' is the biennial's first-ever title, after the Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut film.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman) Galleries: Uptown Tony Cragg: 'Five Bottles' In the early 1980's, this eminent English sculptor made flat, mosaiclike works out of found colored plastic objects and fragments. This show presents a set of five wall-works, each representing a different giant colored bottle composed of toys, combs, cigarette lighters and other pieces of ordinary commercial detritus. Vivian Horan, 35 East 67th Street, (212) 517-9410, through April 21. (Johnson) Jim Shaw: 'My Mirage 1986- 91' This amazingly inventive California-based artist first became widely known for a series of about 170 works, all measuring 17 by 14 inches, that chronicles the life of a white suburban boy named Billy, from innocent youth to druggy degradation to born-again salvation. The 30 pieces from the series in this show variously imitate comic strips, acid-rock posters, thrift store paintings, comic greeting cards and many other pop culture forms. Skarstedt, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 737-2060, through April 1. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea 'MetLife' The curator and publisher Geoffrey Young has organized an enthralling show of small works by 12 artists who favor exacting craftsmanship and surrealistic imagination. Some, like Oona Ratcliffe, Cary Smith and Patricia Fabricant, tend toward abstraction; others, like Chris Zitelli and Morgan Bulkeley, create dreamlike narrative and symbolic images. Morgan Lehman, 317 10th Avenue, near 28th Street, (212) 268-6699, through April 1. (Johnson) * William Nicholson Though less well-known than his son, the British abstract painter Ben Nicholson, Sir William Nicholson was a successful artist in his day. The mostly small landscapes, portraits and Chardinesque still lifes in this beautiful show offer transporting fusions of paint and imagery. Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, through March 25. (Johnson) Other Galleries * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) THE STUDIO VISIT The studio visit, a time-honored ritual that everyone in the art world has both endured and learned from, is taken to its limit in Exit Art's latest exhibition marathon. Each of the 160 mostly short videos represents one artist's idea of, play on, or substitute for, a studio visit. It is a show that often cries out for a fast-forward button, but there are some notable gems -- for example, by Joyce Pensato, Cynthia von Buhler, Ida Applebroog, Bruce Pearson, Lance Wakeling, Taylor McKimens, Paul Wirhun, Elisabeth Kley, Christy Gast and Kim Jones. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 966-7745, through March 25. (Smith) 'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Fran\u00e7oise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson) Last Chance Stan Brodsky 'Evidence of Things' At 80, this painter, based in Huntington, N.Y., is making abstractions of uncommon liveliness and material richness. With their craggy, calligraphic forms glowing and flickering against fields of lush, generously applied color, Mr. Brodsky's paintings evoke the idea of an Abstract Expressionist who traded in his angst for hedonistic jouissance. June Kelly, 591 Broadway, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 226-1660; closes Tuesday. (Johnson) * DAVID DUPUIS/JESSICA JACKSON HUTCHINS In complementary shows, Mr. Dupuis cultivates his Surrealist-Symbolist penchant for small, visionary landscapes, while branching out into grotesquely detailed self-portraits, and Ms. Hutchins offers macabre spoofs of ceramics, social rituals and craftsmanship, with crudely made tea bowls and serving platters perched on topographically suggestive pedestals. Derek Eller Gallery, 615 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-6411; through tomorrow. (Smith) * RICHARD GREAVES: ANARCHITECTURE; MARIO DEL CURTO: PHOTOGRAPHS Mr. del Curto's sympathetic black-and-white photographs introduce Mr. Greaves's bristling huts and environments, built during the last decade in the wilds of Canada. Materials include parts of salvaged barns and farm houses joined with baling wire into sagging, swaying, psychologically potent forms that qualify as outsider architecture, site-specific installation art and settings for fairy tales -- especially those about witches. Andrew Edlin Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9723; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * DAINA HIGGINS In an art world knee-deep in feats of realism, these small paintings of urban scenes stand out. They are made with spray paint and stencils, based on photographs taken by the artist, a technique that gives the gritty subjects a transcendental immateriality, as if the world were made of varying tones of light. Elizabeth Harris Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-9666; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Jerry Kearns: 'Forever More' For many years Mr. Kearns has been making illustrative paintings combining Pop-Surrealist style, leftist politics and anti-consumerist social commentary, with humor and obviousness often battling to a draw. His new paintings feature muscle-bound Jesus figures, hysterical hermaphrodites, creepy children, magical birds, fast-food products and heavenly blue skies. Michael Steinberg, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-5770; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Shinique Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500; closes Sunday.
