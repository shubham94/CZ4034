The answer, which often elicits a gasp, is you should consume as much calcium as there is in five glasses of milk. Few Americans, at least few adult Americans, come anywhere near that level of calcium intake. And the statistics on osteoporosis and broken bones show that we are paying a high price for our neglect of this vital nutrient. In just a few years osteoporosis, a disease once unheard of by most women, has become a common concern. And well it should be, among young as well as older women. For this debilitating bone disorder, which is virtually epidemic among American women past the age of 60, has its roots in young adulthood. Prevention should start as early as the teen years. Depending upon how long they live, up to 40 percent of American women develop osteoporosis, the first sign of which is usually a broken bone or collapsed vertebra. While men are not immune to this problem, for various reasons - especially the hormonal changes that accompany menopause - women are much more likely to develop it. After menopause, the average American woman loses an inch and a half in height each decade as a result of vertebral collapse. Far more serious, millions of fractures and tens of thousands of deaths occur annually because of osteoporosis.", "snippet": "A QUESTION often asked, especially by women, is, ''How much milk should I drink every day to get enough calcium?''
