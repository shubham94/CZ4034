Now, in the age of AIDS, patients and their advocates say that the law could also be used to force the Government to release manuscripts and research data before they are published in medical journals.

Before the Government advises women on drug treatment, the advocates say, it should provide evidence that the treatment works for women, who may have different symptoms. But the National Institutes of Health is just as determined not to let people see papers before they appear in medical journals.", "headline": {"main": "The Nation; Patients and Scientists Fight for Control Of Medical Information"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": 1340, "_id": "4fd1a71a8eb7c8105d6c1b50", "snippet": "IN an attempt to make it harder for the Government to conduct its business in secret, Congress passed the Freedom of Information Act in 1966.
