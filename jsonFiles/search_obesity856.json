But America's weight problem has less to do with holiday binges than with everyday choices and circumstances. That's especially true for children, who are gaining weight in epidemic numbers, particularly in minority communities. Mexican-American and African-American children are twice as likely as non-Hispanic white children to have a body mass index of more than 25, the definition of overweight. In the last three decades, the number of overweight young Americans has tripled, with no sign the trend is abating. Far from being just the stuff of cruel schoolyard taunts, the issue has serious long-term implications. For the first time, children are being diagnosed with weight-related chronic ailments that usually strike much later in life, including hypertension and Type 2 diabetes, popularly known as adult-onset diabetes -- a name that now needs rethinking. These diseased children are at risk, as similarly stricken adults are, for heart and kidney troubles, blindness and limb amputation, but at an earlier age. Further, as odd as it seems, a number of these children suffer from malnutrition from the unhealthy diets that made them fat. As they age, they can be expected to strain the health care system.", "snippet": "That Americans are getting heavier is especially hard to deny the day after Thanksgiving.
