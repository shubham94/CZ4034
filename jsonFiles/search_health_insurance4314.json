SPEED LIMITS -- The House voted, 313 to 112, to repeal the Federal speed limit of 55 miles per hour for all vehicles, turning the question of what limits, if any, there should be on motorists over to the states. The law mandating Federal speed limits was passed 21 years ago at the height of an energy crisis. The Clinton Administration has said it opposes abolishing the 55 m.p.h. limit. The differences in the House and Senate bill still must be resolved.
