Critics have denounced some of the housing, poverty and job training programs of President Johnson as misguided, counterproductive or wasteful. But the two medical programs have been spared such harsh treatment, and Congress has authorized a modest expansion of benefits even in the current climate of fiscal austerity. Medicare, the program for the elderly, and Medicaid, for the poor, have had a tremendous impact on health care in this country, revolutionizing the industry, many believe. The two programs significantly increased Americans' access to hospitals, doctors and nursing homes.", "headline": {"main": "MEDICAL CARE PLANS CREATED IN THE 60'S KEEP WIDE SUPPORT"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2740, "_id": "4fd14d4c8eb7c8105d62c71a", "snippet": "Of all the Great Society programs enacted two decades ago, Medicare and Medicaid, which provide health benefits to the elderly and the poor, probably retain the strongest bipartisan support.

The conclusions were based on findings in 20 studies conducted since 1972, according to a spokesman for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Addressing the annual convention of the organization at the Convention Center in Washington yesterday, Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, said that women who use spermicides and birth control pills after they become pregnant but before they realize it do not increase the chances that their children will be born with defective hearts or limbs or other chromosomal abnormalities. Spermicides, which are available in a variety of gels, creams and foams and are used in conjunction with other forms of birth control or by themselves, have become a cause of public concern his year. In January, a Federal judge in Georgia awarded $5.1 million to a woman who testified that she was using a contraceptive gel manufactured by the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation when she became pregnant. She contended that the gel caused the baby she bore three years ago to be missing one arm and several fingers.
