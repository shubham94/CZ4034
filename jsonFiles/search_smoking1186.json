Winds carried radioactive fallout from dozens of these tests for hundreds of miles, exposing not only the soldiers assigned to maneuvers near ground zero, but distant civilian populations in surrounding states. Congressional investigations and scientific studies have suggested an association between the fallout exposure and illnesses among these groups, but the Government has consistently denied responsibility. This year, related lawsuits are forcing intense scrutiny of radiation and human health. In Salt Lake City last week, an epidemiologist testifying on behalf of 1,192 plaintiffs seeking damages for deaths and illnesses of relatives, said fallout was the probable cause of excess childhood leukemia deaths - in some areas more than three times higher than normal - in southern Utah. A former monitor of off-site radiation testified that his instruments ''went off the scale'' in a 1953 test when fallout drifted over that region. In Washington, Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming agreed to hold hearings of the Committee on Veterans Affairs to focus on whether the Pentagon and Veterans Administration withheld information on 250,000 servicemen who took part in atmospheric tests between 1945 and 1963. Four of these veterans announced last week that they would file claims against the Government and private laboratories in connection with the 1954 South Pacific test of a 15-megaton hydrogen bomb.", "snippet": "BETWEEN 1951 and 1958, at least 97 atomic bombs were detonated above-ground in the Nevada desert.
