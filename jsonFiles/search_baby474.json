Fryer Jr. is 27 years old and he is an assistant professor of economics at Harvard and he is black. Yes, 27 is young to be any kind of professor anywhere. But after what might charitably be called a slow start in the scholarly life, Fryer has been in a big hurry to catch up. He was in fact only 25 when he went on the job market, gaining offers from -- well, just about everywhere. He abruptly ended his job search by accepting an invitation to join the Society of Fellows at Harvard, one of academia's most prestigious research posts. This meant he wouldn't be teaching anywhere for three years. The Harvard economics department told Fryer to take its offer anyway; he could have an office and defer his teaching obligation until the fellowship was done. Now that he is halfway through his fellowship, the quality and breadth of Fryer's research have surprised even his champions. ''As a pure technical economic theorist, he's of the first rate,'' says Lawrence Katz, a prominent labor economist at Harvard. ''But what's really incredible is that he's also much more of a broad social theorist -- talking to psychologists, sociologists, behavioral geneticists -- and the ideas he comes up with aren't the 'let's take the standard economic model and push a little harder' ideas. He makes you think of Nathan Glazer or William Julius Wilson, but with economic rigor.'' Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard humanities scholar, says that Fryer is ''destined to be a star. I mean, he's a star already, just a baby star. I think he'll raise the analysis of the African-American experience to new levels of rigor and bring economics into the mainstream area of inquiry within the broader field of African-American studies.''", "headline": {"main": "Toward a Unified Theory of Black America"}, "abstract": "Stephen J Dubner profile of Roland G Fryer Jr, 27-year-old Harvard economist who is focusing his research on why blacks are not doing as well as other ethnic groups in America and what can be done to improve their condition; notes that Fryer, who is black, appreciates that he can raise questions that most white scholars would not dare; says Fryer's role model is W E B DuBois, black scholar and writer, who he says alone had appetite to rigorously collect and study facts and concepts and emotions that constitute race; notes that Fryer came from broken home in Daytona Beach, Fla, and that 8 of his 10 closest family members either died young or spent time in prison, including his father; photos (L)", "print_page": "54", "word_count": 5711, "_id": "4fd2a64a8eb7c8105d88e2b3", "snippet": "Roland Fryer says he wants to use the tools of economics to figure out where African-Americans \"went wrong\" \u0097 starting with his own family.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/20/magazine/20HARVARD.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2005/03/16/magazine/harvard.7575.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/03/16/magazine/harvard.7575.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55, "height": 55}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "FRYER, ROLAND G JR"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DUBOIS, W E B"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "HARVARD UNIVERSITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BLACKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ECONOMICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DISCRIMINATION"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Stephen", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "Dubner", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By Stephen J.
