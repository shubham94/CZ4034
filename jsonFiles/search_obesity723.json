The survey, to be presented tomorrow at the opening general session of the conference, shows that the effectiveness of campaigns that agencies produce for marketers is deteriorating, said J. Walker Smith, president at Yankelovich, because ''negative perceptions about advertising have substantially increased.''", "snippet": "AS the kingpins of Madison Avenue gather for a major annual meeting, there is further evidence of the growing challenge they confront in seeking to break through the cacophony of advertising that surrounds -- and increasingly annoys -- consumers.   ...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "ADVERTISING (TIMES COLUMN)", "name": "creative_works"}, {"value": "AMERICAN ASSN OF ADVERTISING AGENCIES", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "YANKELOVICH PARTNERS", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "PUBLIC OPINION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "MARKET RESEARCH", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "ADVERTISING AND MARKETING", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "CONSUMER BEHAVIOR", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "8", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 1033, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}, {"news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "document_type": "article", "_id": "4fd27d538eb7c8105d844bd8", "headline": {"kicker": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 4-11-04", "main": "Are the Kids All Right?"}, "pub_date": "2004-04-11T00:00:00Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"original": "By Ann Hulbert", "person": [{"lastname": "Hulbert", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Ann", "organization": "", "role": "reported"}]}, "abstract": "Ann Hulbert article questions methodology of Child Well-Being Index newly unveiled by Duke University and Foundation for Child Development researchers; index seeks to quantify key quality-of-life issues and assess progress or problems by comparing numbers over time; finds children fared 5 percent better in 2003 than in 1975; photos (M)", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/11/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-4-11-04-are-the-kids-all-right.html", "section_name": "Magazine", "lead_paragraph": "It's 2004.

You may scratch your head. What about three decades of family instability, to say nothing of bullying, binge drinking, A.D.D. and obesity -- the epidemics we're warned about these days? Or perhaps you're puzzled that improvement has been so meager. After all, the mid-1970's were the dark days before car seats and bike helmets and scheduled activities. Back then, hapless parents couldn't even be relied on to wonder where their children were at 10 p.m. without a public service announcement to remind them. By contrast, vigilant adults in the new millennium are keeping ever closer tabs on kids -- a quest that has inspired a surge in tracking devices, from nanny cams to No Child Left Behind standards and now the latest macro-indicator, the C.W.I.", "snippet": "It's 2004.
