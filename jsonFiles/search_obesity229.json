(HBO) THE WEIGHT OF THE NATION More than two-thirds of the adults in the United States and one-third of children are overweight, leading to an increase in deaths from heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, stroke and kidney disease. This four-part documentary -- a collaboration by HBO, the Institute of Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health -- is at the center of a public health campaign that includes a book, a social media component and an effort to reach more than 40,000 community groups. Part 3, ''Children in Crisis,'' looks at the struggle of overweight children and at their medical issues; above, a middle school gym class in Austin, Tex. It also examines school lunch standards and the debate over the definition of good nutrition among food and beverage makers, researchers and the government. The conclusion, ''Challenges,'' at 9:10, explores factors behind the obesity epidemic, including subsidized agriculture, evolutionary biology, racial and socioeconomic disparities, physical inactivity and the strong influence of the food and beverage industry. ''It wouldn't surprise me if people look back on the early part of the 21st century and call this the obesity era,'' says Dr. Thomas Farley, the New York City health commissioner. 9 A.M. (Sundance) ENCOUNTERS AT THE END OF THE WORLD (2008) For this documentary Werner Herzog traveled to Antarctica, where he met scientists and journeymen at the American outpost McMurdo Station and the penguins, seals, clams and jellyfish that surround them on what might as well be another planet. ''Few filmmakers make the end of days seem as hauntingly beautiful as Werner Herzog does, or as inexorable,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. One of the film's beauties, Ms. Dargis said, ''is that all the furry and floating animals are no more wondrous than the bipeds tramping through and around McMurdo: the linguist turned philosopher, the banker turned bus driver, and the female adventurer who, for drama and odd entertainment, likes to have herself zipped up in a carryall bag. (She's her own baggage.) Mr. Herzog opens his mind, heart and eyes to all these wayfarers who -- despite the persistent strain of melancholy that touches each and every person who appears on camera -- seem eerily at peace at the bottom of the world.'' The film received an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature.", "snippet": "8 P.M.
