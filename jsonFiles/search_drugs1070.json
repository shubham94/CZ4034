Members of the medical staff raced through hallways and down littered back stairwells toward the emergency room. \"Get them to send some boot covers down from the O.R.!\" a doctor called out. The cramped space, crowded with residents yelling and hauling equipment, resembled the engine room of a submarine. Oxygen tanks were piled by the door. Canisters of atropine, a drug used to control muscle spasms, were stacked in metal carts. Everyone donned blue plastic coats, masks with Plexiglas shields, rubber gloves and boot covers, then turned toward the emergency-room door, waiting for casualties to barrel through. This was only a drill. The staff was bracing to treat victims of a simulated sarin-gas attack on the New York subway system like the one that terrified Tokyo last March. Every six months, emergency personnel descend on Bellevue to test the city's response system. Each time the script changes to keep pace with natural disasters and terrorist innovations. In 1993, only minutes after the World Trade Center exploded, the same gong sounded for real as 110 critically injured patients were rushed to the emergency room. During today's drill the staff fell silent as a doctor ran in from the ambulance bay. \"Our victims are getting cold,\" he said. \"Can we bring out 10 blankets?\"", "headline": {"main": "Bellevue's Emergency"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "45", "word_count": 6903, "_id": "4fd206358eb7c8105d76edcb", "snippet": "AT 9 O'CLOCK ONE RECENT morning, an emergency gong resounded throughout Bellevue Hospital.
