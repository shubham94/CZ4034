Columbia University Medical Center and its Board of Visitors mourn the passing of the board's esteemed member, George Allen Mebane IV. Mr. Mebane, who also was a member of the ColumbiaPresbyterian Health Sciences Advisory Council, will be remembered for his intelligence, wit, generosity, and genuine compassion for others. Mr. Mebane brought to Columbia University Medical Center his deep knowledge of business as a leader in the textiles industry, first as cofounder, CEO, and chairman of two firms, Throwing Corporation of America and Universal Textured Yarns, then as co-founder, CEO, and chairman of Unifi Inc., a North Carolina manufacturer of nylon and polyester that became the largest producer and processor of textured yarns in the world, with plants in the United States, England, Brazil, and Ireland. Mr. Mebane retired in 2000 to focus on his philanthropic interests and established the Mebane Charitable Foundation, which supports education and learning technology initiatives. As a generous benefactor of CUMC's College of Physicians & Surgeons, he was a lead supporter of the Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, and provided major support to Cardiology, Ophthalmology, and Urology. His counsel and financial gifts to Columbia provide a legacy that will serve as a reminder of his many contributions toward our work in education, patient care, and research. We extend our condolences to his wife, Marianne, his children, and other family members.
