At the same time, mathematicians are charting the invisible streams and eddies of blood flow through the heart's chambers by applying advanced computer techniques ordinarily used in aerodynamic design with the intention of improving the technology of artificial heart valves. [ Page C3. ] In effect, these groups of scientists are exploring the dynamical heart: a complex, moving system of electrical triggers, oscillating muscles and fluid flows that performs as more than the sum of its parts. The scientists are trying to use improved knowledge to improve surgical and drug techniques that now must often be worked out by trial and error. And they are finding that the overall behavior of the heart cannot always be deduced merely from details of cell activity or chemical processes. The most important results so far apply to the problem of fibrillation, the irregular, frenzied heartbeat that brings immediate death to hundreds of thousands of people in this country each year. In about half of those cases, fibrillation is caused by the best-known heart problem: blockage of the arteries leading to the death of the pumping muscle. But in the other half, the cause of fibrillation remains mysterious.", "headline": {"main": "COMPUTERS ATTACK HEART DISEASE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1840, "_id": "4fd165618eb7c8105d652898", "snippet": "CROSSING the traditional lines between disciplines, biologists in the United States and Canada are borrowing from computer science and theoretical physics to achieve a new understanding of the normal and abnormal rhythms of the heart that make the...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/05/science/computers-attack-heart-disease.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "HEART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DATA PROCESSING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "James", "lastname": "GLEICK"}], "original": "By JAMES GLEICK"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1986-08-05T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Science; Health"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Real Estate Desk", "lead_paragraph": "FROM Morningside Park to the Harlem River, 116th Street in Harlem is showing signs of improvement, shaking off the lethargy of a sinking throughfare in the west and building upon the already bustling economic life of the east. Long considered one of Harlem's most stable commercial strips, 116th Street suffered tremendously in the 1970's. The housing abandonment that swept across many poorer communities took a heavy toll on surrounding streets, and the troubles of crime, arson and drug trafficking added to the problem. It has been a long trip back for all those communities and their commercial hubs. Some have come back farther and faster, a point made clear by the diversity of 116th Street itself, where the eastern section long ago recovered a Spanish-flavored vibrancy while the western part lagged. Now both sections are gaining both in residential and commercial investment as entrepreneurs put in more of their own capital.", "headline": {"main": "Harlem's 116th Street Struggling Back"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2088, "_id": "4fd16bd98eb7c8105d65d4c6", "snippet": "FROM Morningside Park to the Harlem River, 116th Street in Harlem is showing signs of improvement, shaking off the lethargy of a sinking throughfare in the west and building upon the already bustling economic life of the east.
