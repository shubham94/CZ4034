WARSAW - Behind the workers' revolt that began with strikes in the summer of 1980 and grew to a revolution on the shoulders of the Solidarity union, the operation of which was suspended when martial law was declared, lies a story of failure. It is the failure of Communism, in the eyes of the workers, to deliver on its promise of a better life. The revolt sprang from an unspoken consensus among Poles that despite more than three decades of sacrifice and toil, conditions of everyday life were scarcely improving and that the Communist system had failed most dramatically in precisely those areas, in the realm of social welfare, where its ideology called for greater exertion and improvement. Appalling dirt and safety conditions in factories, cramped and unavailiable appartments, substandard and sloppy health care, lines in front of meat shops - food shortages in general despite a stringent rationing system - these were the distingushing traits of what the Government referred to as ''people's Poland.'' They were glossed over, ignored or denied by successive governments that pressed instead for higher production statistics in heavy industry.", "headline": {"main": "COMMUNISM AND BETTER LIFE: POLES FOUND WAIT TOO LONG"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 3935, "_id": "4fd11c358eb7c8105d5d90ff", "snippet": "John Darnton, who has been chief of The New York Times bureau in Warsaw since September 1979, reports in the following article on the problems underlying the crisis in Poland.

This steep rise in New Jersey's Caesarean birth rate, which parallels the nationwide upward curve, has led many to ask whether the procedure is performed too frequently today.
