What does that mean?'' The questioner was not sure whether to worry. He is one of many thousands of people who periodically have a triglyceride measurement taken as part of a routine health checkup; if all Americans were tested at least one in 20 would be found to have triglyceride, or fat, levels in their blood that are generally regarded as ''too high.'' His concern was only partly relieved when he was told that his doctor was also probably uncertain about the importance of elevated triglycerides. The debate about triglycerides makes the cholesterol controversy seem like an open-and-shut case. High triglyceride levels in the blood are unquestionably associated with increased risk of developing heart and blood vessel diseases. The debate turns on whether triglycerides directly contribute to the artery-clogging disease atherosclerosis or whether they are only an indicator for other factors that do the damage more directly. If they are merely an indicator, then some experts question the need to institute treatment to bring elevated levels to normal. While scientists and physicians argue the issue, it pays, for the sake of your health and peace of mind, to bypass the debate and try to understand the causes and potential significance of high triglyceride levels.", "snippet": "''THE doctor said my cholesterol was O.K. but my triglycerides were too high.
