La'Tanya was 13, Tichelle was 11 and, along with their two younger sisters, they had recently returned from a year in foster care to live with their mother, Jean. (I have used middle names to protect the family's privacy.) I was supposed to spend an hour or two with them and write an article for the paper about families that reunite. But I liked the girls, and I decided I needed to interview them again -- the joy of being an intern, after all, is that no one really cares when you finish your article. The next time I showed up, about a week later, a worried-looking woman was talking to the girls. She was a prosecutor who was about to try Jean's boyfriend, Earl Osborn, for sexually abusing La'Tanya and Tichelle over several years and their 7-year-old sister, Charnelle, for a shorter period. The girls were her chief witnesses.", "headline": {"main": "A Question of Resilience"}, "abstract": "Emily Bazelon article on study of what allows some children to escape long-term ravages of sexual abuse; focuses on research into interplay between variations of particular gene, 5-HTT, and environment, which may not only account for such resilience, but also lead to treatment; photos (L)`", "print_page": "54", "word_count": 4979, "_id": "4fd2879d8eb7c8105d859797", "snippet": "Why are certain children able to cope with sexual abuse while most others fall apart?
