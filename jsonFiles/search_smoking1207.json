ALTMAN FOR more than 25 years, American doctors have been noting a pronounced and puzzling decline in the incidence of peptic ulcers - the sores on the lining of the stomach and the small intestines that cause gnawing pains and can lead to potentially fatal complications. And in recent years, studies have shown an even sharper drop in the number of operations on ulcer victims in the United States and other countries. In fact, plans to conduct a recent study in 14 Veterans Administration hospitals to determine the effectiveness of a certain surgical treatment of duodenal ulcers had to be canceled because there were not enough patients to make a valid study, according to the American Medical Association. Doctors are not required to report cases of peptic ulcers, and therefore assumptions about their incidence are extrapolated from statistics collected in surveys and studies. However, from such studies a downward trend in the incidence of peptic ulcers began to appear about 1955 in the United States and some European countries, and no one has isolated the reason - or reasons - from among the numerous possible explanations.", "snippet": "ILLNESS By LAWRENCE K.
