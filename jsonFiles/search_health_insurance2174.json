Anthony L. Watson, CEO and Chair, the Board of Directors and staff of EmblemHealth, the parent company of HIP Health Insurance Plan of New York and GHI, mourn the passing of Ronald Maiorana, a retired senior vice president of public affairs and a consultant to EmblemHealth at the time of his death. A former reporter for the New York Times and later press secretary and advisor to New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, he was 78 and died Thursday after a short illness at his home in East Quogue. Mr. Maiorana joined The Times as a copy boy in 1951 as a college freshman in night school and was promoted to reporter in 1955, covering a broad range of assignments in the New York metropolitan area and in Albany. He left The Times in 1968 to join Governor Rockefeller as an assistant press secretary. In 1969, the Governor appointed Mr. Maiorana as his press secretary and principal spokesperson. He accompanied the Governor on government and political trips across the nation and throughout South America. After Governor Rockefeller left office, Mr. Maiorana served as New York State Commissioner of Wagering Systems (1974-1975). He then joined the New York State Special Prosecutor for the Criminal Justice System as a director (1975-1976). He later worked with political consultants David Garth and Maureen Connelly on the U.S. Senate campaign of H. John Heinz of Pennsylvania and on all of Rudolph Giulianis campaigns for Mayor of New York City. He joined the administration of Mayor Giuliani as a senior advisor in 1994 and was appointed Commissioner of the New York City Community Assistance Unit in 1995. He left his city position to join HIP as a managing consultant for public affairs in 1996 and joined the health care company's executive staff full time in 1998. He retired April 30, 2007. At HIP, he was a trusted advisor to CEO Anthony L. Watson during a period of profound change in the firm, culminating with the affiliation with GHI to form EmblemHealth earlier this year. Mr. Maiorana also was a talented artist, an avocation he pursued for 60 years, opening his first exhibit AbstRactions in July. Two of his abstracts on canvas are in the Nelson Rockefeller collection. The EmblemHealth family extends its prayers and best wishes to Mr. Maiorana's family: his son Ronald Peter Maiorana and wife, Kelly Allman, and daughters Linda Catherine Williams and her husband Trevor Williams, and Janice Virginia Maiorana-Browne, and her husband Christopher Browne, and Mr. Maiorana's brother Victor and his wife, Rosalie. His wife, Phyllis, was killed accidentally when struck by a branch that fell from a tree on September 11, 2002. They had been married 47 years.
