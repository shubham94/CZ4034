The unusual strain of mouse carries a kind of trigger near the gene that determines not only the color of its coat but also its predisposition to obesity, diabetes and cancer. When pregnant mice were fed extra vitamins and supplements, the supplements interacted with the trigger in the fetal mice and shut down the gene. As a result, obese yellow mothers gave birth to standard brown baby mice that grew up lean and healthy.", "headline": {"main": "A Pregnant Mother's Diet May Turn the Genes Around"}, "abstract": "Dr Randy Jirtle, Duke University professor of radiation oncology and senior investigator of study published in Molecular and Cellular Biology, explains how pregnant mother's diet can change offspring without changing genes themselves; science of environmental factors influencing gene function is known as epigenetics; drawing, photo (L)", "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1606, "_id": "4fd231548eb7c8105d7c0ad1", "snippet": "With the help of some fat yellow mice, scientists have discovered exactly how a mother's diet can permanently alter the functioning of genes in her offspring without changing the genes themselves.
