Now a report in The Journal of Nutrition suggests that eating meat, dairy products and protein bars containing the amino acid leucine after intense exercise also significantly cuts down on the time muscles need to recover, at least in rats. During exercise, some of the protein that makes up muscles is broken down, preventing them from working fully. But leucine, an amino acid, or protein component, appears to spark the first step in creating, or synthesizing, protein, leading to muscle renewal. ''Our research shows that consuming food with leucine after exercising starts the recovery process right away,'' said Dr. Donald K. Layman, an exercise scientist at the University of Illinois. ''The quicker an exerciser recovers, the sooner he or she can operate at peak capacity.
