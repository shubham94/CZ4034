Beginning in 1949, more than 5,200 Framingham residents have participated in a unique study that has shown how living habits like smoking and inactivity, and health factors like obesity and high blood pressure, influence a person's chances of developing and dying of cardiovascular diseases, the nation's leading killers. For the last two decades, 5,100 of the children of the original participants have also been studied, carrying the Framingham work into an era when deaths from heart attacks and strokes have fallen sharply while the costs of cardiovascular care continue to soar.", "snippet": "NO anatomical or surgical study has revealed more about the health of the American heart than the four-decade-long project involving the people of Framingham, Mass.
