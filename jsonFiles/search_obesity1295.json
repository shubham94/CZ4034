One of these is laser therapy for an insidious disorder called diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of new cases of blindness among American adults. Some 600,000 people already have early stages of this condition and could lose their sight if it is not detected and promptly treated. Each year, diabetic retinopathy renders some 5,000 diabetics legally blind, at least half of them unnecessarily. When the disorder is diagnosed early and treated with laser therapy, useful vision can often be preserved. Yet a study in Wisconsin two years ago found that 62 percent of diabetics never had the eye examination necessary to detect retinopathy. In 1979, two years after the benefits of laser therapy were clearly demonstrated in a well-publicized national study, two-thirds of family physicians and half of internists surveyed in Michigan were unaware of the study and its implications for the prevention of blindness in diabetics.", "snippet": "A TRAGEDY of modern medical care is that, even in an age of virtually instant communication, it often takes years to get the word out about new life- and limb-saving treatments to the people who could most benefit from them.
