These so-called hybrid plans are now the fastest-growing kind of health plan, with almost 10 million members by last month, more than double the number just two and a half years earlier. Employers are counting on them to bring the most reluctant of their workers into the world of managed care; indeed, many small and medium-sized companies are now offering their employees a hybrid plan and nothing else.
