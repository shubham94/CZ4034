Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Now Playing * ''BUKOWSKI: BORN INTO THIS.'' Directed by John Dullaghan. (Not rated, 113 minutes). This definitive, deeply engrossing film biography of the famously scrappy, hard-drinking poet Charles Bukowski, who died in 1984, combines interviews, many done for European television, with the reminiscences of former drinking buddies, fellow writers and his second wife, Linda, the keeper of his flame. The portrait that emerges is of a cantankerous misanthrope zestfully living out his legend as a profane realist and professional lowlife, whose lean, brutal literary style allowed no sentimentality. He wryly credits his abusive childhood in which his father regularly beat him for no reason as having helped form his style. Without straining, the film makes a strong case for Bukowski as a major American poet whose work was a slashing rebuke to polite academic formalism (Stephen Holden).", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film.
