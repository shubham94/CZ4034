Still, on a multitude of issues, deep gulfs divide them. Here are some examples. ROBERT PEAR FEDERAL BUDGET Clinton: Says a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget is wrong, because it would tie the hands of Congress and the President, and is not needed because both parties are already working to eliminate the deficit by 2002. Deficit declined to $107 billion in fiscal year 1996, from $290 billion in 1992. Dole: Favors a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget. Says his proposals would revitalize the economy and balance the budget by 2002, even while cutting taxes by $548 billion over six years. TAXES Clinton: Would not reduce income tax rates, but would give a tax credit of $500 for each child under the age of 13. Would make the full credit available to families with income up to $60,000 a year. Would reduce capital gains tax on sale of homes. Would offer a tax credit of $1,500 a year for the first two years of higher education. Would allow a tax deduction for higher education and job training costs up to $10,000 a year. Dole: Would reduce individual income tax rates by 15 percent across the board over three years. Would cut the top capital gains tax rate, to 14 percent from 28 percent. Would offer a tax credit of $500 for each child under 18. Would make the full credit available to couples with incomes up to $110,000 a year and single parents up to $75,000. Would reduce estate taxes. Would ''repeal the Clinton tax hike on Social Security benefits,'' which affects the more affluent elderly. Would rein in the Internal Revenue Service. ARTS Clinton: Supports National Endowment for the Arts. Lobbied successfully for ''V-chip'' technology in television sets, permitting parents to block shows deemed too violent or sexually explicit. Dole: Opposed creation of the National Endowment for the Arts and wants to eliminate it. Says Federal Government should not be actively involved in ''the culture business.'' Denounced movies and recordings with excessive sex and violence, saying they ''debase our nation.'' But opposed V-chip requirement and rating system because ''it takes us one step closer to Government control over what we see and hear on television.'' Said consumers should just ''turn off the trash.'' DEFENSE Clinton: Curbed military spending. Wants the Pentagon to develop a missile defense system, but would postpone a decision on whether to deploy it until at least 2000. Dole: Would deploy a military defense system by 2003 to protect States against ballistic missiles. Says President Clinton has cut military spending and capabilities too much. EDUCATION Clinton: Has proposed higher levels of Federal education spending than Mr. Dole favored. Opposes using public money for private school tuition, but would give students greater choice among public schools. Says two years of college should become ''just as universal'' as high school education is today. Favors school uniforms, as a way to promote school discipline. Says every classroom should be linked to Internet by 2000. Issued guidelines on religious activity in public schools, indicating that certain types of prayer may be allowed under current law. Dole: Would eliminate the Federal Department of Education and shift decision-making power to states. Would offer scholarships to students of elementary and secondary school age so they could attend private schools, including parochial schools. Wants to allow volutary prayer in public schools. Says, ''We must end the teachers unions' chokehold on public education.'' FOREIGN AFFAIRS Clinton: Says he has finally mastered foreign policy and established strong ties with world leaders. Boasts that he helped restore democracy in Haiti, stopped civil war in Bosnia, fostered peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors, sent warplanes to Iraq to punish Saddam Hussein. Supports expansion of NATO in 1999, but has not identified former Societ bloc countries to be admitted. Dole: Says Mr. Clinton conducts ''an ad hoc foreign policy,'' is indecisive and reactive, with no coherent strategy. Denounces ''weak policies, vacillation and abdication of U.S. leadership.'' Says Iraq and its army are stronger now than in 1993 because Mr. Clinton failed to maintain the international coalition against Saddam Hussein. Would let Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic join NATO in 1998. HEALTH Clinton: Proposed to guarantee health insurance for all Americans with costly, complex scheme that was rejected by Congress in 1994. Recently signed a more modest measure to make health insurance available to millions of Americans who change jobs or lose their jobs. Defended Medicaid, saying Republicans wanted to eliminate the Federal guarantee of coverage for the poor, blind and disabled. Vetoed Republican bill to revamp Medicare, saying it would devastate program for the elderly. Promises not to increase costs for Medicare beneficiaries. Dole: Opposed Mr. Clinton's 1993 proposal, saying it would lead to a Government takeover of the health care system. Wants to slow the growth of Medicare, but would still allow substantial increases in Federal spending. Says Mr. Clinton has frightened the elderly with ''Medi-scare tactics.'' Seeks much more state control over Medicaid. Favors tax breaks for medical savings accounts, so people have more health care choices. ABORTION Clinton: Supports broad abortion rights. Says: ''The decision to have an abortion should be between a woman, her doctor and her faith. Abortions should be safe, legal and rare.'' Has aggressively enforced new law that makes it a crime to block access to abortion clinics. Vetoed a bill to ban a specific type of late-term abortion, saying the measure did not meet constitutional requirements to protect the life and health of pregnant women. Dole: Opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of a pregnant woman. Opposed the 1973 decision of the Supreme Court that established a right to abortion. Says, ''I support a constitutional amendment to restrict abortion, subject to the exceptions of life of the mother, rape and incest.'' Supported legislation to ban certain late-term abortion procedures. ENVIRONMENT Clinton: Opposes bill to require rigorous cost-benefit analysis of new regulations. Would give businesses more flexibility if they do a better job of cleaning up the environment. Opposes Republican efforts to compensate property owners for loss of property value resulting from regulation. Says such legislation ''would cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars and weaken safeguards for public health, safety and the environment.'' Blocked Republican proposal to open Arctic Wildlife Refugee to oil drilling. Dole: Says businesses are over-regulated. Would establish rigorous test to determine if benefits of new regulations are worth the costs. Would compensate property owners when regulations reduce the value of their property. Supported bill to open Arctic Wildlife Refugee to oil drilling. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION Clinton: Says, ''Mend it, don't end it.'' Opposes California ballot measure, Proposition 209, which would prohibit racial and sexual preferences in public employment, education and contracts. Dole: Says that 30 years of affirmative action programs were ''a blind alley in the search for equal justice.'' Once supported some types of affirmative action, but now says many such programs are misguided because they polarize society, pitting one group against another. Introduced legislation to prohibit most Federal preferences based on race or sex. Supports Proposition 209 to ban preferences based on race or sex in public employment and education in California. IMMIGRATION Clinton: Favors continued access to public education for children who are illegal immigrants. Boasts of increasing the Border Patrol and increasing deportations of illegal immigrants. Wants to reduce legal immigration ''by a moderate amount.'' Opposes making English the official language of the United States. Dole: Supports a proposal to let states deny public education to illegal immigrants. Favors ''a modest, temporary reduction in the annual rate of legal immigration.'' Would declare English the official language. TERM LIMITS Clinton: Opposes a constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms that can be served by members of Congress. Dole: Wants to establish a two-term limit for United States senators and a six-term limit for members of the House of Representatives. GUN CONTROL Clinton: Has often defied National Rifle Association. Won ban on certain semiautomatic assault weapons as part of 1994 crime law. Favors extension of 1993 Brady law to prevent people who commit acts of domestic violence from buying guns. Dole: Opposes most gun controls. Opposed 1994 law banning certain assault weapons. Says ''the ban on assault weapons has not been very effective,'' but is not pushing for repeal. Wants to establish an ''instant check'' system to check the background of prospective gun-buyers, so criminals could not purchase firearms. DRUG ABUSE Clinton: Boasts of tough drug policies, including a measure authorizing greater use of death penalty for drug dealers. Says spending on drug enforcement has increased in recent years. Would require teen-agers to pass a drug test before getting drivers' licenses. Dole: Says he would ''restore the war on drugs as a top budget and policy priority.'' Holds Mr. Clinton responsible for an increase in drug use among teen-agers. CRIME Clinton: Won major anticrime package that included money for more local police officers and more prisons. Endorses juvenile curfews. Supports constitutional amendment to increase rights of crime victims. Dole: Favors prosecuting violent youths as adults. Would double Federal aid to states for prison construction. Would require Federal prisoners to work at least 40 hours a week. WELFARE Clinton: Promised to ''end welfare as we know it'' in 1992 campaign. Vetoed two Republican bills as harsh to children. After sending mixed signals this year, signed a third bill that shifts power to the states, ending the 60-year-old Federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children. Says he wants to restore benefits to legal immigrants and reverse food stamp cuts. Dole: Supports the new Federal welfare law, which eliminates individual entitlement and gives states vast new power to run their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of Federal money. Supports work requirements and five-year time limit in new law.", "headline": {"main": "A Guide to Where the Candidates Stand", "kicker": "POLITICS"}, "abstract": "Table of stands by Pres Clinton and Bob Dole on key issues; drawings", "print_page": "38", "word_count": 1673, "_id": "4fd1eddd8eb7c8105d74077d", "snippet": "During a combined total of more than 60 years in public office, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole have shown themselves adaptable politicians, more likely to cut deals than to insist on ideology.

INCUMBENT Robert E. Andrews, 39, of Haddon Heights, three-term Congressman. Elected in 1990 to succeed Jim Florio; member of the International Relations Committee and the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee. Former Camden County freeholder and lawyer. CHALLENGER Mel Suplee, (R), of Bellmawr; his 57th birthday is today. A retired Federal employee, he now works as a purchasing specialist for Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Has unsuccessfully run for mayor of Bellmawr and for state Senate. THE RACE The incumbent, who has his eye on the New Jersey State House, has little to worry about in this Democratic district. Republicans were forced to come up with a substitute candidate over the summer after the withdrawal of the candidate who had won the primary running unopposed. Crucial issues, according to Mr. Andrews, are protecting Medicare and protecting the environment. SECOND DISTRICT All of Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem counties. Part of Gloucester County and one municipality in Burlington County. INCUMBENT Frank LoBiondo, (R), 50, first-term Congressman from Vineland. Member of the Banking and Financial Services Committee and the Small Business Committee. Member of state Assembly from 1988 to 1994; operations manager for LoBiondo Brothers Motor Express, a family trucking company. CHALLENGER Ruth Katz, (D), 44, a lawyer from Ventnor. Former counsel to House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment. THE RACE Although Mr. LoBiondo is favored, Ms. Katz could be within striking distance, according to some independent political publications analyzing congressional races. The district was represented for many years by William J. Hughes, a Democrat. Calling health care a crucial issue, Ms. Katz says her priority would be to control Medicare costs and to promote long-term and nursing-home care. Ms. Katz, who has been endorsed by the New Jersey Environmental Federation, assails the Republican record on the environment, including protection of the New Jersey shore. Mr. LoBiondo, who has had several tough races in his political career, supported the changes in welfare policy approved by Congress and favors Republican measures to balance the budget. THIRD DISTRICT Parts of Burlington and Camden counties and southern Ocean County. INCUMBENT H. James Saxton, (R), 53, six-term Congressman from Southampton. Member ofe National Security Committee and Resources Committee; vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. Has worked in real estate and insurance and served in the state Assembly and Senate. CHALLENGER John Leonardi, (D), 40, of Cherry Hill Township. An Army officer for 14 years, he is now in the Army Reserves. President and chief executive of the Greater New Jersey Regional Multiple Listing Service. THE RACE This is a decidedly lopsided race, with Mr. Saxton firmly entrenched in a district that has voted Republican for many years. Mr. Leonardi, who was drafted by the Democrats when they could not persuade an experienced politician to run, has almost no campaign money. He does, however, have the backing of the New Jersey Education Association and the National Education Association. FOURTH DISTRICT Parts of Burlington, Mercer, Monmouth and Ocean counties. INCUMBENT Christopher H. Smith, (R), 43, eight-term Congressman from Washington Township. Member of Veterans' Affairs and International Relations committees. CHALLENGER Kevin J. Meara, 38, a former Hamilton Township councilman from 1990 to 1994. Marketing representative for P.S.E. & G. Ran unsuccessfully for the state Assembly as an independent in 1991. THE RACE Mr. Smith has easily won the last several races and seems destined to do so this year, when his opponent has almost no campaign money. Mr. Meara is hoping for a boost from Democrats who want to regain control of Congress. FIFTH DISTRICT Parts of Bergen, Passaic and Sussex counties and all of Warren County. INCUMBENT Marge S. Roukema, (R), 67; nine-term Congresswoman from Ridgewood, the longest-serving member of the New Jersey delegation. Member of Banking and Financial Services Committee and the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee. CHALLENGER Bill Auer, (D), 56, a former electrical engineer who now works in advertising. A resident of Allendale and a former member of the local planning board. THE RACE In an overwhelmingly Republican district, Mrs. Roukema has repeatedly easily won re-election. She received 74 percent of the vote against Mr. Auer in 1994. SIXTH DISTRICT Southern and middle Middlesex County and coastal Monmouth County. INCUMBENT Frank J. Pallone Jr., (D), 45, Long Branch. A lawyer specializing in maritime law, he was originally elected to Congress in 1988 to succeed the late James J. Howard. Member of Commerce Committee and Resources Committee. CHALLENGER Steven J. Corodemus, (R), 44, a lawyer who lives in Atlantic Highlands. Three-term state assemblyman. THE RACE Although Mr. Pallone is considered the leader, it is a hard-fought campaign. In Congress, Mr. Pallone has specialized in environmental and fishing issues, both important topics for coastal residents. Mr. Corodemus can also claim credit for state environmental legislation, including coastline protection. The candidates follow party lines in their disagreement on Bob Dole's proposed 15 percent tax cut. Mr. Pallone, who initially opposed abortion, now supports a woman's right to have an abortion and Mr. Corodemus opposes it. SEVENTH DISTRICT Parts of Middlesex, Somerset and Union counties and a bit of Essex County. INCUMBENT Robert D. Franks, (R), 45, a two-term Congressman from New Providence. Member of Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Budget Committee. Former member of state Assembly; former state Republican chairman. CHALLENGER Lawrence Lerner, (D), 61, a patent lawyer from Warren in Pohatcong Township. THE RACE Although the Seventh District has been represented by a Republican for nearly 25 years, there are more registered Democrats in its current configuration and Mr. Lerner has put $500,000 of his own money into his first race for public office. Although Mr. Franks won re-election by a healthy 59 percent of the vote two years ago, his predecessor, Matthew Rinaldo, won by 75 percent in his last race Mr. Lerner opposes cuts in Medicare spending, supports tax credits for college costs and opposes cuts in spending for environmental protection. Mr. Franks voted for the recent welfare bill and supports a balanced-budget amendment. He points to the bill signed by President Clinton to dredge the Ports of Newark and Elizabeth as one of his major accomplishments. EIGHTH DISTRICT Parts of Essex and Passaic counties. INCUMBENT William J. Martini, (R), 49, a one-term Congressman from Clifton and a lawyer. Member of Government Reform and Oversight Committee and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. CHALLENGER William Pascrell Jr., (D), 59, Mayor of Paterson since 1990; member of state Assembly since 1988. THE RACE One of the most hotly contested Congressional contests in the state, if not the nation. Both sides, with help from the national parties, could spend as much as $1 million. The city of Paterson is heavily Democratic, but it is surrounded by Republican-leaning suburbs and Mr. Martini won his first race by the slimmest of margins. Mr. Pascrell has not been shy about noting that Representative Martini has voted with Newt Gingrich more often than other Republican members of the New Jersey delegation, while Mr. Martini, describing Paterson as a deteriorating city, says Mayor Pascrell is at fault. NINTH DISTRICT Parts of Bergen and Hudson counties. Since 1982, Robert G. Torricelli has been Congressman. DEMOCRAT Steven R. Rothman, 44, of Fair Lawn. Former Mayor of Englewood; Bergen County Surrogate Court Judge. REPUBLICAN Kathleen A. Donovan, 44, of Lyndhurst. Former member of state Assembly; former chairwoman of Republican State Committee. Former chairwoman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, appointed by Governor Whitman. Bergen County Clerk, 1988 to 1996. THE RACE One of the most hotly contested, races in the state. One would think that Mr. Torricelli's hold on the district, plus President Clinton lead in the polls, would make this a gimme for the Democrats. But many believe Ms. Donovan has a good chance. She touts herself as a pro-choice, pro-environment, pro-gun-control politician and has won endorsements from groups that normally support Democrats, like the Sierra Club and the National Education Association. Mr. Rothman, who has the backing of many union and consumer groups, describes himself as a fiscally conservative, socially progressive Democrat who will stand up to House Speaker Newt Gingrich. 10TH DISTRICT Includes parts of Newark and Jersey City, plus suburbs in Essex and Union counties. INCUMBENT Donald Payne, (D), 62, four-term member of Congress from Newark. Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Former Essex County freeholder; former Newark Councilman. CHALLENGER Vanessa Williams, (R), 35, a lawyer from Newark. Former Essex County Superior Court clerk. THE RACE Mr. Payne is a popular incumbent in a heavily Democratic district. (In 1994, for example, he captured 76 percent of the vote.) Mr. Payne was one of the few Democrats to vote against President Clinton on the welfare bill. His opponent, Ms. Williams, is a political novice and member of a group called Concerned Black Republicans. She supports school choice, a balanced-budget amendment and welfare reform. 11TH DISTRICT Covering all of Morris County and bits of Essex, Passaic, Somerset and Sussex. INCUMBENT Rodney Frelinghuysen, (R), 50, first-term Congressman from Harding Township. Former Morris County freeholder and member of the state Assembly. CHALLENGER Chris Evangel, (D), 39, a vice president of Moody's Investors Service, who lives in Morris Township. Former member of Jersey City School Board and Jersey City Finance Committee; delegate, 1988 Democratic National Convention THE RACE Mr. Frelinghuysen, a member of one of New Jersey's most distinguished political families, would seem to have this one clinched: he is well known and won in 1994 with 71 percent of the vote. But Mr. Evangel has been buoyed by the endorsement of The Star-Ledger and is hoping for help from the coattails of President Clinton. Mr. Evangel has tried to link Mr. Frelinghuysen with (surprise, surprise) Speaker Newt Gingrich and accused Mr. Frelinghuysen of not doing enough to stop corporate downsizing in the district. Mr. Frelinghuysen, for his part, is counting on his reputation as a fiscal conservative and social moderate, his long-standing service in the district, plus a bevy of endorsements and from business, police and mental health groups. 12TH DISTRICT All of Hunterdon County and parts of Monmouth, Mercer and Middlesex. Richard A. Zimmer, who has represented the district since 1990, is running for Senate. DEMOCRAT David M. Del Vecchio, 40, the Mayor of Lambertville since 1991. Senior executive for economic development in the state Treasury Department since 1991; former acting executive director of the Essex County Improvement Authority. REPUBLICAN Mike Pappas, 35, of Rocky Hill. Somerset County Freeholder since 1984. Former Mayor of Franklin Township and former member of Franklin Township Council. Partner in family-owned insurance agency in Somerset. THE RACE Considered close. Democrats are upbeat because they believe that Mr. Pappas, an anti-abortion conservative who opposes the ban on assault weapons, is too far to the right for the district's moderate Republicans. Mr. Del Vecchio has been promoting himself as a centrist who would cut the capital gains tax and who supports the death penalty. Mr. Pappas has billed himself as an anti-tax crusader and says more responsibility should be shifted to states and towns. One problem for both candidates is that they are relatively unknown. 13TH DISTRICT Includes a chunk of Hudson County with slivers of Essex, Middlesex and Union. INCUMBENT Robert Menendez, (D), 42, two-term Congressman from Union City. Former Mayor of Union City; former member of state Assembly and Senate. CHALLENGER Carlos Munoz. (R), 50, a West New York resident who works at the Hudson County welfare office. Has run unsuccessfully for state offices for almost 15 years. THE RACE Mr. Menendez captured 71 percent of the vote in 1994, and Mr. Munoz has no money and no support from the party. Still, the race is drawing attention. That's because Mr. Munoz, a Cuban native who moved to the United States in 1972, may be the first Federal office seeker to campaign entirely in a foreign language. Mr. Munoz reads and write English just fine; it's just the speaking part that is tricky. So during a recent televised debate, Mr. Munoz (actually, Dr. Munoz, because he was a veterinarian in Cuba) sparred in Spanish with Mr. Menendez, who, though fluent in Spanish himself as New Jersey's first Hispanic House member, replied in English.", "headline": {"main": "Bound for Washington?
