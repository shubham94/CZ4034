He was 80 years old. The cause of death was leukemia. Kennedy was a prominent paper company executive who built Federal Paper Board Company of Montvale, New Jersey, into one of the nation's largest producers of paperboard. He joined Federal in 1952 after graduating from Georgetown University and spent his entire career with the company, serving as CEO from 1975 to 1996. He modernized and grew the company by making major investments in large paperboard and pulp mills in the South. Under his leadership, Federal's revenues increased from $175 million in 1974 to $1.9 billion in 1995, while earnings rose more than tenfold from $12 million to $142 million during the same period. In 1996, Kennedy negotiated the sale of the company to International Paper Company for $3.7 billion, providing a sizable return for Federal's shareholders. He was elected to the International Paper board of directors and continued to serve until he reached mandatory retirement age in 2002. He was also active in many educational and civic causes. He served on the board of directors of Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., from 1981 to 1987 and from 1993 to 2002. He was elected acting chair of the board in 1995 and served as chair from 1996 to 2002. He was a major financial contributor to the university. Kennedy Hall, which provides housing for Georgetown students, is named for him and his wife, Elizabeth. In addition, he was a former director of the Foreign Policy Association, the American Forest & Paper Association and the Duke University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and a former member of the board of governors of the United Nations Association of the United States of America. He was heavily involved with Pathfinder Village and a founder of the Kennedy-Willis Center on Down Syndrome. In 1997, he co-founded the nonprofit East Hampton Healthcare Foundation to provide medical care for the people of East Hampton, New York, where he had a summer home. The foundation operates a health care center and urgent-care walk-in facility. He was former vice chairman of the Indian River Medical Center Foundation, which raises funds for the Indian River Medical Center in Vero Beach, Florida, and was special adviser to the board at his death. He was a board member to the Riverside Theatre in Vero Beach, the Humane Society of Vero Beach and Vero Beach Museum of Art. Besides serving as a director of International Paper, the world's largest paper company, his corporate board memberships during his career included Chase Industries, Inc., Devlieg-Bullard Inc., First Fidelity Bancorporation, Holnam Inc., Idea Integration Corp., Magma Copper Company, MPS Group Inc., Pioneer Companies, Inc., American Mutual Insurance and Spartech Corporation. John R. \"Jack\" Kennedy was born in Queens, New York, on September 21, 1930. His parents, John R. Kennedy Sr. and Ethel Rose Leavy Kennedy, were both children of Irish Immigrants. Kennedy's marriage to his first wife, Joyce Willis, ended in divorce. In 1974, he married Elizabeth Spyros. Besides his wife, he is survived by three sons from his first marriage, John R.
