It was widely reported last week that Mr. Hudson had been treated with an experimental French drug called HPA-23. Today he denied through a spokesman that he had received the drug. In fact, only a handful of drugs are known to be effective against any virus. Almost all of these drugs were discovered by chance, and the process of developing new drugs is long and tedious. The HPA-23 drug does shows some signs of thwarting the replication of the AIDS virus in the blood - at least while it is being taken. Scientists have also identified several other compounds that seem to stop the AIDS virus in test tube experiments.", "headline": {"main": "SEARCH FOR AN AIDS DRUG IS CASE HISTORY IN FRUSTRATION", "kicker": "THE DOCTOR'S WORLD"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1884, "_id": "4fd14f008eb7c8105d62f2d6", "snippet": "Rock Hudson's pilgrimmage to Paris for treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome underscores the difficulties and frustrations confronting patients and doctors in their efforts to combat the disease.
