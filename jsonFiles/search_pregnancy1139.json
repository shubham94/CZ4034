''The Two Marys'' is the latest documentary to use Mr. Brown's unstoppable ''Da Vinci Code'' as an occasion to look at the state of the folk stories derived from what used to be called high-church Christianity. The program, narrated by Sigourney Weaver, gets off to an awkward start when it refers to the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene as ''media stars'' and ''two of the most popular women on the planet.''
