They said this could be the key to understanding how dioxin, including that contained in Agent Orange, a defoliant used by American forces in Vietnam, might cause a wide variety of health problems, including soft-tissue cancers and birth defects. Representative Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota said in releasing the study at a news conference here that the Dow Chemical Company, one of the manufacturers of Agent Orange, had known about the study at least since 1980 but never made it public. Mr. Daschle, a Democrat, is seeking legislation to compensate Vietnam veterans who contend that their exposure to Agent Orange had caused them to suffer various disorders and caused birth defects in their children. In Michigan, Dow responded by calling Mr. Daschle's announcement ''a textbook case of news manipulation'' that was riddled with errors. A Dow spokesman said the company had provided a copy of the British study, which Dow had no part in originating, to the environmental agency in public hearings in 1980 about the use of 2,4,5-T, a herbicide contained in Agent Orange that was once widely used in the United States to control weeds.", "snippet": "A confidential study by a British scientist indicates that the toxic chemical dioxin causes a long-term breakdown in the human body's immune system, a Congressman who released the study and an Environmental Protection Agency scientist said today.  ..."}], "meta": {"offset": 0, "hits": 2, "time": 43}}}
