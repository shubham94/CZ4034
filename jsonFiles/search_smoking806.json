Research into the vitamin and mineral requirements of Americans over 50 lagged seriously even as age distribution in the nation shifted toward the decades beyond midlife. In devising recommendations about how much of each nutrient should be consumed each day, nutrition experts assumed that people of 70 or 80 were no different from those of 50. But now researchers seeking to correct this oversight are finding that millions of older Americans are nutritionally deprived either because they consume too little of various vitamins and minerals or because certain medical conditions or treatments prevent them from making full use of the nutrients in the foods they eat.", "snippet": "UNTIL recently, little was known about the effects of age on nutrition.
