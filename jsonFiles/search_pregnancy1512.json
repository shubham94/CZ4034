It is a new argument from the conservative right, but it echoes charges that the radical left used to make, to the effect that family planning programs targeted at the third world were a kind of neo-imperialistic genocide. A statistical look around the world shows that if cultural sensitivities are reflected in laws about abortion, there is a remarkable divide between richer countries and poorer ones where abortion and its effects are concerned. But other statistics demonstrate that the pattern of legality does not reflect how women in those societies choose to act. Unequal Death Rates In the global south, where abortion laws are the most restrictive, abortion rates are still quite high; deaths from abortion are much higher there than elsewhere, because the abortions tend to be unsafe. The industrial countries of the global north are almost universally less restrictive in their abortion laws.
