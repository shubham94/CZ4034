Claritin, an antihistamine that does not cause drowsiness while it battles your runny nose or itchy eyes, no longer requires a prescription. It can be bought over the counter at any retail pharmacy. That switch in status, coupled with the expiration of the drug's main patent protection, has led to a precipitous drop in the drug's retail price -- to roughly $1 for a daily tablet from $3. From a consumer's standpoint, this has been a mixed blessing. All allergy sufferers can benefit by gaining ready access to the drug without the hassle and expense of visiting a doctor to get a prescription. But while many patients with limited or no prescription drug coverage are now paying less for the drug, others complain that they have higher out-of-pocket costs because their insurance no longer covers the purchase. That is an unfortunate side effect of the change. Nevertheless, this kind of switch looks like a promising way to restrain escalating drug costs.", "headline": {"main": "Nothing to Sneeze At"}, "abstract": "Editorial on change in status of Claritin from prescription medication to over-the-counter drug says such switches of drugs deemed safe enough to be taken without medical supervision benefit health system over all by reducing unduly high prices and unnecessary doctor visits", "print_page": "34", "word_count": 478, "_id": "4fd23ebd8eb7c8105d7d581b", "snippet": "As allergy sufferers sniffle their way through another pollen-laden spring, they will find an important change in the available medications.
