A century ago, prophets had no trouble knowing what life today would be like. The Popular Science Monthly already realized in 1895 that the 20th century would be ''the Trolley Age.'' In ''Looking Backward,'' the best seller that fomented a national political movement in the 1890's, Edward Bellamy foresaw that the Socialist government of the year 2000 would give each citizen an annual ''credit card'' -- and that the allotted sum would be so generous that the happy citizen wouldn't even want to spend it all. The house of 2000, according to H.G. Wells, would have self-cleaning windows, and the floor would be easy to sweep because the architect would ''have the sense and ability to round off the angle between wall and floor.'' Wells's most audacious prophecy was about prophecy itself -- what he called ''the discovery of the future.'' Soon, he announced in 1902, experts will make forecasts that ''will be just as certain, just as strictly science, and perhaps just as detailed as the picture that has been built up within the last 100 years to make the geological past.'' Today his smug confidence sounds preposterous, but in fact Wells was quite prescient. The future has been discovered. Most people still don't realize it, but we can scientifically predict what will happen in the next 100 years.", "headline": {"main": "The Optimists Are Right", "kicker": "This Way to the Future"}, "abstract": "John Tierney article on pessimism about future in face of improvements in human condition; discusses tendency to view past with misplaced nostalgia; photos; drawings (L)", "print_page": "91", "word_count": 3313, "_id": "4fd1ed358eb7c8105d73f059", "snippet": "The future used to be so much simpler.
