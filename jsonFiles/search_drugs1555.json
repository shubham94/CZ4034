New research is leading to the conclusion that these instances of absorption are, in effect, altered states in which the mind functions at its peak, time is often distorted and a sense of happiness seems to pervade the moment. Such states, the new research suggests, are accompanied by mental efficiency experienced as a feeling of effortlessness. One team of researchers describes these moments of absorption as ''flow states.'' According to Mike Csikszentmihalyi, a psychologist at the University of Chicago, ''flow'' refers to ''those times when things seem to go just right, when you feel alive and fully attentive to what you are doing.''", "headline": {"main": "CONCENTRATION IS LIKENED TO EUPHORIC STATES OF MIND"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1523, "_id": "4fd159e28eb7c8105d63f172", "snippet": "THE seemingly simple act of being fully absorbed in a challenging task is now being seen as akin to some of the extravagantly euphoric states such as those sought in drugs or sex or through the ''runner's high.''

The effect is odd and somewhat incongruous with the way he looks and with what he does for a living. Max Essex is a mild-mannered, seemingly placid man of 46 whose thatch of thick hair, covering his forehead and ears, makes him look rather boyish. A microbiologist and chairman of the department of cancer biology at the Harvard School of Public Health, he is one of four researchers at Harvard who, in an unusual collaboration, are among those in the forefront of the worldwide effort to find a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. As his part of the group's effort, Essex, with the help of 15 research associates, works with blood samples taken from patients with AIDS, deciphering the exact structure of two types of protein molecules - those that make up the outer envelope of the virus that causes AIDS and those, known as antibodies, that combat the virus by attaching themselves to it and, so to speak, defusing it.", "headline": {"main": "TEAMING UP AGAINST AIDS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "42", "word_count": 6335, "_id": "4fd14a668eb7c8105d627cb9", "snippet": "SOMETIMES, WHEN HE IS SPEAKING about AIDS, Myron Essex sounds like a man possessed.
