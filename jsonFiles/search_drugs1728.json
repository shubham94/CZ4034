For some, the holidays mean a worsening of year-round indigestion that often prompts them to chew an acid-neutralizing tablet, swallow a chalky liquid or drink a fizzing antacid solution. For others, acid indigestion, ''sour'' stomach and heartburn are only occasional problems, brought on by the dietary excesses and irregularities of the holiday season. Americans spend more than $500 million each year on antacid products. A confusing array of these heavily advertised over-the-counter drugs greets consumers, who may select ones that do more harm than good. Others may unwittingly abuse them, thereby masking serious illness that requires medical attention. A glance at the labels should alert you to possible risks of antacid use. Some products say ''not constipating'' while others warn ''may cause diarrhea'' or ''may be constipating.'' Some bear warnings of possible interactions with other medications or of potential dangers to people with kidney disease. Some claim to be low in sodium; others hint at their high sodium content by warning against use by people on salt-restricted diets.", "headline": {"main": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "14", "word_count": 1309, "_id": "4fd131448eb7c8105d5fee7a", "snippet": "THIS is the time of year to eat too much, drink too much, work too hard and stay out too late, with ''acid indigestion'' the all-too-frequent result.

She was 28 years old. Her death in 1974 - as subsequently told in books, articles, plays and now a major motion picture - is a tale of nuclear martyrdom in which her employer is key suspect. Miss Silkwood allegedly had documents, never found, that would have embarrassed her employer, the Kerr- McGee Corporation, a rich, powerful energy-based conglomerate that ran a factory, since closed, near Crescent, Okla., for fabricating nuclear fuel out of plutonium, one of the world's most deadly poisons. In ''Silkwood,'' opening Wednesday at Loews Tower East, the National and local theaters, Meryl Streep plays a redneck turned union activist who swears a lot, sleeps around, and pops pills in the course of her quest to expose Kerr-McGee. The dramatic effectiveness of ''Silkwood'' as a film will have to be left to the critics to judge; as a depiction of a scientific subject, however, it can be faulted. The film poses one question after another: Did Kerr-McGee cover up flaws in plutonium fuel rods? Could such flaws cause a Federally-financed breeder reactor in Washington State to blow up and kill millions of people? Did Miss Silkwood uncover falsified records? Most important, was she forced off the highway that fateful night?", "headline": {"main": "FACT AND LEGEND CLASH IN 'SILKWOOD'"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "23", "word_count": 1224, "_id": "4fd132c08eb7c8105d600f84", "snippet": "One night while driving to a rendezvous with a reporter, Karen Silkwood veered off a lonely stretch of Oklahoma highway and hit a concrete culvert at a speed of about 45 miles per hour.
