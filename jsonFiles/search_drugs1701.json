The drug has also attracted a considerable cult following, enormous journalistic attention and highly profitable sales for unapproved uses. The Food and Drug Administration has approved DMSO for only one medical use: to relieve the pain of a rare bladder disorder called interstitial cystitis. However, since DMSO is legally sold over the counter as an industrial chemical (as well as by veterinarian's prescription for a few animal problems), the Federal Government cannot stop people from buying and applying it for myriad conditions ranging in seriousness from sprained ankles to cancer. It is most popular among professional athletes, who use it as a chemical hot-water bottle and contend that it gets them back into play within days of an injury; without it, they say, they have to sit on the sidelines for weeks while nature takes its time in healing. Patients suffering the crippling pain of arthritis have also given it considerable grass-roots support, although the Arthritis Foundation has repeatedly said that evidence of DMSO's effectiveness is lacking and has warned against unsupervised use of nonmedical preparations of DMSO.", "headline": {"main": "DEBATE RAGES ON DMSO DESPITE ITS USERS' CLAIMS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1669, "_id": "4fd136358eb7c8105d607754", "snippet": "AS with many other unproved substances with seemingly miraculous properties, DMSO has been dubbed alternately a panacea and a snake oil.
