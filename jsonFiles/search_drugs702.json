Women taking the pills had a greater risk of breast cancer, heart attacks, strokes and blood clots than other women, and the damage was not offset by a small beneficial effect in reducing the risk of colon cancer and hip fractures. Even so, many women have been reluctant to abandon the hormone therapy because it makes them feel better, more energetic, mentally sharper and more sexually responsive. Or so they have thought. Now comes the bad news that they have most likely been mistaken. New study results just released by The New England Journal of Medicine show that the pills had no significant effect on the quality of life of a large group of postmenopausal women. Women who took the pills did not feel any healthier or more vital than comparable women who took placebos, nor did they have more sexual pleasure.

Not surprisingly, there are rules. In 1987, Dr. John Bower, a kidney specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, was sued after dismissing from his practice a patient who regularly missed dialysis appointments, verbally abused nurses and even threatened to kill Bower and a hospital administrator. Bower cited medical noncompliance and violent threats as grounds for terminating care. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, agreed with him, ruling that doctors can refuse to treat violent or intransigent patients as long as they give proper notice so that the patient can find alternative care. Forcing doctors to treat such patients, the court said, would violate the 13th Amendment, which prohibits involuntary servitude. Sometimes doctors can refuse to treat on the basis of conscience. I once took care of a man in his 50's who had metastatic tongue cancer and respiratory failure requiring a ventilator. His family refused to turn off the machine and let him die, choosing instead to escalate treatment with even more aggressive interventions. Medicine is a stochastic science -- no doctor can predict the future -- but in this case the outcome was never in doubt. Advanced cancer patients who end up on ventilators die during their hospitalizations. Life support was futile, and continuing to insert catheters and tubes into this man seemed inhumane. After the attending physician and I consulted with the hospital's ethics committee, we told the family that we could no longer obey their wishes. We gave them the option of transferring the patient to another hospital.

This has proved a brilliant strategy for several conditions. Detecting high blood pressure, for example, and treating it can cut a patient's risk of stroke by a third and the chances of heart disease by 20 percent. Identifying patients with the first signs of diabetes and controlling their blood sugar can help significantly reduce the chances of cardiovascular disease, kidney and neurological damage and blindness. By spotting an abdominal aneurysm, doctors can monitor the progress of the defect and repair it before it ruptures. The notion that disease could be prevented at all was shaped by the sanitary movement of the 19th century, when doctors and antipoverty activists set about improving the living conditions of the poor and reduced the appalling rates of infectious disease. Today, the simplest and most effective prevention medicine stops disease before it starts through vaccinations, for instance, or encouraging people to exercise more, smoke less, eat fruits and vegetables and drink in moderation -- all of which can cut the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke. But while this sort of prevention clearly works, a troubling trend has taken root when it comes to doctors actively treating patients with drugs or procedures to prevent disease. Dr. Eric Schneider, an assistant professor of medicine at the Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, refers to it as ''prevention creep.'' It is the general faith in the power of medical intervention to thwart not only certain discrete diseases, like hypertension, but also most chronic or potentially life-threatening conditions. The corollary to this idea is that intervening works best when the disease is detected as early as possible, preferably before symptoms appear. Doctors and their patients, Schneider says, have come to believe implicitly in the notion that catching any disease early and treating it -- often aggressively -- can make you live longer.", "headline": {"main": "The Perils of Prevention"}, "abstract": "Shannon Brownlee article on perils of 'prevention creep': aggressive use of drugs and procedures to prevent widening array of chronic or potentially life-threatening illnesses; says faith in interventionist preventive medicine is partly due to proliferation of diagnostic tests that allow doctors to detect signs of disease in people who have few or no symptoms, such as PSA test for prostate cancer, mammography for breast cancer, full-body CT scan for kidney cancer and DEXA scans for osteoporosis; says most troubling possibility involves procedures like carotid endarterectomy for people with only moderately blocked carotid arteries, where potential risks far outweigh any possible benefit in preventing stroke; photo (L)", "print_page": "52", "word_count": 3160, "_id": "4fd227058eb7c8105d7af6c9", "snippet": "One of the central tenets of modern medicine is that the earlier your doctor can catch a disease, the better.
