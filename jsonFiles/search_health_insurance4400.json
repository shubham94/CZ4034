Cochran of the law firm of Wilson, Smith, Cochran & Dickerson in Seattle described why she thought there were no \"evil forces at work\" when often refuse to pay for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone-marrow transplants in breast-cancer cases. \"Skeptics argue that treatment for desperately ill women should not await the rigors of scientific scrutiny, as these women do not have the time to wait for science to prove the treatment. Much the same would have been said by women who received radical mastectomies at the hands of enthusiastic surgeons convinced that this was the 'only cure' for their breast cancer. Unfortunately science later proved this to be untrue in many cases.\" Ms. Cochran said it was paradoxical that customers should criticize insurers for failing to reimburse a treatment that, some companies say, has not proved to be superior. Another lawyer, L. Susan Slavin of Slavin & Steinberg, said that in most cases insurers cited contractual agreements that really did not limit the procedure, because it is merely an extension of high-dose chemotherapy, which is usually covered. \"It's just a matter of dollars and cents,\" Ms. Slavin said. \"It's an expensive procedure, and every time they say no to it they save $150,000.\" On Long Island, where the incidence of breast cancer is higher than the statewide average, the battle is frequently played out. Those women with advanced breast cancer who have been told by their physicians that they have no treatment options other than transplants and whose insurers have refused to pay for the procedure are being encouraged by advocacy groups to take further action. Insurance companies are fighting back. Liz LoRusso, executive director of one local advocacy group, 1 in 9, said the cases of 11 women seeking reimbursements had gone to litigation and been settled in favor of the patients. Many other battles have been fought over the telephone and through the mail, she added. \"Two to three years ago there were no attorneys trained to help us fight,\" Ms. LoRusso said. \"Now there are. Women with breast cancer are viewed as very weak. Well, we're the strongest people you'll ever find, because we're fighting for our lives. We'll leave no stone unturned.\" Arlene Pokorny, 47, of Melville, was given a diagnosis of breast cancer in 1979 and is now fighting her third recurrence. At her physician's urging, she requested clearance from her insurance carrier to pay for transplants. \"I've never been denied anything,\" Ms. Pokorny said. \"Now my life is hanging on a thread. I'm living in terror all the time that they'll say no.\" She added that she had hired a lawyer \"just in case I'll need one.\" After weeks of legal proceedings her insurance company agreed to cover her transplant. Role of Bar Associations The chief of psychiatry service at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, Dr. Jimmie Holland, said: \"I think this adds to the already high sense of vulnerability and uncertainty that women already feel about the disease. It's kind of a betrayal. Anxiety and depression are already felt by women with breast cancer. The need for this kind of fight just compounds it.\" Ms. Slavin said she worried about \"how many women out there who, when they know their insurance company won't pay for their treatment, just walk away from the fight.\" To assist women who have been denied reimbursements for transplants or other procedures or who face other obstacles from their carriers the Nassau and Suffolk Bar Associations will soon distribute brochures to breast-cancer coalitions, doctors' offices, hospitals and clinics announcing their free law program, said Tom Maligno, executive director of the associations. \"It's a chance to reach the clients who need us most and a unique opportunity for the health and legal professions to work together,\" he said. What remains to be seen, however, is whether legal help will settle differences between carriers and clients. Many insurers say they are prepared to change their contracts and claims reviews to avoid being responsible for procedures like transplants. Kathy Olson, a spokeswoman for Mutual of Omaha, which insures more than 10 million individual and group policyholders, said there was no way that Mutual could have anticipated the surge in technology. As a result, she said, Mutual will try to clarify its new policies to avoid disputes. Insurers usually wait for a procedure to be accepted by medical experts before they extend coverage to it. \"In the future,\" Ms. Olson said, \"we'll use the percent-success rate of a treatment to measure the success of it, so that there's a clearer understanding of what is experimental.\" The associate general counsel of the Blue Cross-Blue Shield Association of Chicago, Mary Ader, said: \"We're working for the benefit of the subscribers. Our desire is to cure our patients. We don't want them languishing in hospitals. We want them to live, and live a healthy life.\" 'Sympathy and Concern' The associate director of the cancer-therapy-evaluation program at the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Michael A. Friedman, said that he had \"enormous sympathy and concern\" for people who wanted to optimize their chances of living, but that he was not sure that the relentless pressure that patients and their doctors and lawyers put on insurers was in the patients' best interest. \"Look, this is not a story that lends itself to simple truths,\" he said. \"In certain selected situations bone-marrow transplants can be very efficacious. But there are many unanswered questions.\" Dr. Friedman cautions patients about being too optimistic about the possibilities of transplants and suggests that they wait for the results of four trials that are under way. The tests are intended to compare the benefits and risks of the procedure to conventional chemotherapy for treating localized breast cancer at high risk of recurrence and metastatic breast cancer. \"Patients should opt for a treatment that's indisputable, one that's ethically and scientifically correct,\" he said. From the point of view of many physicians, the criticism of using transplants outside clinical trials for their patients is unfounded. The physician in charge of the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Program at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, Dr. Michael Schuster, said: \"The problem is that treatments for all cancers might be viewed as experimental, in the sense that they're constantly evolving, constantly moving forward. The only way we can move forward is to introduce new treatments in the hope that we can cure a larger percentage of patients. \"If third-party payers slam the door on new treatments by using the 'E' word, then no progress will be made. We'd be using the same kind of medicine that we did five years ago.\" Health-care economists say physicians are part of the problem in the equation that divides the insured from insurance companies. Prof. Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said: \"On the one hand, physicians tell you they were trained in school to fight for their patients and do their best. But they were not trained as guardians of the U.S. Treasury. If there's any hope that something will work, then they are morally obliged to do it. \"On the other hand, you can't run a health system on that algorithm. You have to allow nonphysicians further upstream to actually make the hard calls and not give away the Gross National Product.\" Professor Reinhardt suggested that a dispassionate panel of experts intervene when a doctor proposes to treat a patient with a controversial therapy. Many insurance companies have begun to do that, and more say they will follow that route. Use of Independent Panel The director of technology assessment and policy for Aetna Health Plans in Hartford, William McGivney, said that in the 20-month period that Aetna has used an independent panel to help it decide financing in more than 100 decisions, one case against it has gone to court. \"We've extended ourselves to meet the needs of our patients,\" Mr. McGivney said. \"If we've got three experts who are saying no to a treatment then we're pretty sure it's not appropriate care for a patient.\" Aetna, Prudential and Travelers subscribe to the Medical Care Ombudsman Program in Washington. The director of the program, Grace Powers Monaco, said it promised to provide fast authoritative reviews of treatments. The program will work with a patient and insurer to resolve any issues \"in a sensitive and personal matter,\" she said. \"I think grown-ups have to be grow up about their medical care,\" Ms. Monaco, a lawyer, said. \"They don't want to waste their money and resources on a procedure that can't really provide them with an increased amount of life. I think, unfortunately, we've made a big mistake in this country that we've not educated our children, young people and adults about how to evaluate their medical care options. If you see something like H.D.C./A.B.M.T. depicted in the media as a treatment for one thing you might not understand that it only works in a patient that looks, tastes and smells a certain way. It may not be for you.\" Votes of Confidence Some lawyers say they feel confident about the future. Louis J. Castellano Jr., who successfully represented Joseph Scalamandre in a suit in Federal District Court in Uniondale, said the value in overturning a denial of coverage by Oxford Health Plans Inc. for a transplant for Mr. Scalamandre's wife was that \"carriers now notice there was a case tried to conclusion, and the determination was made against the carrier.\" That was just one more case that seems to add to \"the majority rule in the United States that this treatment is not experimental in most jurisdictions,\" Mr. Castellano said. Ms. Ader of Blue Cross-Blue Shield disagreed, saying: \"The effect of judicial opinion, as defined by law, is that there's precedent only in jurisdictional issues. Such opinions have no value outside of that jurisdiction. The courts are not required to follow it elsewhere. It is not binding.\" In one of the largest challenges to the denial of \"investigational chemotherapy,\" Memorial Sloan-Kettering, in a complaint filed in State Supreme Court, maintains that Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield should be ordered to pay $12 million in compensatory and punitive damages for refusing to cover transplants for cancer patients. Who will ultimately have the power to make health decisions is certainly going to be a \"major issue for the women here,' said Patricia Spicer of Cancer Care in Woodbury, a clinical coordinator for breast-cancer services on Long Island. \"This issue has already been coming up more often in our groups, because more doctors are recommending H.D.C./A.B.M.T. early on.\"", "headline": {"main": "Lawyers Debate the Insurability of Bone-Marrow Transplants"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "word_count": 1771, "_id": "4fd1d7648eb7c8105d71543a", "snippet": "SPEAKING at a meeting of the American Bar Association in New York City, Kathy A.
