In the last few weeks, law-enforcement authorities working in at least 15 states have seized more than 6,000 pounds of cocaine, nearly a month's supply for the United States. And, Bolivian authorities working with the United States Army say they have ended cocaine production in that country, at least temporarily, through raids over the last six weeks. It is estimated that these raids have cut off 20 percent to 40 percent of the United States' cocaine supply. But even with all this cocaine being kept off the American market, enforcement officials say that the price of the drug has not risen and that cocaine remains widely available on the streets.", "headline": {"main": "EXPERTS SEE U.S. COCAINE PROBLEM AS CONTINUING DESPITE ANTIDRUG RAIDS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": 1633, "_id": "4fd165678eb7c8105d652ad1", "snippet": "In New Mexico last month, the authorities seized 1,184 pounds of cocaine hidden in a pickup truck.

Police in New York the other day raided more than 200 stores and confiscated - under an obscure public health law - about 39,000 pipes of the kind often used for smoking crack.
