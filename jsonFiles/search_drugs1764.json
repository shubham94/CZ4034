The physician, Dr. Donald R. Cole, who described himself as a ''pioneer'' in treating cancer with laetrile and experimental drugs and therapies, operated what he described as a holistic center for treating the disease in Floral Park, L.I. But in announcing on Friday that his license to practice medicine in New York State was being revoked, the board said that rather than effect cures, Dr. Cole, once a clinical associate surgeon at the National Cancer Center, had ''lured patients with fraud.'' Court Fight Promised A receptionist at Dr. Cole's Floral Park office said she did not know where he was and referred calls to Steven Kern, a lawyer in Elizabeth, N. J. In a telephone interview from Tampa, Fla., Mr. Kern said that the 55-year-old Dr. Cole denied all the allegations against him and would fight the revocation of his license in the courts. According to Chris Stern Hyman, chief counsel for the State Office of Professional Medical Conduct, Dr. Cole was the 19th physician to lose a license this year, compared with 14 in the two preceeding years.", "headline": {"main": "CANCER ISSUE COSTS DOCTOR STATE LICENSE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "word_count": 605, "_id": "4fd1271f8eb7c8105d5ee325", "snippet": "The State Board of Regents has revoked the medical license of a Scarsdale surgeon on the ground that his promises of curing cancer so deviated from accepted medical practice that they were ''tantamount to quackery.''
