A1 Grim Acceptance in Philippines A turning point has been reached in the Philippines as officials and villagers begin to wrestle with early warning signs that were ignored, and with accepting the scope of the mudslide disaster that may have killed more than 1,800 people. A1 Tension Over Holocaust Files Tempers are flaring over a United States demand to open to scholars and researchers a huge repository of information about the Holocaust contained in the files of the International Tracing Service at Bad Arolsen, Germany. A3 Cracks in Canada's Health Care In Canada's public health care system, several large provinces are opening the way for private health care. The Quebec government proposed to lift a ban on private insurance for some elective surgeries. A4 Attacks in Iraq Kill 17 At least 17 people were killed in insurgent attacks, and talks on a unity government among Iraq's political factions remained deadlocked less than a week before the new Parliament's first meeting.

A7 Kenyan Fights Corruption With Kenyan cabinet ministers resigning and the police seizing the passports of officials linked to corruption, John Githongo, the onetime government insider behind it all, says an important corner may have been turned in the fight against corruption.

A9 Broader Deportation at Issue As the Bush administration rapidly expands its efforts to detain and deport illegal immigrants, human rights groups are warning that people fleeing persecution are becoming increasingly vulnerable to being deported to their home countries. In 2005, a bipartisan federal commission warned that some immigration officials were improperly processing asylum seekers for deportation. A9 Levee Upkeep Called Chaotic The Army Corps of Engineers is overlooking one of the most important causes of Hurricane Katrina's flooding of New Orleans: its own organizational failures, according to a new report from an outside engineering group working with the corps. The corps is spending about $20 million to understand the physical causes of the levee breaches that left more than 75 percent of New Orleans flooded. But the engineering group said the corps should also be looking into ''discontinuity and chaos'' in the creation and maintenance of the levees.
