A bill approved by the Legislature this month seeks to make insurance affordable and readily available to all those who don't have it while taking steps to control health care costs and improve its quality. The plan is notable for its boldness in a period of great budgetary gloom in most state capitals. The core of Maine's plan is an interesting effort to transform the vast amount of money that hospitals and other health care providers currently lose on bad debts and charity care into a revenue stream to subsidize health coverage for the uninsured. As things stand now, health providers in Maine deliver some $275 million a year in free care and cover that cost by raising their rates for everyone else, thereby driving up insurance costs. Maine believes it can recapture perhaps $80 million of that lost money by insuring a lot of those who now get free care, pressing hospitals to reduce their rates accordingly and charging insurance companies a fee to reflect any savings they realize from lower hospital rates.", "headline": {"main": "On Health Care, Maine Leads"}, "abstract": "Editorial hails Maine's program to provide health insurance to all uninsured residents (National Edition)", "print_page": "26", "word_count": 473, "_id": "4fd2432d8eb7c8105d7dc8a4", "snippet": "At a time when many states are scrambling to reduce their medical expenditures because of looming budget deficits, Maine has taken the opposite course with a program to provide health insurance for all of the state's uninsured residents.
