Today, at 44, he's a new, unrecognizable man. Almost 100 pounds lighter, he boasts 12 percent body fat, a superhero jaw line and skin tone that seems almost incandescent. Savage says he owes much of his transformation to the self-administration of human growth hormone (H.G.H.). ''I worked with a personal trainer and a nutritionist first,'' he says. ''I actually gained three pounds. Then I started growth hormone, and the weight dropped away.'' Like a freshly hatched evangelist, Savage quit emergency-room medicine and in 2004 co-established a clinic in Chicago dedicated to hormone therapy, with an emphasis on H.G.H. His franchise, which operates under the name BodyLogicMD, serves about 1,500 people nationwide, many of whom pay upward of $15,000 for a yearly cycle of growth-hormone injections.
