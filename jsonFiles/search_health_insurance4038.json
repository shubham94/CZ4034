Many say the average charge for health benefits, deducted from paychecks, will go up at least 5 percent, or more than twice as much as wages and inflation. 1 Interest Groups Join Debate A diverse array of civic, religious, business and labor groups -- including the American Heart Association, the Gray Panthers and the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association -- are actively taking part in the often-arcane campaign finance debate over unregulated soft money, issue advertisements and political action committees. Their effect on the issue suggests that the procedural votes the Senate held this month are unlikely to be the last word. 1 Battle on Bankruptcy Revisions Even before sending it to Congress, the authors of a proposed revision to the Federal bankruptcy law have begun squabbling over its conclusions.

Eristoff ignored the city's voluntary campaign spending limits and spent $900,000 -- most of it his own money -- to win his City Council seat. This year, the Manhattan Republican has raised $315,000 to fend off a Democrat's challenge in what is sure to be the city's most expensive Council race. 41 OBITUARIES 44-45 Nancy Dickerson A journalist and television producer, who in the 1950's and 60's combined network television reporting with her role as a sought-after Washington party giver and insider, was 70.
