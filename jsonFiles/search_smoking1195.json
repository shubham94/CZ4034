The risk to nonsmoking wives was directly related to the amount their husbands smoked, and that risk was one-half to one-third that of direct smoking. Results of the statistical study, which are being published in tomorrow's issue of The British Medical Journal, ''appear to explain the long-standing riddle of why many women develop lung cancer although they themselves are nonsmokers,'' Dr. Takeshi Hirayama, the author of the study, said in an interview. Dr. Hirayama is chief epidemiologist of the National Cancer Center Research Institute in Tokyo. Effects Previously Suspected The study also strengthens the thesis that the effect of tobacco smoke on the nonsmoker, which has been variously called passive, second-hand or involuntary smoking, may be a cause of lung cancer in the general population.", "snippet": "Wives who did not smoke but were exposed to their husbands' cigarette smoke developed lung cancer at a much higher rate than nonsmoking wives of nonsmoking husbands, according to results of a major 14-year study in Japan.
