''Too bad I'm not selling cars,'' he jokes with one pear-shaped man after setting him up with a pair of khakis -- 40-inch waist, cuffs, pleats -- in less than 15 seconds. There's something self-conscious about Jeff's act, as if he's trying to prove to himself that he's comfortable with his job. Or maybe it's that he's overcompensating for having been a bit slow to tell me about it a few weeks earlier. (''I'm working in retail now,'' he had said cryptically.) Either explanation makes sense.
