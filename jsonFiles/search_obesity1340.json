He looked out at us from millions of television screens across the nation, a latter-day Lazarus, a man whose life had been forfeit. A few weeks ago, calmly sitting there in Salt Lake City in his blue pajamas and red dressing gown, Dr. Barney B. Clark talked easily if somewhat breathlessly for the video cameras. It seemed impossible that just three months earlier he had been rushed into an operating room in the evening, so near death that the surgery could not wait until the next morning. We have all been caught up in the drama. For the first time, an alien object made of metal and plastic has permanently taken the place of a failing heart. As of this writing, 15 weeks after the operation, the courageous patient has fought his way past one setback after another. The two men most intimately responsible for the achievement -Dr. William C. DeVries, the surgeon, and Dr. Robert K. Jarvik, the designer of the artificial heart -have become national figures.", "snippet": "Harry Schwartz, writer-in-residence at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, is a former member of The New York Times's editorial board.
