The antiviral drug, azidothymidine, holds ''great promise for prolonging life for certain patients with AIDS,'' said Dr. Robert E. Windom, the Assistant Secretary for Health. The announcement today provided the first beam of hope in the battle against acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

The creation of the three-month-old nonprofit private research and education organization, set up to promote production of lean meat raised with a minimum of drugs and chemicals, marks a change in the meat industry's attitude toward consumer demands for a leaner, safer product. Foundation directors will develop standards and a compliance system for the fat content of meats as well as for restrictions on the use of drugs and chemicals. Ten years ago, when Dietary Goals for the United States first recommended a switch from fat to lean meat for health reasons, the beef industry responded by trying to have the guidelines amended.
