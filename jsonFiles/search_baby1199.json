But the cost of it all is rising faster than the rate of inflation, and faster than the Federal deficit. With bipartisan agreement, Washington has imposed stringent cost controls on its biggest health program, Medicare, which provides insurance for doctor and hospital costs for 30 million elderly and disabled people. Medicare now pays hospitals a set amount for each case, depending on the diagnosis, regardless of how long the patient is hospitalized. This system, being put into effect over a three-year period that began in October 1983, has given hospitals new incentives to economize. But some members of Congress and many physicians say it has adversely affected the quality of care, prompting some hospitals to discharge patients prematurely. A recent study found that the system of fixed payment rates for each of 468 diagnostic categories discriminates against certain hospitals because it ''does not adequately reflect the complexity and severity of illness'' and the variations among patients with the same diagnosis. A spokesman for the Health Care Financing Administration, the agency that runs Medicare, agreed some adjustment was needed. Private employers and insurance companies are also cracking down on costs. In the new competitive climate, doctors, hospitals and nursing homes are seeking new, more efficient ways to deliver care. To analyze these trends, The Week in Review called on two experts: Professor Karen Davis, an economist who is chairman of the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, and Dr. Raymond Scalettar, a trustee of the American Medical Association who specializes in internal medicine in Washington, D.C.
