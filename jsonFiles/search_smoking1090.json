Many of these people jogged, played tennis and watched their weight with never an inkling that their coronary arteries had become progressively clogged and that their hearts were in mortal danger. Now, in what appears to have come as a major surprise to the medical profession, conclusive evidence has been published in the last 18 months that for millions of people one of the body's primary warning systems for heart disease can be defective, slow to turn on or missing. The warning system is a network of nerves encompassing the heart that signals angina pectoris, or chest pain. When blood flow to the heart is reduced for any reason, pain is sometimes - but not always - felt.", "snippet": "EVERY year, 450,000 seemingly healthy Americans drop dead in their tracks from massive heart attacks that strike without warning.

Edward, who has pronounced opinions on most subjects, says he has no answers on this one. Lately, however, he's been asking more questions. Jim, a transplanted Texan and regular churchgoer, will tell you tongue in cheek that his idea of heaven, ''based on my childhood beliefs,'' is ''a canasta game with lots of coffee and cigarettes.'' But he's been asking more questions, too. He's concluded, he says, that God will not give him more than he can handle. Jim, 35, has Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Edward, 43, is his ''crisis intervention worker,'' a counselor assigned to him last August by the nonprofit Gay Men's Health Crisis, which, through its 1,100 volunteers, provides nonmedical outpatient assistance to New Yorkers with AIDS. Edward's job is to help Jim and his lover through the many difficulties - financial, legal, medical - they are certain to encounter due to Jim's condition. Jim has not yet had any repeated, protracted hospital stays, but Edward is ready for them. He knows about AIDS. His own lover died as a result of it less than 18 months ago.", "snippet": "ONE NIGHT RECENTLY, JIM Sharp and Edward Dunn spent a few hours together discussing the nature of God, mortality and eternity.
