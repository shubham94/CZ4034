The sun has burned through the clouds and hangs low over the Atlantic Ocean, which stretches like a slate blanket beyond the boardwalk, a lonely, nearly mile-long strip of warped and splintered wood that long ago had the life drained from it. On this day, Sal Marino and Richard Handschuch are among a small clutch of people strolling on the boards, as has become their habit. Since the men, both in their 60's, retired from teaching several years ago, they have turned their love of the seashore and quest for fitness into a second career of sorts as boardwalk chroniclers. They are the authors of ''The Beach Bum's Guide to the Boardwalks of New Jersey'' (Beach Bum Press), which offers tidbits about the state's 41 boardwalks, 28 of which follow the shore in a broken line from Sea Bright in the north to Cape May in the south.", "headline": {"main": "On the Boardwalk"}, "abstract": "Article traces history and describes current condition of Jersey Shore's oceanfront boardwalks which, if strung together end to end, would stretch 32 miles; list; photos (L)", "print_page": "1", "word_count": 3392, "_id": "4fd243838eb7c8105d7dd499", "snippet": "IT is late morning down the Jersey Shore.

Witness Chloe, which has shot from 184 to 24 since 1991. Call out the name in your local Gymboree, and four little heads will whip around. Popular Baby Names, which is operated by the Social Security Administration, ranks the 1,000 most common boys' and girls' names since 1900 (www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/). You can also look up a specific name and track its status over time (an activity that, I warn you, is an Internet addict's sinkhole).
