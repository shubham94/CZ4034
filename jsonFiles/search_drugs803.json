Soon, AIDS in Africa will be doing more than killing millions every year. It will destroy what there is of Africa's economy and cause further instability and, perhaps, war. In the year 2010, the country of South Africa will be almost one-fifth poorer than it would have been had AIDS never existed. Throughout Africa, the disease has ravaged the young, urban and mobile. It has robbed schools of their teachers and hospitals of their doctors and nurses. Businesses are depleted by the need to cope with sick and dying employees. AIDS takes the breadwinner, leaving millions of destitute elderly and orphans who will grow up without going to school, many on the streets. As they lose their productive citizens, the nations themselves face collapse. At the moment, however, AIDS in Africa is only a plague of a severity not seen since the Black Death killed at least a quarter of Europe in the 14th century. A 15-year-old in South Africa has a better than even chance of dying of AIDS. One in five adults is infected with H.I.V. Hospitals are filled with babies so shriveled by AIDS that nurses must shave their heads to find veins for intravenous tubes.
