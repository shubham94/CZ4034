This has proved a brilliant strategy for several conditions. Detecting high blood pressure, for example, and treating it can cut a patient's risk of stroke by a third and the chances of heart disease by 20 percent. Identifying patients with the first signs of diabetes and controlling their blood sugar can help significantly reduce the chances of cardiovascular disease, kidney and neurological damage and blindness. By spotting an abdominal aneurysm, doctors can monitor the progress of the defect and repair it before it ruptures. The notion that disease could be prevented at all was shaped by the sanitary movement of the 19th century, when doctors and antipoverty activists set about improving the living conditions of the poor and reduced the appalling rates of infectious disease. Today, the simplest and most effective prevention medicine stops disease before it starts through vaccinations, for instance, or encouraging people to exercise more, smoke less, eat fruits and vegetables and drink in moderation -- all of which can cut the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke. But while this sort of prevention clearly works, a troubling trend has taken root when it comes to doctors actively treating patients with drugs or procedures to prevent disease. Dr. Eric Schneider, an assistant professor of medicine at the Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, refers to it as ''prevention creep.'' It is the general faith in the power of medical intervention to thwart not only certain discrete diseases, like hypertension, but also most chronic or potentially life-threatening conditions. The corollary to this idea is that intervening works best when the disease is detected as early as possible, preferably before symptoms appear. Doctors and their patients, Schneider says, have come to believe implicitly in the notion that catching any disease early and treating it -- often aggressively -- can make you live longer.", "snippet": "One of the central tenets of modern medicine is that the earlier your doctor can catch a disease, the better.
