She was born in Greensboro, NC, on October 27, 1925. Her family moved to New York City in 1935, where Fran lived most of her joyous life. Her last days were spent surrounded by her devoted family. Loved by countless family and friends for her cheerful, optimistic outlook on life, she treasured and took pride in three areas. First came her loved and loving family. Her 67-year marriage to John bore a daughter, Claudia, and a son Jeff. Claudia is the mother of two outstanding girls, Dana and Lynn. Jeff and his wife Gonda add five more beautiful grandchildren: Aiyana, Taimah, Naomi, Maya, and Kaylee. Fran delighted in them, carrying pictures that she would show to anyone at a moment's notice. All looked forward to seeing Grandma Fran at every opportunity. She loved having them visit so that she could show them the sights of Manhattan. Her second source of pride was her 21 years with the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York. She admired this pioneer organization of group medical practice. Dozens of former co-workers remember her as supervisor, mentor, and colleague. They speak of her smile lighting up any room that she entered. After retirement Fran had a second career as a volunteer in the emergency room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She comforted distraught patients and their worried relatives as only a calm and empathetic person could. After seventeen years she was honored as \"Best Volunteer of the Year.\" She was deeply saddened by the closing of this vital resource in April of last year. She loved music of all kinds, living it rather than just hearing it. She also seemed almost to become part of the flowers, greenery, and trees that made the wonders of nature so important to her. Her buoyant and loving spirit will live on through her husband, children, grandchildren, and all of those who knew and loved her. Friends may call from 1 to 2pm at Andrett Funeral Home, 353 2nd Avenue, Manhattan, on Sunday, September 18, with a celebration of her life to follow at 2pm.<br><br>\n ", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  GEBHARDT, FRANCES S."}, "abstract": null, "print_page": null, "word_count": "361", "_id": "5213e3b579881007d5907a32", "snippet": "GEBHARDT--Frances S., died August 4, 2011 after brief Hospice care for her lung cancer.
