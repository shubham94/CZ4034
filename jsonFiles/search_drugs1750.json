Yet, over the last year, several hundred such experiments in England have demonstrated a tantalizing fact: that pure interferon, made artificially, can, under certain circumstances, protect humans against a single virus of the common cold. ''There is no doubt whatsoever that if you use interferon as a spray before the virus gets to you, you can prevent a cold,'' said Dr. David A.J. Tyrrell, director of the Medical Research Council's Common Cold Unit at Harvard Hospital in Salisbury, England. The experiments involved volunteers representing a broad cross-section of British people. Each received nine doses of interferon by nasal spray, then a common cold virus by droplet, then several more days of nine interferon doses each. ''It is virtually complete protection'' against the cold, said Dr. Tyrrell. ''We just haven't had a cold in the volunteers.'' And he considers the experiments particularly valuable in learning how to use interferon for people already ill with serious chronic diseases for whom a cold could be a health disaster.", "headline": {"main": "INTERFERON MAKES INROADS AGAINST SOME INFECTIONS, INCLUDING COLDS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1588, "_id": "4fd122da8eb7c8105d5e5d3f", "snippet": "THE experiments are simple: no injections or complex equipment, just a nasal spray and an ordinary nose-drop dispenser.
