As survivors dug out other victims and washed the dead for burial, Iranian officials appealed for international assistance. It was the third major quake for Iran this year. When an elementary school collapsed in one village, 110 young girls were killed. A1 Pope Speaks in Lebanon Pope John Paul II addressed several hundred thousand people at a Mass in Lebanon, his first visit to the Middle East as Pope. Commentators said the Mass had drawn what appeared to be the largest gathering in Lebanon's history, certainly the largest since the civil war ended in 1990. A8 Palestinian's Death Questioned A spokesman said the Israeli police were investigating whether a slain Palestinian real estate agent was killed because of a business dispute or because he sold land to Jews. The Palestinian police have also announced an investigation, but Israeli security officials said privately, as did many Palestinians, that they suspected the Palestinian Authority in the death. The authority said last week that it would impose speedy death sentences for the sale of land to Israelis. A3 Irish Election Is Expected Prime Minister John Bruton said a national election would be held in Ireland in early June. His integrity and his policy on Northern Ireland peace talks have been under attack, and his coalition Government has slipped in the polls. Mr. Bruton, who has been Prime Minister of Ireland since December 1994, said the vote would probably be held on June 6. A10 India and Pakistan to Talk The Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan, I. K. Gujral and Nawaz Sharif, arrived in Male in the Maldive Islands for an encounter today that will test their readiness to reduce the tensions that have poisoned relations between the two countries for 50 years. They are attending a summit meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, a grouping of the six countries that make up the Indian subcontinent. A6 Clintons Rest in Barbados President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, got a day off from a Latin American tour on the prim little island of Barbados. The Clintons stayed in Heron Bay, the borrowed 25-acre estate of British aristocrats. A6 Bombs Kill 6 in Algeria Bombs exploded in a discotheque and three booby-trapped cars, killing 6 people and injuring 71 others in Algeria. The attacks came just weeks before the first parliamentary elections in Algeria in five years. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blasts, but suspicion fell on Islamic militants fighting to overthrow the Government; their campaign has killed some 50,000 people since 1992. (AP) NATIONAL A12-13, B8-10 Divisions Dull Optimism Over Tobacco Settlement The initial optimism over the landmark tobacco settlement talks has faded as negotiators head for a potential showdown over the pivotal issue of industry liability for smoking-related claims, people familiar with the talks say. Differences appear to be emerging among the state attorneys general, as well as among state regulators and lawyers for smokers in private lawsuits, over issues like the ability of smokers to bring lawsuits under a settlement plan. A1 Focus on Syphilis Study A Presidential apology will be issued on Friday to the survivors among the group of 400 men in what has come to be known as the Tuskegee experiment. The men were subjected to an experiment designed to study the long-term effects of untreated syphilis on black men. But their wives and children, who may have been exposed to syphilis, have remained largely out of the spotlight. A1 Arizona Governor Faces Trial Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona is scheduled to go on trial in Phoenix on Tuesday on 22 charges of fraud, lying and extortion. The Governor, once a fast-rising star in the Republican Party and a land developer, is accused of misleading and pressuring lenders in a desperate effort to shore up a multimillion-dollar real estate empire that went bankrupt. If convicted, he could be sent to prison for scores of years. B9 Fight Over Census Heats Up Republican leaders in Congress appear to be heading for a showdown with the White House over their opposition to the use of statistical sampling to arrive at final population figures in the next census. Many political analysts say sampling would help Democrats and hurt Republicans because it would tally members of minority groups and poor people who might otherwise go uncounted, which could affect electoral districting. B9 Marines in Crash Are Sought The Navy and Coast Guard teamed up to search by sea and air after a helicopter with four marines aboard crashed into the Pacific Ocean. The helicopter, based in El Toro, Calif., crashed and sank after lifting off at sea from the Juneau, an amphibious transport ship. (AP) Sailor Is Found Dead A man who was pitched overboard from a disabled sailboat during a rescue attempt has been found dead. The sailboat was bumped by a ship attempting to rescue the man and his two comrades. The captain of the sailboat, the Ankh, was hurt during a voyage from Bermuda to the ship's port in Rhode Island. The ship sent out an emergency call about 450 miles east of Cape Henry, Va. (AP) Arizona District to Vote Voters in the 3d Congressional District in northern New Mexico will decide on Tuesday who will succeed Bill Richardson, the Democratic Representative who resigned in February to become ambassador to the United Nations. B8 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 A New Chess Champion Who Can't Take a Bow The I.B.M. computer Deep Blue unseated Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion, as the finest chess-playing entity on the planet. Mr. Kasparov resigned the sixth and final game of the match after just 19 moves. Grandmasters and computer experts alike went from praising the match as a great experiment to smacking their foreheads in amazement at the champion's abrupt crumpling. A1 Stodgy old I.B.M. has now come up with its own media star, even geekier and more glamorous than Microsoft's Bill Gates: Deep Blue, its 1.4-ton chess computer. I.B.M. executives said it was hard to determine how Deep Blue's celebrity would translate into increased sales, though the company's marketers are no doubt conjuring up new advertising campaigns featuring the electronic grand master. B4 Pataki Offers Rent Plan Gov. George E. Pataki proposed immediately lifting rent protections for a small number of wealthy tenants, which appeared to lay the groundwork for a broader plan to remove controls from apartments as they become vacant. The proposals stake out a middle ground between Republicans in the State Senate who want to abolish the current rent regulations and Democrats in the Assembly who want to preserve them. The regulations will expire after June 15 if state lawmakers do not reach an agreement to extend them. A1 John Cardinal O'Connor urged state lawmakers yesterday to preserve the current rent regulation laws until a panel could examine changes that would not hurt the poor and middle classes. In a sermon at St. Patrick's Cathedral, he said ''dignified affordable housing'' was a human right. He did not offer solutions of his own but said a broadly representative commission should be convened to make recommendations to the State Legislature. B6 Harbor Dredging to Begin A floating dredge is scheduled to begin scooping thousands of tons of accumulated mud from one of the main channels plied by the container ships that move into and out of New York Harbor. New York and New Jersey have come up with a few innovative ways to dispose of dredged mud, but they still have not devised a long-term plan to accommodate all the mud, which contains pollutants. B1 2 Men Charged in Ambush Two men were charged with attempted murder and three counts of robbery in the ambush and shooting of a retired police officer and an off-duty detective during a payroll robbery in Queens on Friday. The authorities have identified the men as Aaron Boone, 26, of 53-18 Junction Boulevard in Corona, and Robert Majors, 31, of 134-16 229th Street in Laurelton, Queens. Both men have long criminal records and have served prison sentences, the authorities said. B3 BUSINESS DAY D1-13 Mini-Van's Appeal Fading Mini-van sales are falling after more than a decade of steadily rising sales. No one disputes that the mini-vans are roomy, practical and cheaper than most sport utility vehicles and some of the sedans people are buying instead. But more and more people are rejecting the mommy-mobile image that mini-vans project. A1 Phone Companies' Jitters Large local phone companies around the United States that serve both rural areas and urban areas are bracing for a massive redistribution of revenue caused by telephone deregulation. Some say the changes could jeopardize the nation's tradition of universal phone service.
