Few of these people are deprived, but the growing concentration of income among a select group at the top has left many others with similar talents and experience well behind. [Page A1.] INQUIRY INTO DOW CHEMICAL -- The Securities and Exchange Commission has begun an inquiry into whether two senior executives at Dow Chemical secretly tried to put the company into play, and the unusual trading in its stock that may have resulted, according to people briefed on the matter. [C1.] COKE BUYS MAKER OF VITAMINWATER -- Directors of the Coca-Cola Company approved the purchase of Glaceau, the maker of Vitaminwater, for $4.2 billion in cash and stock, according a person involved in the negotiations. [C1.] CONFRONTING A MANIC MARKET -- One of the biggest challenges for Chinese leaders these days lies in when and how to rein in the country's soaring stock market and, just as important, whom to pick as the next governor of the central bank. [C1.] FACEBOOK WILL HAVE MORE TO DO -- Facebook is escalating its rivalry with MySpace by inviting thousands of technology companies and programmers to contribute features that will allow members to recommend and listen to music, insert Amazon book reviews onto their pages, play games and join charity drives, all without leaving the site. [C1.] ANOTHER DROP IN PROFIT FOR GAP -- Gap Inc., the largest United States clothing retailer, reported its seventh consecutive quarterly decline in profit, and the women's apparel retailer Ann Taylor Stores also reported lower first-quarter profit. Gap said net income dropped 26 percent, to $178 million, and Ann Taylor's profit fell 19 percent, to $31.5 million. Record gasoline prices, in addition to the coldest April in a decade, discouraged shopping during the quarter, said Ann Taylor's chief executive, Kay Krill. [C2.] G.M. EXPECTS $1 BILLION CHARGE -- General Motors said that it expected to take a $1 billion charge in the second quarter and pay a total of $7 billion to cover retirement costs for workers at the Delphi Corporation, its former parts division. The company also said that it had received a new request for accounting documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission. [C2.] OUT-OF-TOWNER ON A SALES TRIP -- Donald J. Trump, along with some hoopla, came to Chicago to promote his gleaming $850 million, 1,392-foot tall hotel and condominium tower along the edge of the Chicago River. The building, under construction, still has some units for sale. ''We want to give people really good deals,'' he said, as gusts of wind buffeted his trademark hair. [A12.] DELL TO SELL IN WAL-MART -- Dell, in a first step toward transforming its ailing strategy of selling direct to consumers, said that it planned to offer computers at Wal-Mart stores, starting in June. [C4.] AN EX-CHIEF'S LEGACY -- Home Depot's ousted chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, loomed large over the company's annual shareholder meeting, as directors and executives struggled with, and at times appeared to clash over, Mr. Nardelli's legacy. [C3.] HOME SALES RISE, AND PRICES FALL -- Sales of new homes surged in April by the biggest jump in 14 years, but the median price of a new home dropped by the largest amount on record -- a sign that builders were cutting prices in an effort to move unsold homes. [C8.] The luxury-home builder Toll Brothers reported a 79 percent decline in second-quarter profit. [C8.] RECORDS SEIZED -- Justice Department investigators have seized records from the headquarters of Air Evac Lifeteam, a large operator of medical helicopters, as part of an investigation, apparently into possible health care fraud.[C10.] LONG-TERM CARE POLICIES -- A Congressional committee asked Conseco and the Penn Treaty American Corporation, two of the nation's largest sellers of long-term care insurance, to produce documents showing how the companies market long-term care policies and handle policyholder claims. [C2.] HEALTH CARE, A JOB MACHINE -- Poor-paying jobs in health care and social work have accounted for most of the job growth in New York City in the last 15 years. And in Brooklyn and the Bronx, health care now supplies about one-third of all private-sector jobs and wages. [A1.] ONLINE SPIKING GAS PRICES -- Gas prices are spiking again and some oil executives are now warning that fuel shortages -- and high prices -- could become a long-term problem.
