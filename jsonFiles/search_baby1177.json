And, Bolivian authorities working with the United States Army say they have ended cocaine production in that country, at least temporarily, through raids over the last six weeks. It is estimated that these raids have cut off 20 percent to 40 percent of the United States' cocaine supply.

Under the bill, an estimated 6 million low-income households would be dropped from the tax rolls entirely. By 1988, households earning less than $10,000 would see their taxes reduced, on average, by 65.7 percent, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.
