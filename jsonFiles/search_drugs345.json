When asked to explain themselves back home, these enchanted wanderers usually stutter something inadequate like ''Oh, the mountains'' or ''The people, they're so hospitable and proud.'' And as their friends and families listen skeptically, they will be busy devising a way to go back. Karen Woo was one of them, a young English doctor who went to Afghanistan in 2009 to visit her boyfriend, who was working there. They broke up; but Karen was smitten by the Afghans. In the week she was there, she visited a charity for street children and toured hospitals. She was appalled by the desperate need and wanted to help.", "headline": {"main": "RENAISSANCE WOMAN", "kicker": "KAREN WOO | B. 1974"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "16", "word_count": 1357, "_id": "4fd2858f8eb7c8105d855fc3", "snippet": "A young English doctor\u2019s Afghan adventure.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/magazine/26Woo-t.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "WOO, KAREN"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Elizabeth", "rank": 1, "lastname": "RUBIN"}], "original": "By ELIZABETH RUBIN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2010-12-26T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National", "lead_paragraph": "Congress approved yet another temporary spending bill, which amounts to a budget cut, given rising costs.", "headline": {"main": "Stopgap Bill Hamstrings Government Programs", "print_headline": "Stopgap Spending Hamstrings Government Programs"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "19", "word_count": "1050", "_id": "542190407988104c4a502aa2", "snippet": "Congress approved yet another temporary spending bill, which amounts to a budget cut, given rising costs.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/us/politics/22spend.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "Politics", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "N", "value": "Federal Budget (US)", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "2", "is_major": "N", "value": "Law and Legislation", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "3", "is_major": "N", "value": "Senate", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "4", "is_major": "N", "value": "House of Representatives", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "5", "is_major": "N", "value": "United States Politics and Government", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "6", "is_major": "N", "value": "Republican Party", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "7", "is_major": "N", "value": "Democratic Party", "name": "organizations"}], "byline": {"contributor": "", "person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "David", "rank": 1}], "original": "By DAVID M.
