It was 1997, and she was a 31-year-old abortion doctor based in Amsterdam, and to her, the idea seemed straightforward and reasonable, as so many ideas do before they take on the weight of reality. She wanted to buy a ship and sail it around the world, providing abortions at sea for women who could not otherwise get them. Gomperts, whose activist roots stem from a stint as the resident doctor on Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior II boat, planned to visit countries where the procedure is either illegal or highly restricted and transport women seeking abortions into international waters, 12 miles offshore. There, a Dutch-registered ship would be subject to Dutch law, and she could legally perform abortions -- something she intended to do free. ''In my trips with Greenpeace, I became aware of the enormous and invisible suffering of women due to illegal abortions,'' Gomperts says. ''To me, this is a basic human rights issue.'' The first time Gomperts articulated her idea publicly outside the Netherlands -- in an interview with Ms. magazine last spring -- it generated headlines in four different countries, and the death threats started rolling in. When word of Gomperts's idea reached the island nation of Malta, where abortion is illegal, government officials vowed to prosecute anyone who assisted the Dutch doctor. The Web site Gomperts put up for her newly minted nonprofit organization, the Women on Waves Foundation, was promptly hijacked, redirecting visitors to a site that pictured bloody fetuses. More than once, Gomperts has been called a dangerous woman.
