With great sadness, we mourn the loss of Mark Lane, Fidelis Care President and CEO, who passed away unexpectedly on July 22. The tradition of the Catholic health care ministry found a new expression in Fidelis Care, and Mr. Lane guided the health plan to become an advocate, a resource, and an answer for uninsured children and adults of all ages. From the beginning, he expressed and instilled in each of us an uncommon passion for excellence, the highest attention to detail, and a steadfast commitment to the company's mission of serving the poor and most vulnerable with compassion, dignity, and respect. His vision for what Fidelis Care could be was realized not only in the company's growth and success over the years, but also in the lives that were changed by having access to quality, affordable health insurance. He cared about people from all walks of life - children, parents, college students, jobless adults who recently lost health insurance, the low-income elderly, residents of rural areas, and those in New York's largest cities - there was no population too small, no story too insignificant for his focus and attention. With one set of values, Mr. Lane lived life seamlessly. Whether as steward of a successful company, or as loving and devoted husband, father, and grandfather, the same uncompromised principles prevailed. We are grateful for his vision and the standards and expectations he established, giving each of us a foundation upon which to build as we go forward, day by day. This is how we will honor him; he will never be forgotten. - The Board and Staff of Fidelis Care New York", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  LANE, MARK"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "23", "word_count": 274, "_id": "50184dc71c22dfde670b35c6", "snippet": "LANE--Mark.
