One national survey, for example, has found that by 1982 the steady increase in the number of teen-age women having premarital intercourse that was noted in the 1970's had stopped. Among whites the percentage of teen-age women who engaged in premarital intercourse leveled off, while it declined among blacks, according to William Pratt of the National Center for Health Statistics. Another national survey, conducted by the National Opinion Research Center, reported an increase in the past four years in the number of people who believe extramarital sex is wrong, and it also found other, indirect evidence of less free attitudes toward sex: The number of Americans who favor sex education in the schools declined, and the number of people who oppose pornography on the ground that it leads to a breakdown in morals increased. Sociologists at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, report that the percentage of women students there who say they are virgins has increased over the last six years, after decreasing dramatically from the mid-60's to the late 70's.", "headline": {"main": "NEW STUDIES EXAMINE SEXUAL GUILT"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1702, "_id": "4fd1633c8eb7c8105d64eb95", "snippet": "FOR some months social observers have been intently watching as a range of indicators continues to suggest that the country has entered a phase characterized by more conservative attitudes toward sexuality than those of the two previous decades.  ...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/20/science/new-studies-examine-sexual-guilt.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SEX"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GUILT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Daniel", "lastname": "GOLEMAN"}], "original": "By DANIEL GOLEMAN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1985-08-20T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Science; Health"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Financial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "ARTHRITIS entered Ann DeGrout's life when she was 28.

Thirty years later, the disease is still with her. Arthritis has been an expensive companion. Mrs. DeGrout, a prim woman with quick eyes who lives in Clifton, N.J., buys about $200 worth of medication a year. She swallows eight to ten tablets a day of Ecotrin, a coated aspirin. Each morning, she takes 5 milligrams of Prednisone, a steroid that must be prescribed by a doctor. At least once a month, she must see her physician, which typically costs her $20 to $50. Lately, she has been showing up weekly. She has found it necessary to acquire a range of equipment to help her through the routines of daily life. She has a padded bathtub seat that cost her about $130. She spent $35 for a walker, $25 for a set of canes.
