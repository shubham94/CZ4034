Turn off the televised beatings, murders, knives, guns, chains, fires, cars hurtling off cliffs and victims being thrown out of airplanes, or simply turn away? Although definitive links are hard to establish, psychologists and other authorities in the field generally accept that watching violence on television can affect the way children view the world and the way they relate to others, that it can anesthetize their responses to cruelty and suffering or make them excessively fearful. Indeed some experts feel the connection is so strong that, as Arnold Kahn, administrative officer for social and ethical responsibility at the American Psychological Association, put it: ''The debate over the effects of violence on television watchers is like the debate over cigarette smoking and cancer.'' The association is the latest organization to join the National Institute of Mental Health, the Surgeon General, the National Parent-Teacher Association and others in warning parents to monitor their children's viewing habits. Recently, the American Psychological Association issued a resolution asking parents to do just that and asking the broadcasting industry to reduce violence in programs.", "snippet": "THE show is violent but the children are determined to watch, so what is a parent to do?
