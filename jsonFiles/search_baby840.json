The reason tics may be mild in one person with Tourette's and extreme in another, they said, has to do with variations in a brain chemical found in a small region of the midbrain. Those who are supersensitive to the chemical have severe tics -- they may twitch constantly, utter meaningless phrases all day long and might even leap across a table without warning. Those with a more normal response to the chemical appear to have mild tics -- a subtle shoulder shrug, a repeated clearing of the throat or tapping fingers in a repetitive pattern.", "headline": {"main": "Studies Pinpoint Region of Brain Implicated in Tourette's Syndrome"}, "abstract": "Scientists find variations in sensitivity to chemical dopamine in caudate nucleus region of midbrain may explain differences in severity of tics in people who have Tourette's syndrome, bizarre neurological disorder characterized by repeated rapid sudden movements or vocalizations; research, involving identical twins, is reported in journal Science; drawing (M)", "print_page": "3", "word_count": 1365, "_id": "4fd1f5ec8eb7c8105d7502a6", "snippet": "SCIENTISTS have found a possible explanation for the severity of tics in Tourette's syndrome, a bizarre neurological disorder characterized by rapid sudden movements or vocalizations that occur repeatedly in the same way.

Yasujiro Ozu and Akira Kurosawa each have their champions; but I concur with Jean-Luc Godard's opinion that Kenji Mizoguchi, who died in 1956, was ''the greatest of Japanese film makers; or, quite simply, one of the greatest film makers.'' Kurosawa himself felt that way: ''Of all Japanese directors, I have the greatest respect for him.''
