Since it followed a rerun of ''Two and a Half Men'' (15.29 million), which delivered a smaller audience than an original episode, ''Alex'' was down from its premiere (13.46 million, versus 14.9 million last week) but retained a good percentage of ''Men'' viewers. Fox was a strong second place for the night in total viewers and adults 18 to 49, with the strangely juxtaposed ''Skating With Celebrities'' (9.93 million) and ''24'' (13.76 million). On WB's soon-to-be-canceled ''7th Heaven,'' Sandy (Haylie Duff) gave birth to a son, and Martin (Tyler Hoechlin) decided to take responsibility for him after being mean throughout the pregnancy. The episode brought in 6.06 million viewers but failed to help the ratings of ''Related,'' which had an audience of a mere 2.42 million.
