Smoking has been banned in most public buildings, at work sites and on public transportation and is becoming increasingly unacceptable in restaurants, private homes and cars. Smokers, no longer welcome to light up with cocktails or coffee, while reading the paper or doing their work, are being forced to go outside when they can no longer resist the urge. Yet forty-six million American adults continue to smoke, mainly because nicotine, like heroin and crack cocaine, is an addictive drug. For smokers who have become dependent on nicotine, each dose -- each cigarette -- sets up a craving for the next one. If that craving is not satisfied, the smoker begins to experience withdrawal symptoms: anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, drowsiness, disturbed sleep, hunger and a strong urge for nicotine.", "snippet": "SMOKERS are finding it harder and harder to pursue their habit in socially acceptable ways.
