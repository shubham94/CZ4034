New Government data showed that the economy created 193,000 jobs in July, a somewhat slower rate than during the spring, pushing the unemployment rate for July up slightly, to 5.4 percent of the civilian work force, from 5.3 percent in June. Also, upward pressure on wages ebbed last month. Consumer spending fell during July for the first time since winter, and orders to factories fell in June for the first time in four months. $(Page 1.$) Prices of Treasury securities surged in response to the positive economic news, pushing the yield on the 30-year bond to a four-month low of 6.73 percent. $(45.$) Economist Links Jobs and Yields The monthly employment report seems to have a greater effect on stock and bond markets than any other single piece of economic data. In a study to be released on Monday, Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton University economist, measures the correlation between the interest rate on the 30-year Treasury bond and job creation. $(37.$) Wage and Health Bills Passed Lawmakers, rushing toward a monthlong recess, resoundingly approved bills to raise the Federal minimum wage by 90 cents, to $5.15 an hour, insure safer drinking water and make health insurance portable between jobs. They then sent the agreements to President Clinton for his expected signature. $(1.$) It's Still the Economy More than any other issue, the economy was Bill Clinton's ticket to the Presidency four years ago. With the country struggling to climb out of a recession, Mr. Clinton campaigned as the champion of the ''forgotten middle class.'' Now he is basing his re-election campaign on a much improved economy. $(1.$) Democrats contend that Bob Dole's tax-cutting package, expected Monday, is based on overly rosy economic predictions. The Dole camp sees its numbers as far more credible than the Democrats' assumptions. $(9.$) World Bank Studies New Role Taking the first step to stimulate the flow of billions of dollars in private capital to the developing world, the World Bank effectively set aside $250 million to start a new fund to guarantee new investment in poor countries against expropriation and other political risks. James D. Wolfensohn, the bank's new president, reasons that private investors would be willing to lend far more money to the developing world if their investment could be insured. The bank's executive directors like the idea, but final approval awaits a detailed plan. $(36.$) Ford Ordered to Pay Sanctions Ford Motor was ordered by a Dallas judge to pay $10 million in sanctions to the plaintiffs in a lawsuit related to a fatal car crash. The judge accused Ford of ''wrongful and abusive conduct'' during pretrial proceedings. $(37.$) Steroids, a Black Market Success Whenever the Olympic Games take the world stage, accusations about the use of performance-enhancing drugs are sure to follow. But world-class athletes -- if they take the drugs -- are not alone. An estimated 500,000 Americans, mostly young, white and male, spend $400 million a year in the black market on synthetic steroid hormones to improve their sports prowess -- or just to show off their brawn. Separately, there is a legal, medical market in the drugs. $(45.$) Dollar Falls Slightly The dollar ended slightly lower, settling at 1.4750 German marks, down from 1.4762 marks on Thursday, and 106.89 Japanese yen, down from 107.13 yen. $(38.$) Heating Oil Futures Rise Heating oil futures prices rose sharply to 58.71 cents a gallon, as traders worried about a possible winter shortage. $(38.$)", "headline": {"main": "BUSINESS DIGEST"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "35", "word_count": 603, "_id": "4fd1f2108eb7c8105d749347", "snippet": "Healthy Economic Growth Is Shown With More Jobs   The economy is avoiding overheating, showing instead signs of slowing to a moderate but still healthy pace while generating no increases in inflation.
