The defect by itself does not cause schizophrenia, the researchers said, but it could be one of the risk factors that combine to bring on the devastating mental illness. And because their research involved a brain structure that responds to nicotine, they also proposed a most unusual theory: that nicotine might provide fleeting relief for some of the distressing symptoms schizophrenics feel, which might in turn explain their well-documented tendency to smoke heavily.", "snippet": "SCIENTISTS have linked a genetic defect to a brain abnormality that might help explain a hallmark of schizophrenia: the inability to filter out irrelevant sounds and other distractions.
