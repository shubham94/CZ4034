Although it will be two more years before it is known whether the changes will, in fact, result in fewer heart attacks, the researchers expressed ''cautious optimism'' about the study's potential to demonstrate the combined life-saving effects of lowering blood cholesterol and blood pressure and of stopping smoking among men who fa ce a high risk of heart disea se. In smaller studies, independent changes in each of the factors have reduced the chances of premature death from cardiovascular disease. The $98 million study, referred to as ''MR FIT'' (for Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial), is sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. The largest project of its kind, it involves 12,866 initially healthy men being studied at 22 medical centers around the country.", "snippet": "Middle-aged men participating in a major national study have succeeded in changing their habits to reduce their risk of suffering a heart attack, according to a series of newly published reports on the study's progress.
