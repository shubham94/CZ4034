Relevant analysis has been undertaken at least since the late 1970's, with a number of economists now specializing in this. Their findings are sometimes frustrating, but, by no means conclusive, can be surprisingly useful. A first step is to determine all the costs of a terrorist attack. Sept. 11 clearly went beyond the loss of life, however tragic. The attack had serious economic consequences for consumer spending and airline travel. It had long-term consequences for the costs of insurance, new construction safeguards and airline security, to name but a few. It also took an emotional and psychological toll on the nation. In nations where terrorism is more common, experience shows that it deters foreign investment, and probably domestic investment as well. Tourism can be permanently reduced.
