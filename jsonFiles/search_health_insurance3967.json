Cash or Check? Imagine your company was in an industry whose products were so harmful to society that it was negotiating to pay $250 billion -- yes, billion; up there with the Federal budget deficit -- over 25 years to get itself off the hook. Sounds devastating, no? But when the possibility of a sweeping tobacco settlement broke into the open last week, shares of both Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco leapt more than 10 percent. That sum, you see, staggering as it sounds, at least sets a limit on the tab of the cigarette makers, which are under vast legal pressure to pick up a good part of the nation's health care cost from smoking-related illness. And remember that the tobacco giants practically mint money -- Philip Morris just reported profits of $1.77 billion for a single quarter. It brings to mind the cartoon that depicted Michael R. Milken, after agreeing to pay $500 million in compensation for his misdeeds, looking up at the judge with a wide smile and saying, ''Cash or check?'' ADVERTISING High Noon in Marlboro Country The people negotiating the tobacco deal are reportedly considering a ban on, among other things, human characters in ads. But that would be ''a deal breaker,'' one analyst said. ''There is no chance in the world Philip Morris would agree to do away with the Marlboro Man.'' The ''Marlboro Country'' ads, after all, have had a bigger impact on the world's smoking than any other campaign. (John Landry, who oversaw development of the Marlboro Country ads in the early 60's, died last week at 73.) STOCK MARKET 10%? Time to Buy Again The stock market has all these odd little myths and formulas. If something happens in January, something else is supposed to happen in June. If a certain team wins the Super Bowl, it's curtains for stocks. And, of course, there's the old 10 percent rule: if the Dow industrials ever drop 10 percent from their high, that's heavy-duty stuff -- not to mention the end of the bull market as we know it. For six long years -- the longest stretch ever -- the Dow has skirted such a fate, but last week it danced on the precipice. After ending the previous Friday down 9.8 percent, the Dow ventured down into the danger zone on Monday. But then investors -- duly programmed to follow their myth -- seemed to say, ''Hey, we've had our heavy-duty market drop; now the water's safe again.'' And the Dow bounded back to gain 60 points, and 135 more on Tuesday, and it kept rising most of the rest of the week. TAX RETURNS Sacrificing for Politics President Clinton, often accused of just saying what people want to hear, didn't miss a beat last week. For even as Americans were racing against the tax deadline and swearing at the tangle of forms, Mr. Clinton offered a plan to simplify the whole process. Sounds familiar. Politicians talk constantly of tax simplification. One fun thing about tax time, though -- yes, yes, it's a stretch to call any of it fun -- is that the simple folk get to peek at politicians' returns. Last year, both Mr. Clinton and Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani, powerful as they are, made far less than their wives. President Clinton had his $200,000 salary, but Hillary Rodham Clinton made $740,000 on royalties from ''It Takes a Village'' (most of which she has donated to charity). And while Mr. Guiliani's salary is $165,000, Donna Hanover made $259,000 as an actress and TV journalist. THE GREAT UNTAXED Well, There's Still Death Those First Families, of course, also paid hefty taxes -- they'd never try the type of shenanigans most Americans seem to believe are hidden somewhere in the fine print of the Declaration of Independence. You'd think, for instance, that people making over $200,000, no matter how much tax-return creativity they mustered, would have to turn over at least a few pennies to the I.R.S. Not so. In 1993, according to the latest I.R.S. data, nearly 2,400 Americans with such lofty incomes paid precisely nothing in Federal taxes -- nearly 30 times as many as in 1977. One way they did it: someone could, say, earn $1 million, but lose $1 million (on paper) on a real estate investment and wipe out any liability. So much for the alternative minimum tax, which was designed to wipe out such stuff. LIFE INSURANCE H.I.V. Policies, at a Price Life insurance for someone who's H.I.V.-positive? Forget it. No insurer would touch you -- until now, that is. Last week, Guarantee Trust Life, of Glenview, Ill., became the first to offer such coverage, recognizing that new drug therapies mean that AIDS is no longer hopeless. For now, the policies are offered only in Illinois, but later they may be more widely available, and those who contracted the virus through drug use aren't eligible -- the company deems them too risky. But here's the big catch: a $250,000 policy costs $1,500 a month, or $18,000 a year. WIRELESS PHONES Phone-aholics, Please Apply These ads for wireless phones are getting downright silly. As competition heats up -- with new rivals for Bell Atlantic Nynex and AT&T Wireless in the New York area, and with new goodies like digital service -- innocent bystanders are being bombarded with pitches that often include absurd numbers of free minutes. One, for instance, offers 1,000 free weekend minutes a month. Think about it. That's two full hours, every weekend day. How would you ever use that? Take a six-mile hike and talk to your broker the whole time? Sit at a Little League game and chat endlessly on the phone instead of watching the field? Farfetched? Not necessarily. Bargain-hunting Americans just hate to get something free and not use it. If phone companies were sincerely interested in quality of life, they might offer incentives for people not to use these gadgets. HEALTH CARE All-in-One Cancer Care Say you need a widget. You go to the widget store, which might well be owned, or at least managed, by the widget maker. Sounds reasonable. But is health care just another business? Should it be? With the rapid growth of managed care, of course, health is getting to be very much a business, and when you consider things like efficiency and economy of scale, that might well be a good thing indeed. But is there a limit? That was the question last week when Zeneca, the British company that's the world's No. 2 maker of cancer drugs, took over the operation of its 11 cancer centers in the United States. ''This arrangement is a first,'' one analyst said. And no doubt not the last. CONTINENTAL WORLD Coffee, Tea or Broadway? Just as Florida has Disney World, for years New York had Webber World (though purists insisted on calling it ''Broadway''). But when ''Sunset Boulevard'' closed a few weeks ago, suddenly Times Square no longer seemed like Andrew Lloyd Webber's private playground. Never fear, though: the urge to make it a theme park hasn't died. Now, if you please, call it Continental World. When you weren't looking, the theater district somehow turned itself into a brand name, and last week the new, improved Broadway landed its first national corporate sponsor -- Continental Airlines. What now? ''We plan to do this tie-in very tastefully,'' said the president of the ''official airline of Broadway.'' And a theater official vowed that there'll be no ''dancing airliners in the middle of shows.'' Only, presumably, at curtain time.", "headline": {"main": "DIARY", "kicker": "DIARY"}, "abstract": "Diary of business events of week ending Apr 20; graphs; photos; drawing (l)", "print_page": "2", "word_count": 1262, "_id": "4fd1f8d08eb7c8105d7554b1", "snippet": "TOBACCO WARS  $250 Billion?
