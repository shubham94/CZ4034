During WWII he served for four years in the US Army Air Corps as a navigator, rising to captain. After returning to the Prudential, in the words of former president Orville Beal, ``Bob Harvey had moved out of the Actuarial Department into Administration. Then I chose him to succeed me as head of sales operations for Prudential. That's quite unusual-to have an actuary as head of salesbut he was that kind of manhighly respected by everybody.'' Then came ``a very heavy blow.'' Near the top of the company, Harvey's career ended in 1967 following a tragic automobile accident. Beyond his activities in the insurance business, he served as Chairman, Scholarship Committee of Harvard; President, Health and Hospital Council of Newark and vicinity; and member, Boards of Directors, Life Office Management Association, Welfare Federation of Newark, and United Community Corporation (Newark). As part of his civic activities, Mr. Harvey worked closely with the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. on what he found to be ``one of the most stimulating and potentially rewarding fields of all,'' assisting urban youth in Newark. A man of admirable strength and perseverance, in the accident's aftermath he maintained his uncanny intelligence and wit along with love and care for his family.
