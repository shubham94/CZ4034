The advertisement reflects on the conditions of life for millions of Americans: distant, isolated, lonely. Loneliness is now a national epidemic, according to many sociologists and psychologists, who point to such contributing causes as our highly technological society where many workers interact more with machines than with other people; to our mobility, with the average American moving 14 times during a lifetime; to the impersonality of large urban settings where many people don't even know their immediate neighbors; to the prevalence of divorce, which now ends half of American marriages. Loneliness is not the same as being alone. A person can be just as lonely in a group of people as when home alone. And those who choose solitude may never be lonely.

The State Board for Professional Medical Conduct, part of the Health Department, found his conduct ''especially reprehensible'' in the case of a 10-year-old boy terminally ill with cancer of the brain. The board said that ''by holding out false hope,'' the doctor had persuaded the parents of the boy to remove him from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and take him to Whitestone General Hospital, a small proprietary hospital in Queens.
