I'm Marcia Kramer, political correspondent for WCBS-TV. Well, the stage is set, our candidates are here. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Rick Lazio. I'm joined by our panel of reporters who will be joining me in questioning the candidates. First, CNN senior political correspondent Jeff Greenfield; New York Daily News political columnist Lars-Erik Nelson; New York Times columnist Joyce Purnick; and representing The New York Post, political reporter Gregg Birnbaum. . . . Mrs. Clinton, figures from the Independent Budget Office show that New York State lost over $200 million in federal aid after Chuck Schumer defeated Senator Al D'Amato and New York no longer had a senator in the majority party. Since the Senate is expected to stay in the Republican hands, how would you deliver for the State of New York as a junior senator from a minority party, and a person that the Republicans would clearly want to humiliate?", "headline": {"main": "CAMPAIGN 2000: The New York Senate Debate; Excerpts From Second Debate Between Mrs. Clinton and Lazio"}, "abstract": "Excerpts from debate between New York senatorial candidates, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A Lazio, as recorded by The New York Times (M)", "print_page": "6", "word_count": 10255, "_id": "4fd21a248eb7c8105d7987ce", "snippet": "Following are excerpts from yesterday's debate between the New York senatorial candidates, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A.
