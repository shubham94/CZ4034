The answer, according to a study published in this month's British Journal of Sports Medicine: a mere 20 minutes a week of any physical activity, whether sports, walking, gardening or even housecleaning, the last not usually associated with bringing out the sunshine. The researchers found that more activity conferred more mental-health benefits and that \"participation in vigorous sports activities\" tended to be the \"most beneficial for mental health.\" But their overall conclusion was that being active for as little as 20 minutes a week is sufficient, if your specific goal is mental health.", "headline": {"main": "Phys Ed: How Little Exercise Can You Get Away With?", "kicker": "Well"}, "abstract": "How much exercise is needed to avoid feeling gloomy?
