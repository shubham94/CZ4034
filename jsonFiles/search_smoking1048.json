A tall man of 62, lean and fit, he particularly enjoyed running on such a day; his business, selling insulation supplies, was doing better than ever and his children and grandchildren were all thriving. As always, nearing home he broke into a sprint, but that day, to his surprise, he ended up gasping desperately for air. Alarmed, he went to his doctor and got bad news: an X-ray showed a large tumor on his right lung. A few weeks later, he was operated on. The tumor proved to be a pleural mesothelioma, a type of cancer; the surgeon removed as much as he could. Chemotherapy and radiation would buy Ed Morgan (not his real name) a little time, but the end was predictable.", "snippet": "JOGGING DOWN A NEW JER-sey park trail one morning, Ed Morgan felt wonderfully content.

Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink.'' In ancient Carthage, the law forbade bridal couples to drink on their wedding night. And in 1834, a report to the British House of Commons noted that infants born to alcoholic mothers had ''a starved, shriveled and imperfect look.'' But it was not until 1973 that medical scientists confirmed what people seem to have known for thousands of years: that alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman can damage her unborn child. That year two pediatric researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle rediscovered and named fetal alcohol syndrome. At first it was thought that only the offspring of heavy-drinking alcoholic mothers were at risk. Now it is known that even as little as two drinks a week may do damage, and knowledgeable physicians recommend that women abstain completely from alcohol from the moment they start trying to conceive until they are finished nursing. Even women who drank during previous pregnancies with no apparent ill effect on their offspring are cautioned against assuming that subsequent children will be similarly spared.", "snippet": "IN the Old Testament, Samson's mother is admonished by an angel: ''Thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
