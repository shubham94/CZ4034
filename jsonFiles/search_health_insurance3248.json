A private-public partnership to revive the city brightened parts of downtown by adding three sports stadiums and two museums, resurrecting shopping and converting warehouses into lofts. But that revival has been staggered by the loss of some corporate sponsors and the humbling of others. BP moved its United States headquarters to Chicago after buying Amoco in 1998, for example, and LTV, which is based here, sold its last mill in the city this year as part of its bankruptcy reorganization. Big manufacturers are still based here -- notably Eaton, Parker Hannifin and Sherwin-Williams -- but the boom of the 1990's mostly missed the city. Per-capita income rose 11 percent in the decade, but that was below the national average and only two-thirds of the rise recorded in cities that focused on services rather than manufacturing.", "headline": {"main": "BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Cleveland; Working To Regroup Around Technology"}, "abstract": "Travel article on Cleveland, Ohio; city's highlights noted; photo (M)", "print_page": "8", "word_count": 868, "_id": "4fd222f18eb7c8105d7a8640", "snippet": "Built on the steel, auto and chemical industries, Cleveland thrived through the 1950's -- and dived in the 1970's.

The American economy lost 43,000 jobs in September, the biggest drop since last February. Many people who were looking for jobs last year have given up. The ratio of jobs to potential workers continues to drop. Meanwhile, take-home pay is going nowhere; last year median household income dropped for the first time in a decade. Workers dependent on overtime, commissions or bonuses are watching paychecks shrivel. And ever-bigger portions of their paychecks are going for health insurance -- single coverage is up an average of 27 percent from last year, family coverage up 16 percent. Americans look to Democrats for more secure jobs and better wages. So why aren't the Democrats making Americans' economic worries more of an issue in the campaign? The basic problem is that Democrats don't have a coherent view about what ails the economy and what to do about it. Some of them accept the supply-side belief that taxes are too high on corporations and the affluent and voted in favor of the Bush administration's huge tax cut. Most other Democrats cling to the neo-Hooverian orthodoxy of the 1990's that federal deficits are inherently bad. In their view, the tax cut is largely to blame for the prolonged recession because it put the federal budget in the red. They want to restore ''fiscal responsibility.''", "headline": {"main": "Quick Tax Relief for an Ailing Economy"}, "abstract": "Op-Ed article by former Labor Sec Robert B Reich says three weeks before Election Day, most American households are still mired in recession, with take-home pay shriveling and unemployment rising; says Americans look to Democrats for more secure jobs and better wages, but Democrats lack coherent economic policy; suggests best way to help workers and revive economy is to get more money into consumers' pockets by cutting payroll taxes for two years, beginning immediately (M)", "print_page": "27", "word_count": 681, "_id": "4fd2396d8eb7c8105d7cd38c", "snippet": "Three weeks before Election Day, most American households are still mired in recession.
