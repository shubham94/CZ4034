For the research, investigators tallied the results of dozens of studies about the effects of exercise on the so-called fat gene, which is believed to increase the risk that carriers will be overweight or obese by 12 percent or more. Scientists first identified this gene, called the ''fat mass and obesity-associated'' gene, or FTO gene, several years ago, and as it turns out, it's distressingly common. By most estimates, about 65 percent of people of European or African descent and perhaps 44 percent of Asians carry some version of the FTO gene.", "snippet": "Just in time for Thanksgiving, a major new study offers some hopeful news about fat and fate, as well as about the consequences of the choices we make.
