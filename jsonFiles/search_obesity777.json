During this year's long and frigid winter, many of the city's public elementary schools canceled outdoor recess, instead keeping students inside where they watched videos (and snacked). At my son's school in Manhattan, children stayed indoors -- where they killed time in the gymnasium -- through much of April, too, because of rain. Wouldn't these children have been better off playing outside? The standard justification is that students tend to get sick in cold weather. But there's little evidence that cold weather itself causes illness (unless you're talking about frostbite or hypothermia, which can be prevented with proper attire). It's exposure to sick people in cramped quarters (like school classrooms) that's bad for your health. Not to mention what sitting indoors all day does to your metabolism; no wonder childhood obesity is on the rise. And of course, there are the behavioral problems: children get antsy without fresh air.", "snippet": "As New York City emerges from a spring cold snap, parents unwrapping their children from winter clothes may find something unexpected underneath: a new layer of fat.
