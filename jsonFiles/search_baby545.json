The morning before, my fourth grandson, ''Baby T,'' aka Tennyson, entered the world at a robust 8 pounds 14 ounces. His Apgar score five minutes after birth was 9 of a possible 10, indicating good color, good muscle tone, good health. But two hours later, his life hung in a precarious balance. An observant nurse noted that his color was ''not right'' -- pink above the chest but grayish below. Minutes later, the neonatologist told my daughter-in-law that her baby, who initially seemed perfectly healthy, was now ''very, very, very sick and could go either way.''", "headline": {"main": "Four Scary Days With a Newborn Grandson", "kicker": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 1216, "_id": "4fd2414d8eb7c8105d7d9997", "snippet": "Persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns is considered rare, but it is surprisingly common, afflicting an estimated 1 baby in 700.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/21/health/21brod.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BABIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LUNGS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Jane", "middlename": "E.", "lastname": "BRODY", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By JANE E.

Within a few years, a new class of pain relievers, the so-called COX-2 inhibitors, burst onto the market with the promise they might reduce that toll.
