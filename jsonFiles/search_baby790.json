There could be no more compelling argument for an expansion of support for new parents and of quality child care programs. Studies have long stressed the importance of early intervention, from prenatal care to preschool, to promote the healthy development of children. But many people have accepted the notion that the brain has been genetically determined by the time a baby is born, and that what is most needed in the first few months is love and care. Research by neuroscientists, however, shows that after birth, experience counts even more than genetics. The way in which billions of brain cells make connections and develop into networks that enable children to become smart, creative and adaptable depends, to a remarkable extent, on how an infant is nurtured.", "headline": {"main": "Nurturing Development of the Brain"}, "abstract": "Editorial says new evidence that speaking to very young infants has profound effect on brain development and ability to learn is compelling argument for expansion of support for new parents and of quality child care programs (M)", "print_page": "14", "word_count": 412, "_id": "4fd20ee48eb7c8105d780c87", "snippet": "At an unusual White House conference earlier this month, scientists, doctors and sociologists discussed new evidence that speaking to very young infants has a profound effect on brain development and the ability to learn.
