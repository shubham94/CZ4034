But that estimate was based on a highly debatable assumption -- that Congress would adhere to onerous spending caps it set in 1997 to achieve a balanced budget. Those caps were broken open this year, a measure of the difficulty in meeting them. If scrupulously observed the next two years, the caps would require Congress to cut non-military discretionary programs by an astonishing 30 percent and then maintain the programs at that level for the next decade. Virtually no one expects Congress to inflict that much pain. Under the more reasonable assumption that Congress keeps current programs intact, there will be no federal surplus. Yet Bill Bradley said that future surpluses would pay for his $650 billion, 10-year program of universal health insurance. George W.

For all that, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue seems to radiate an aura of isolation and missed opportunities these days. Presidential friends speak of his ''lonely voice'' on the telephone. Mr. Clinton's two closest political associates -- Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton -- do not want him hovering as they launch their new careers. The image of a home-alone presidency was reinforced when Mr. Clinton was asked if he felt mournful about starting his final year in the White House. ''When I go in a room in the White House now I look around more carefully to make sure . . . that I've actually noticed something that I may not have seen.'' He added, ''I wish I didn't have to sleep at all for a year.'' Like all retiring presidents, Mr. Clinton will experience a cruelly abrupt loss of power at this time next year. But the winding down of this presidency -- a 12-month process that began Thursday -- has its own special poignancy. Mr. Clinton entered office on a wave of generational optimism that was tamped down by incrementalism, triangulation, partisanship and the devastating X-factor of his own indiscipline. Nothing he said in his first Inaugural Address about breaking the hold of special interests in Washington will be quoted as often as ''I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' Friends and political allies speak with increasing openness about how he disappointed them. Historians are beginning to categorize Mr. Clinton as a politician of splendid natural talent and some significant accomplishments who nonetheless missed the greatness that once seemed within his grasp.
