The proportion of patients with Kaposi's sarcoma when they were diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome had dropped to 14 percent through April from 34 percent in 1981, when AIDS was first identified, and Federal health officials and other experts say they do not know why. One possible explanation, researchers say, is that there may be an unknown factor in addition to the AIDS virus that puts homosexual men at risk for Kaposi's sarcoma, and that exposure to this co-factor is declining, perhaps as a result of safer sexual practices among homosexual and bisexual men. Researchers are planning new studies on Kaposi's sarcoma and AIDS. Federal health officials and other scientists say that if they can explain the striking decline of Kaposi's sarcoma, they might not only identify a drug or some other factor that acts in concert with the AIDS virus to cause the cancer, but also learn why some AIDS patients with Kaposi's sarcoma seem to fare better statistically than those who do not have it.", "headline": {"main": "SCIENTISTS ARE PUZZLED BY DECLINE OF A RARE CANCER IN AIDS VICTIMS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1383, "_id": "4fd172c68eb7c8105d666cf0", "snippet": "Kaposi's sarcoma, the cancer that was one of the original clues to the existence of AIDS, is mysteriously declining in its prominence among patients with the deadly disease.
