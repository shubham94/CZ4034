The proposal is certain to be popular, but there is a worrisome catch. The cost of the rebate would grow from $200 million the first year to $1 billion annually in five years, raising questions about whether the money will be there to pay for it if the economy turns down. Mrs. Whitman's zest for tax-cutting is a signature of her career and crucial to her claim for consideration as a nominee for Vice President in the next national election. She first ran in 1993 on a pledge to cut the income tax, and then kept her word by using budget gimmicks to make up for the lost revenues. Her past tax cuts now amount to about $1.2 billion in annual lost revenue. Currently she proposes to cut taxes in the next five years by nearly as much as in the last five. But since Mrs. Whitman cannot run for a third term, it will probably be up to her successor to deal with any adverse long-term consequences of her actions.
