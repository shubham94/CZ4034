One floor below them, thousands upon thousands of eggs and larvae, in shallow, water-filled trays, are hatching to produce more and more mosquitoes. From the minuscule salivary glands of those mosquitoes, scientists of New York University are harvesting malaria parasites, as part of an intense international research battle against malaria - one of the world's most severe and persistent health problems. The disease affects many millions throughout the world. Though the exact number of cases is unknown, experts agree that the total is enormous and that the disease is an important factor in keeping the third world poor and deprived. Yet efforts to attack malaria by drugs and mosquito eradication may well be failing. Moreover, the possibility that a vaccine might be developed that would work against malaria has been regarded for years as remote, akin to reaching for the moon.", "headline": {"main": "MALARIA STILL A WIDESPREAD SCOURGE, BUT HOPE GROWS FOR VACCINE TO DEFEAT IT"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1598, "_id": "4fd11ee88eb7c8105d5de3da", "snippet": "ALMOST every day, in an old brick building on East 25th Street, research workers sit before microscopes dissecting the salivary glands of mosquitoes.
