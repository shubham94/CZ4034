THE FACTS -- As the number of Americans using cellphones has soared in the past few years, concerns about a link between the phones and cancer have continued to grow. According to the American Cancer Society, about 30 percent of the population believes there is a connection, though no link has ever been conclusively demonstrated. The fear was ignited about a decade ago, when several brain cancer patients filed lawsuits claiming that their illnesses were caused at least in part by electromagnetic radiation from their cellphones. Those who claim a link say the phones create harmful electromagnetic fields and point to a slight rise in the incidence of brain tumors in recent years. While it is impossible to prove that electromagnetic fields are safe, experts say that the amount of radiation the phones emit is too low to pose a serious health threat, and several epidemiological studies appear to confirm this.", "headline": {"main": "REALLY?"}, "abstract": "Link has not been established between cellphone use and increased risk of brain cancer; long-term research is called for; drawing (S)", "print_page": "5", "word_count": 350, "_id": "4fd2801a8eb7c8105d84abc0", "snippet": "THE CLAIM -- Cellphones increase the risk of brain cancer.
