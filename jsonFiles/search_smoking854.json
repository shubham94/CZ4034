There is no question that asbestos inhaled over a long period in significant quantities can cause cancer or lung disease. But the health risks posed by a few days, or even months, of attendance in schools with asbestos where the exposure could be limited are negligible, they said -- less than the statistical likelihood of developing AIDS or being killed by a mugger, a drunken driver or a bolt of lightning. Indeed, the dangers to children while playing in the streets while out of school are probably greater than the risks of spending a few days in a school while officials establish whether asbestos is present.", "snippet": "The decision to delay the opening of New York City's schools while they are inspected for asbestos was based more on a need to reassure fearful parents than on any estimate of health risk in this situation, health experts and school officials say.  ..."}], "meta": {"offset": 0, "hits": 1, "time": 37}}}
