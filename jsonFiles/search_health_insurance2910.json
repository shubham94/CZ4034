Outside experts who have studied the Kerry proposal say that is not the case. WHAT BUSH SAYS In Downingtown, Pa., yesterday, Mr. Bush said the Kerry plan ''involves bigger and more intrusive government.'' He said it would ''expand the government's health care rolls by nearly 22 million,'' leading to ''the largest expansion of government health care in American history.'' He said ''8 out of 10 people'' who obtained health coverage under Mr. Kerry's plan ''would be placed on a government program'' and small businesses would have the incentive to drop their private insurance and throw people into government programs. He said the Kerry plan would cost $1.2 trillion. THE FACTS Mr. Kerry's plan has three main elements: an expansion of Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, both programs for the poor, so that all children and more low-income adults would be covered; an arrangement so individuals and small businesses not now eligible for group plans could buy private insurance now available to federal employees; and government rebates to employers to cover most of the cost of catastrophic health insurance claims (over $30,000 per beneficiary in 2006). Asked whether this would amount to a government-run health system in the United States, John Sheils, a vice president of the Lewin Group, an independent consulting firm, said, ''No, I don't think so.'' Mr. Sheils said that ''97 percent of the people who have insurance now would have the same coverage.'' The Lewin Group specializes in health issues, and its finding that the Kerry plan would put more than 20 million new people under government health coverage was mentioned by Mr. Bush in last week's presidential debate. The vast majority of the 20 million would be children in low-income families. It would hardly be the largest expansion of government health insurance in history, much less than the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960's and involving fewer people than even Mr. Bush's legislation enacted last year to offer prescription drug coverage under Medicare. The Kerry plan would actually make health insurance less expensive for small businesses because they would be able to take a tax credit to offset 50 percent of the cost of offering employees coverage and because the catastrophic coverage would lower the payments for premiums. The cost of the Kerry plan is a point of dispute. The Kerry campaign puts the cost at $653 billion over 10 years. Whatever the price tag, most if not all of it would be offset by Mr. Kerry's proposal to repeal tax cuts for the 2 percent of taxpayers with incomes over $200,000.", "headline": {"main": "THE 2004 CAMPAIGN:  Taking a Closer Look at Bush's Attacks on Kerry's Health Care Plan", "kicker": "Fact Check"}, "abstract": "Fact Check column on how Pres Bush is characterizing Sen Kerry's proposed health care plan; explains how plan would work (M)", "print_page": "18", "word_count": 461, "_id": "4fd2a4858eb7c8105d88ac6c", "snippet": "Most of the cost of John Kerry's health care plan would be offset by repealing tax cuts for the 2 percent of taxpayers with incomes over $200,000.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/22/politics/campaign/22fact.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BUSH, GEORGE W"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KERRY, JOHN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEALTH INSURANCE AND MANAGED CARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTION ISSUES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2004"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "David", "middlename": "E.", "lastname": "ROSENBAUM", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By DAVID E.
