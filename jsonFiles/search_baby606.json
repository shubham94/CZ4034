Nausea was nothing new. I had been throwing up constantly -- sometimes as often as 12 times a day -- throughout my pregnancy, but that night something felt different. If I had had to describe my symptoms right then, I would have resorted to the familiar vocabulary of illness -- I was dizzy, my heart was racing, I felt short of breath. I guess. The truth is, those words felt generic and crude, unequal to the task. What I felt was more elemental, as if my bodily organs -- mysterious, essential things I knew I had but couldn't feel -- had begun to malfunction in some subtle, unspeakable way. For the next few hours I lay on the bathroom floor throwing up, letting the tile cool my body as it shook uncontrollably after each episode, first freezing, then burning.
