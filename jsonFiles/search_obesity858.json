An analysis of the mouse genome that was published last week by an international consortium is almost as important because only by comparing the human genome with those of other species can scientists extract the fullest understanding of how genes operate. Best of all, mouse genes can be easily manipulated in the laboratory, making it possible to conduct genetic experiments that would be ethically untenable to perform in people. The mouse is not the closest cousin to humans, but there is an enormous amount of similarity in their genomes. Mice and humans have roughly the same number of genes, about 30,000, and 99 percent of these genes are closely matched. That is because both mice and humans inherited the genes from a common mammalian ancestor some 75 million years ago, in the era of the dinosaurs. Although the genes governing such basic biological functions as organ and blood development seem to be the same in both species, mice have far more genes involved in the sense of smell, sexual reproduction and immunity against pathogens. That presumably reflects the challenges and dangers mice faced as they evolved separately from humans over tens of millions of years.", "snippet": "Two years ago scientists opened a vital new frontier when they announced that they had largely deciphered the human genome.
