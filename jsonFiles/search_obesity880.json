They believe, right or wrong, that what such stores offer is more healthful, cleaner, safer and higher in quality, and may also be better for the environment. As a result, natural food supermarkets have been springing up around the country like dandelions on a suburban lawn. But as they have increased, they have also evolved. Some are more ''natural'' than others; some offer better quality than local supermarkets, and some don't. In a sense, the stores face the same problem as natural foods themselves: how much is about branding, and how much about delivering what the consumer expects from the name?", "snippet": "AS confidence in the safety of the commercial food supply has declined in recent years, consumers have increasingly sought their own remedy: the modern natural food store.

Like her fellow investigators on the Harvard Nurses' Health Study -- a 25-year project that has produced a trove of medical findings -- she has become a believer in the preventive power of exercise. But for Dr. Manson, a 48-year-old professor at Harvard Medical School, the great delight in the study's findings about heart disease was the realization that ''no pain, no gain'' is a myth -- that even moderate exercise makes a big difference. The Nurses' Health Study began in 1976, when more than 120,000 nurses filled out questionnaires about their habits and their health. The survey has continued with questionnaires every other year, generating a vast array of information about heart disease, cancer and the effects of lifestyle choices like exercise, diet, alcohol and smoking.", "snippet": "DR.
