Nothing was known of the soldier's motive. Yasir Arafat, who had refused telephone calls from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, expressed his condolences and proposed a meeting. A1 The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution to censure Israel's plan to build a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. A12 Albanian Officials Arm Civilians The Albanian authorities opened weapons warehouses in the capital to arm civilians who they hoped would help defend the government. Residents barricaded themselves inside their homes, gunfire rattled across the capital, and people bid up the prices of the last food supplies, awaiting chaos. President Sali Berisha and opposition parties appealed to the European Union and NATO to send peacekeeping troops. A1 French Find Child Smut Ring The French police detained more than 250 people and confiscated some 5,000 videocassettes in their largest operation to date to fight child pornography. Those charged with possession or trafficking in pornography involving minors were all men and included two school directors, two teachers and several others who work with children. A4 Berlin Seeks to Expel Refugees The city authorities of Berlin, uneasy with its population of Bosnian war refugees, ordered two refugees deported to Sarajevo, a symbolic gesture signaling a much greater forced exodus. The expulsion was the first since some 700,000 Bosnian war refugees fled to Germany as fighting engulfed their homeland in 1992. A7 House Votes to Punish Mexico The House voted to impose sanctions on Mexico for its failures in the war on drugs, while senators and the Clinton Administration worked to reach agreement on a statement that would call for progress by Mexico but carry no penalties. Senate members offered a nonbinding resolution as an alternative to reversing President Clinton's finding that Mexico had fully cooperated with United States drug prevention efforts. A10 Gunmen Kill 13 in Egypt Four gunmen opened fire on a road in Egypt, killing 13 people. Islamic militants were suspected. The assault occurred in a mostly Christian village 300 miles south of Cairo and was one of the highest death tolls in a single shooting since Muslim militants began a violent campaign to oust Egypt's secular government. (AP) Chernobyl in Financial Trouble The Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine cut its power output by half because it lacked the money to buy fuel. It may have to shut operations in a month. (AP) NATIONAL A14-27 White House and G.O.P. Revert to Budget Deadlock The White House and Congressional Republicans deadlocked again over the Federal budget. The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott, declared President Clinton lacked the courage and leadership to deal with one of the main issues, saving billions of dollars by reducing inflationary cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other benefit programs. Mr. Clinton has decided not to look into recalculating how inflation is measured. A1 Turnabout on Sexual Identity A case once cited as proof that sexual identity comes from one's surroundings now is thought to indicate the opposite: that the sense of being male or female is innate. The case involved a boy who was reared as a girl after his penis was accidentally cut off. The child was thought to have accepted a female identity. But researchers revisited him, now in his 30's, and found he had renounced his female identity at 14 and had chosen to live as a man. A1 Man Charged in Cosby Death A Los Angeles teen-ager was charged in the Jan. 16 roadside slaying of Ennis Cosby, Bill Cosby's son. Investigators said the killing apparently resulted when the man, Mikail Markhasez, 18, attempted to rob Mr. Cosby after happening upon him as he labored to fix a flat tire. Police Chief Willie L. Williams credited a tip received a month ago by The National Enquirer. A1 Hatch Backs Kennedy Bill Senator Orrin G. Hatch endorsed a Democratic initiative written mainly by a colleague considered his ideological opposite, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, to provide health insurance for half the 10 million children who lack it. His announcement gave the bill, which would increase the Federal tax on tobacco to finance the coverage, a major boost. A24 F.B.I. Follows Bomb Leads The F.B.I. released images of nine people who were in Atlanta's Olympic Park before the pipe bomb explosion in July that killed one and wounded 111. Agents stressed that the people shown were probably witnesses and said they mainly wanted to learn if those shown knew anything relevant. A14 Praise for Endowment for Arts The National Endowment for the Arts won praise in House hearings for changes in its management. House Republicans had vowed to end its Government financing this year, and it is still unclear whether it will survive. But members of the subcommittee holding the hearing seemed satisfied with it. A22 Hearing Turns Into Bickering The hearings of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Anthony Lake's nomination to be Director of Central Intelligence dissolved into bickering after one Democrat, Bob Graham of Florida, said the committee was spending too much time asking about things like Iran's arms shipments to Bosnia and whether Alger Hiss was guilty. A24 NEW YORK/REGION B1-5 Deal Struck in Albany To Dismember Con Ed New York State regulators and Consolidated Edison agreed on a sweeping reorganization that would break the utility into several pieces and give deep rate cuts to large industrial customers. Homeowners would get smaller cuts. B1 Caution Urged on Cloning Fertility specialists, medical ethicists, a former Nobel Prize winner and John Cardinal O'Connor, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, lined up to urge New York State legislators not to act hastily in curtailing or regulating research into cloning. B2 Missile Theory Rebutted Again The head of the National Transportation Safety Board went on television to rebut claims that a radar tape showed a missile hitting T.W.A. Flight 800. The board's chief air investigator said so much of the jetliner's center fuel tank had been pieced together that it was not possible a missile passed through it. But the investigator said it was theoretically possible that the tank had been hit by a missile fragment. B2 Forget Me Elmo; Buy Beanies The craze for Beanie Baby toys reached a peak that many New York-area toy sellers said they had never seen before. The tiny stuffed animals cost just $5 each, but there are 77 varieties, and many children are trying to collect them all. B1 SPORTS B8-17 L.I.U. and Princeton Lose Long Island University's appearance in the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament was brief: it lost the opening round to Villanova, 101-91. Princeton, reverting to its traditional form, fell just short, losing to California, 55-52. B9 WEEKEND C1-34 BUSINESS DAY D1-15 Dow Loses 160 Points Stocks plunged in the sharpest selloff since July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 160.48 points, or 2.3 percent, as fears spread that interest rates would rise. D1 Rock Chosen Over Hard Place Wal-Mart's Canadian subsidiary decided to resume selling Cuban-made pajamas, choosing to violate the United States embargo on Cuba rather than a Canadian law that bars compliance with the embargo. Wal-Mart's headquarters in Arkansas said the Canadian unit was defying its orders.

A bill under consideration in the House would revoke President Clinton's certification of Mexico as fully cooperating in fighting drug trafficking. But the White House threatened a veto, even though the bill would allow Mr. Clinton to waive the legal effects of the decertification, and the likelihood that it would pass appeared to be dwindling. A1 Key Testimony in Drug Case A former Mexican police officer, testifying in a civil trial in Houston, identified a former deputy attorney general of Mexico to whom he said he delivered narcotics protection money in 1994. It was the most important testimony to date in the case, in which United States prosecutors have been constructing an image of systematic narcotics corruption, showing Mexico's law enforcement officials as being in the pay of drug traffickers. A12 Rebels Near Albanian Capital Rebel gunfire pressed closer to the Albanian capital, Tirana, where gangs carried off weapons from two military sites and Western embassies organized evacuations. Looters also stormed an arms depot near Elbasan, 22 miles southeast of Tirana. In the oil refining center of Ballsh, 50 miles from the capital, insurgents plundered an armory and took control over a main highway through southern Albania. A5 Nigeria Charges Dissidents Nigeria's military Government charged a Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka, and 11 other dissidents with treason in connection with a series of bombings of army installations. The charge against Mr. Soyinka carries a potential death penalty, though he fled Nigeria in November 1994 and lives abroad. A6 Peru Talks Deadlock Talks to bring a peaceful end to the hostage crisis in Peru broke down, with both sides saying they had failed to agree on important points. While the discussions had been expected to produce the outlines of an agreement toward ending the crisis, the meeting ended with no progress. It was the first meeting since talks broke down over rebel allegations that the Government was building tunnels to attack them. A13 Israeli Premier 'Fed Up' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel declared he was ''fed up'' with charges that his actions had violated the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. The Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, who has apparently refused to talk to Mr. Netanyahu, prepared to convene a meeting in Gaza to discuss the peace agreements; Israel was not invited. A10 The United Nations Palestinian observer opened a General Assembly debate on the Israeli Government's plan to build a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem by condemning the plan as illegal. A11 NATIONAL A16-24, B9-11 President Shelves Plan For Price Index Commission Administration officials said President Clinton had decided to shelve the idea of establishing a commission to look into recalculating the cost-of-living adjustments in the consumer price index, which studies said was overstating inflation. A1 U.S. Tipped on Lobbying Plan The Government began to investigate China's lobbying efforts early last year after the National Security Agency picked up hints about China's effort, including its willingness to funnel money to American politicians, law enforcement officials said. They said the hints were discovered while eavesdropping on conversations between Beijing and Chinese officials in the United States. A1 Transportation Plan Announced The Clinton Administration announced a six-year transportation plan that would raise the amount of money available for maintaining major highways, including interstates. Other elements of the proposal would increase money for enforcing truck safety and drunken driving laws. Overall, it would increase spending on transportation by $17 billion from the amount in the previous six-year plan. A16 Republicans Seek New Budget The Republican majority in the House endorsed a nonbinding resolution to require the White House to submit a second budget for the coming year. Congressional analysts have described the first one as flawed by overly optimistic assumptions about the economy. The White House said it had no intention of offering a new budget and called on the Republicans to propose their own alternative. B11 Philadelphia Worries Over Trial Testimony concluded in the trial of two men in the killing of a 26-year-old jogger in Center City Philadelphia in November 1995. The defense focused on allegations of misdeeds by the police, leaving some Philadelphians worried that the guilty would go free and others fearing that the real killer was still at large. A16 Restraint Urged on Cloning Ban Scientists and ethicists testifying before a Senate panel urged Congress not to rush to ban research on the cloning of human beings. The specialists, including Dr. Ian Wilmut, the Scottish scientist who announced the first cloning of a mammal, said there was no immediate crisis because the methods for sheep would have to be made much more efficient before being used with humans. B11 High Court Rebuffs Muslims The Supreme Court rejected a Muslim group's request that it remove a 66-year-old marble depiction of the prophet Mohammed from its courtroom. Islamic tradition discourages artistic renderings of people, especially Mohammed. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said he had decided against removing the work but would change the Court's literature describing it. (Reuters) NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Albany Democrats Propose Big Rise in School Spending The Democratic leaders of the New York Assembly proposed increasing school spending by more than 50 percent over five years. The proposal, using money from an unexpected boom in income tax receipts, would make preschool available for all 4-year-olds in the state. Governor Pataki and the Republican-controlled Senate want to use the money for property tax relief instead. B1 Gay Partners' Benefits Denied An appeals panel ruled that Rutgers University did not have to provide health benefits to the domestic partners of five gay employees. The ruling, which ultimately could affect all New Jersey state employees, said the benefits plan for state workers extended only to legal spouses. B4 New Charges for Nightclub King Peter Gatien, whose Manhattan nightclub empire was partly shut down after his indictment on Federal drug charges, was arrested again. State prosecutors said he had cheated New York City and State out of more than $1.3 million in taxes. Mr. Gatien's lawyer said there was a legitimate explanation. B2 Protest Over AIDS Classes Students and their advocates passed out condoms and demonstrated in front of more than 30 New York City high schools. The students said many of their peers do not receive mandated health classes on AIDS. B3 Plan Announced for Airport Link The Port Authority said it expected to start construction this summer on a rail line to Kennedy International Airport. The Giuliani administration, which also wants a link to La Guardia Airport and can stall the plan if it chooses to, complained. B7 HOME C1-11 ARTS C13-20 New Battle Over Arts Funding The chairman of a House subcommittee said he planned hearings on what he called the National Endowment for the Arts's support for ''repugnant'' art. He spoke as more than 400 artists and representatives of arts organizations lobbied Congress for more money for the arts. C13 SPORTS B12-19 N.F.L.
