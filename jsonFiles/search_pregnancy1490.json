''We had a good meeting,'' he said. 1 Trying Times for Afrikaners Many Afrikaners, the descendants of Dutch, German and French settlers who ruled South Africa for most of this century, are groping for honorable berths in the new order. None are finding it easy. 1 Japan Pressed to Aid Asia Japan is suddenly the target of criticism for not doing enough to restore stability to Asia. Policy makers in Washington say Japan needs to act vigorously to stimulate its economy and clean up its banks. 3 20 New Catholic Cardinals Pope John Paul II elevated 20 men to the rank of cardinal. He received 19 of them in person, from 13 countries. Another was in a hospital. Two others were chosen in secret. 4 C.I.A.'s Self-Criticism The C.I.A.'s long suppressed inquest into the 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco has finally come to light.

Gittins, the civilian defense counsel for Sgt. Maj. Gene C. McKinney, who is facing court-martial at nearby Fort Belvoir on 19 counts of sexual misconduct and obstruction of justice, pushes the envelope, in the vernacular of his former career as a Marine Corps pilot. Yet Mr. Gittins, 41, is Sergeant Major McKinney's fiercest defender. He threatened, before the court-martial, to name top Army officers allowed to retire quietly after sexual misconduct accusations, unlike Sergeant Major McKinney. 12 Judge Is Praised in Inquiry Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson who oversees the investigation into the relationship of President Clinton and Monica S. Lewinsky in Federal District Court in Washington is seen as a firm guardian of procedure who has little tolerance for violations of proper legal behavior.
