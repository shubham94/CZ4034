So, in January, when a new one arrived fresh from Maine -- Senator Susan M. Collins -- people of every political stripe rushed to win her over. A Nike lobbyist, seeking to protect the company's low-wage sneaker factories in Asia, wanted a meeting with Collins before she formulated a Most Favored Nation policy. Her Roman Catholic bishop in Maine called right before her first vote on ''partial birth'' abortions. But it was the Senate's two mavericks on campaign finance reform, the Republican John McCain and the Democrat Russell Feingold, who asked the biggest favor. For months, McCain and Feingold had been searching for a third Republican senator to sponsor their bill aimed at ending those huge campaign contributions known as soft money that have been at the center of so many recent political scandals. They knew Collins had called for reform during her Senate race and wanted to get to her before the Republican leadership could muzzle her. ''The first time Russ Feingold and I met,'' Collins said, ''he had all my statements I'd made during the election in favor of campaign finance reform -- he was carrying around this whole stack of Xeroxed clips about me. It was eerie.'' Feingold was struck by how quickly Collins grasped the complexities -- PAC limits, free air time for candidates, compliance incentives. ''So many discussions with senators are, 'Give me the answer' or 'Tell me how to vote,' '' said Feingold, a former Rhodes scholar. ''She enjoyed the substantive discussions you hope for as a senator but almost never find.'' She is 44, has never married and works almost all the time, to the point that her aides worry privately that she has virtually no personal life. She'll go to sleep fretting about how to modify the McCain-Feingold bill to make it more acceptable to her and wake with new statutory language. ''Just as I was dozing off,'' she said, ''I had this idea about the free television provision, and I was afraid I'd forget in the morning, but I was too much on the verge of sleep to write it down. Next day we had a big abortion vote -- it went totally out of my mind. But next morning, I got up -- it was back!'' At first glance, Collins appears to be an unlikely figure to defy her Republican leadership. She is a prim, earnest woman with a schoolmarm's reserve, a middle-of-the-roader from little Caribou, Me., who has spent most of her work life as a government bureaucrat or Congressional aide and had never held elective office until her Senate victory in November. But Susan Collins felt a personal passion for campaign finance reform. In a Senate where well over one-third of the members are millionaires, she is a woman of more limited means. Before entering the Senate, the most she ever earned was $90,000 a year. She drives a '92 Honda Accord, and owns a home in Bangor bought two years ago for $88,500. In the 1994 Maine governor's race she was defeated by a multimillionaire and faced two multimillionaires in the Senate Republican primary in 1996. ''When I ran for the Senate, I seriously debated whether I could afford to keep my $160-a-month health insurance,'' she said. ''I considered borrowing from my parents, but I was 43 and didn't want to unless I was desperate.'' More than once, the Senate Republican leaders Trent Lott and Mitch McConnell -- the prime defenders of rich Americans' first amendment right to donate unlimited amounts of cash to any politician -- personally asked Collins not to be a co-sponsor of the reform bill. One Republican Senator said to her, ''Promise me you're not going to be a problem on this one, Susan.'' She was furious at his condescension even as she smiled at him. ''People sent me here to make a difference,'' she recalled. ''People think the system stinks and they're right.'' Still, she did promise to inform Lott and McConnell before signing on to a reform bill. ''If there's one thing the leadership hates, it's surprises,'' she said, sounding like a cross between Everett Dirksen and Miss Manners. And she made the call, although just a few hours before the news conference announcing her decision. (Besides being well mannered, the Collinses of Caribou are politically shrewd; Susan Collins's father was a state senator, her mother the mayor, her uncle a state supreme court justice.) ''You don't want to give these guys time to cook something up,'' she said, rushing off to the biggest news conference of her young political career. Washington seems to be in a political funk these days, although it is possible that the capital is simply experiencing a period of sustained moderation. In times of prosperity, citizens look less to government for dramatic help or big ideas. Bill Clinton learned this in his liberal phase, when he tried to rework health care; Newt Gingrich learned it in his Contract With America phase, when he tried to remake Medicare and environmental regulation. Polls show that a growing number of voters don't think along party lines and that many feel it's not so bad to have a Democratic President and Republican Congress, making politicians who can forge consensus quite valuable. ''I'm consistently sought out by both sides for co-sponsorship of bills,'' said Collins, who has so little seniority that she ranked 99th out of 100 senators when it came to being allotted offices. ''I have a lot of power -- I like that.'' National columnists as different as Mary McGrory of The Washington Post and William Safire of The New York Times praised her independent spirit in March, when she was one of the first Republican senators to defy Lott and call for wide-ranging hearings into both parties' improper fund-raising practices. Her instincts were good: Lott backed down. Now on the Senate committee investigating campaign fund-raising, she is getting national exposure for the first time. In the way she commands her colleagues' respect, Collins is reminiscent of Bill Bradley, the former Senator. She is not charismatic -- like Bradley, she comes across as too cerebral, too goody-goody, too focused on facts to elicit a strong emotional response. Instead, she leads through the force of her ideas and her ability to see an issue fresh. At a meeting in early May in the office of the Democratic minority leader, Tom Daschle, nine moderate senators were going round and round in search of a middle ground on abortion when Collins hesitantly raised her hand. What if they tightened the standard for permitting a third-trimester abortion from being conditional on the health of the woman to being conditional on the physical health of the woman, she suggested. This would mean that a more loosely defined health problem -- like being depressed about a pregnancy -- would no longer be justification to abort. There was silence. ''No one said anything, then Daschle spoke against it, and I thought I was shot down,'' Collins said. Her aide Priscilla Hanley recalled, ''I could see she felt dissed.'' Then on the way out, Senator Mary Landrieu whispered, ''You're right, I'm going to call you.'' Soon after, Collins was contacted by the Democrats Joseph Lieberman, Christopher Dodd, Byron Dorgan and Barbara Mikulski and the Republican Olympia Snowe, all saying they liked her idea. Later, Daschle came on board, then President Clinton. In the end, the compromise was defeated. Moderates were forced to vote on a ''partial birth'' abortion ban. Despite extraordinary pressure -- 6,000 anti-abortion messages delivered to her office -- Collins held to her pro-choice view, one of only four Republicans to do so. Moderation is more than the political distance from liberal or conservative; it is also a particular temperament, a worldview, a personal chemistry. Susan Collins was raised by her parents to take the moderate course. ''With my children, I tried to stress, 'Don't be carried away by the emotion of the moment,' '' said Patricia Collins, the sort of mother who sent her daughter the senator ''Angela's Ashes'' to read. (''Before it won the Pulitzer Prize,'' Patricia Collins points out.) The Senator's mother is Catholic, her father Universalist. ''My husband goes to his church,'' said her mother, ''I go to mine.'' Patricia Collins drew a line on how Catholic her six children would be, refusing to send them to religious retreats. ''I didn't want their commitment to the church to be emotional,'' she said. ''I wanted it to be intellectual. I'm afraid of politics or religion that's too emotional.'' As religious education coordinator for Holy Rosary Parish years ago, Patricia Collins introduced a junior-high filmstrip that discussed how biblical creation and Darwin's natural selection were compatible, and then she faced down creationists who demanded that it be withdrawn. Caribou, a town of 10,000, is about as far north as you can go in Maine without being in Canada. Winters are long. As a teen-ager when miniskirts were fashionable, Susan Collins would arrive home from school with red wind burns on her legs. The Senator's younger brothers, Sam and Gregg, are the fifth generation of Collins men to run the family's small lumber business. Collinses were expected to excel. The children grew up in an upper-middle-class home decorated with their mother's sophisticated watercolors. Young Susan took piano and dance, and impressed adults. Margaret Butterfield, the town librarian, was delighted to hire her as an aide when she was in high school. ''We had trouble with some of the girls,'' Butterfield said. ''They'd wear those sun dresses that showed too much and were not, you know, permitted by the library trustees. I never had a problem with Susan Collins. She was so calm for a young girl.'' But the Collinses have also known failure, which has fed their moderation, making them more understanding of others' failures. While five children are successful, Michael, the oldest son, has twice served prison terms for drug dealing -- arrested the second time in the midst of his sister's 1994 campaign. ''Michael was never straight -- it was just something inside him,'' his mother said. ''But Michael is just as much our son as Susan is our daughter. Michael keeps us humble. I'd be quite smug if I hadn't had Michael. I'd think environment is everything.'' While Senator Collins's challenges to the Republican leadership make headlines, the ideas that place her at the heart of her party were molded by the family business. She wants to cut estate taxes so families can more easily pass on a business to the next generation. She opposed last year's 90-cent minimum wage increase as more than small business could afford. Through the family business, Collins has developed close ties with the American Forest and Paper Association, which has put her at odds with environmentalists on issues like clear-cutting. In May, after she delivered a spirited speech in support of timber interests to that trade group in Washington, the moderator gushed, ''During the campaign, Senator Collins came to Washington and asked us for help, and she's never let us down!'' Timber and paper companies were her largest contributors, donating more than $80,000 of the $1.6 million she spent for her Senate race. (Collins says that until there is reform, she must play by the current fund-raising rules.) Maine has long produced independent-minded politicians. It was from her predecessor in the Senate, William Cohen, a Republican who as a junior member of the House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach President Nixon and today serves as Clinton's Defense Secretary, that she learned how to practice political moderation. Collins was his aide for 12 years and saw that he was free to stray from Republican orthodoxy because he had made himself indispensable to his party as a well-informed hawk on military spending. She knows that she must develop some expertise that will ally her with party conservatives. For now she is able to trade on being one of only three Republican women in the Senate. Senator John Ashcroft, a conservative Republican, sought her sponsorship on the family-friendly workplace bill, which would allow a business to give compensatory time off, rather than overtime pay, for extra hours clocked. Conservatives tout the bill as a godsend for women who want more flextime; labor warns that employers will coerce nonunion workers into turning down overtime pay. The bill is going nowhere -- President Clinton has promised a veto -- and by sponsoring it, Collins will cause herself only trouble. Come the next election, union leaders will remember. But she got on board to do her share for the party. ''They wanted a woman out front on this,'' she said, ''so I did two press conferences and a floor speech for them.'' Moderation has its perils, too, as Collins knows firsthand. There is a strong ''live and let live'' attitude among Mainers, and during the 1994 governor's race, all three major candidates, including Collins, supported gay rights. However, it was Collins whom the Republican right attacked most viciously. ''It's like they feel more offended when it's one of their own,'' she said. She attended a fund-raiser for herself at the Underground, a gay bar in Portland, outraging the Christian right. Whispering began about the single woman running for governor. A reporter asked point-blank if she was gay. (Though aides felt the question deserved no answer, Collins replied that she is not.) B.J. Broder, a gay activist who attended the Underground fund-raiser, said that, in fact, very few people showed up: ''And the ones who showed were not moneyed people. In the gay-lesbian community there's not a lot of appreciation for Republicans. you hear a lot of ostracizing of people who are openly Republican -- rude remarks.'' After her '94 defeat, Collins took a $55,000-a-year administrative job at Husson College in Bangor. In 1995 the Maine Lesbian-Gay Political Alliance voted to give her an award for her support. She turned it down, telling reporters that since she didn't agree with the group's entire agenda -- including gay marriage -- she felt it would be hypocritical to accept the award. Broder said that's not the reason Collins gave him. ''Susan told me the real reason was she had a new position at Husson College and they wanted her to keep a low profile, not get into controversy.'' Broder still has the plaque Collins wouldn't accept. It reads: ''Susan Collins: Courage. Integrity. Service.'' ''It's going to happen,'' collins said of campaign finance reform. ''It's a stealth issue people care about.'' It is also an issue that could turn nasty for Republicans. The McCain-Fein-gold bill she has signed onto probably needs six or seven more Republican sponsors, besides her and Senator Fred Thompson, to team with Democrats if it is to pass. a battle is likely with her leadership over each new Republican recruit. Already the issue has caused more conflict for Collins with her majority leader than is healthy for a freshman. In a February fund-raising letter, Lott promised donors that for $5,000 they would get access to several Republican senators at an upcoming round-table event. ''Special emphasis is being put on insuring that all nine of our newest Republican senators are in attendance,'' Lott wrote. ''Like you, many of them are just beginning to step into the top ranks of Republican leadership, and I am sure that over the years you will share many special moments together.'' This, however, was one special moment that they would not share with Collins. She felt that the letter's wording was ''inappropriate'' and did not attend, citing a previous commitment. Is she still on good terms with Lott? she was asked during a quiet moment in her office. ''I hope so,'' she said. ''I think he understands a conservative Republican couldn't be elected in Maine. I think he understands I like him on a personal level. I'm sure I'm frustrating to him at times. I sure hope he understands.'' She spent the week after Memorial Day in Maine. Wherever she went, she spoke of campaign finance reform, and there were signs that she was making progress. At a fancy fund-raiser for Cumberland County Republicans at the Woodlands Country Club, the biggest applause of the night came when Collins called for campaign finance reform. At the opening of her Augusta office, 150 Republicans reacted most strongly when she mentioned that President Clinton had used the Lincoln Bedroom to raise $10 million for the Democrats and when she added: ''I want a very broad investigation, whether Republican or Democrat. There are problems on both sides.'' While the current system favors wealthy donors, even some of Maine's big money Republicans, like Dick Dyke, applauded her stand. Dyke, a manufacturer of assault weapons, approves of Collins's pro-gun stands -- including her support for overturning the ban on certain assault weapons. He and his associates donated $14,000 to her campaign. ''He told me he thought getting behind reform is the best thing I'd done,'' she said. ''These corporate types don't mind a $5,000 PAC or $1,000 personal donation, but they get very tired of having to put up $25,000 of company profits.'' If there is to be reform, the final step is getting television interested. That has not even happened in her home state. Feingold offered to fly to Maine in June to stump for reform, but Collins's aides couldn't get assurances from the Portland stations that they would cover the visit, and she told Feingold it was too early. That week in Maine, a discouraging reminder of big money's corrupting influence came during a visit to Manchester Elementary School near Augusta. After Collins showed the 75 students in the multipurpose room how to find Caribou on the map, she asked what they want to be when they grow up. Every hand shot up. ''A veterinarian!'' one child said. ''Olympics gymnastics coach!'' said another. A marine! An Air Force stealth bomber pilot! A paramedic! A firefighter! A mover! ''That's great, great,'' Collins said, beaming. ''Do any of you boys and girls want to be politicians when you grow up?'' Not a one.", "headline": {"main": "A Moderate's Moment"}, "abstract": "Profile of freshman Sen Susan Collins of Maine; moderate Republican is being wooed by people of every political stripe as balance of power in Congress shifts to middle; her co-sponsorship of campaign finance reform bill defies Republican leadership; photos (L)", "print_page": "18", "word_count": 3050, "_id": "4fd1d0458eb7c8105d709a9d", "snippet": "It is the moderate Republicans who hold the balance of power in Washington now, the moderate Republicans who are considered up for grabs on every big vote.
