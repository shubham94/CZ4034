How does a person get cancer? How does a person get fat? How do we see? What do animals think? How was life on earth created? The place, the Rockefeller University, is hushed, churchlike, serene. There is barely a whisper of sirens and traffic on the 15-acre campus of London plane trees, with shrubs and flowers and stretching green lawns. The university is an experiment itself - an experiment in the life style of science. Conditions are kept optimal for scientific discovery. The basic unit is the laboratory - there are no departments and hardly any classes. Everyone, from the top scientists to the graduate students (there are no undergraduates) works on a laboratory project.", "snippet": "On a wooded plot of land behind an elaborate wrought-iron gate at 66th Street and York Avenue, some of the world's most brilliant scientists are trying to solve such puzzles as: How does a canary learn to sing?
