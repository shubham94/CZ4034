Lowry, the director of the Museum of Modern Art, in his adjoining essay titled ''The State of the Art Museum, Ever Changing.'' Mr. Lowry's conventional but refreshingly honest commentary states that museums are ultimately about a rarefied experience -- and questions if it is feasible or desirable for museums to ever be used and enjoyed by all. Proponents of esthetic populism should heed this well. Experiments aimed at democratizing high culture remain a serious threat to the institutional status quo, and it is far too early to think that real change is at hand.", "headline": {"main": "A Risky Business", "kicker": "THE STATE OF MUSEUMS"}, "abstract": "Letter from Gregory Sholette, former Curator of Education for New Museum of Contemporary Art and a co-founder of REPOhistory artists collective, comments on Marcia Tucker's Jan 10 article Museums Experiment With New Exhibition Strategies", "print_page": "4", "word_count": 418, "_id": "4fd1f4058eb7c8105d74cc57", "snippet": "To the Editor:     Marcia Tucker's article ''Museums Experiment With New Exhibition Strategies'' [Jan. 10] makes an impassioned argument for art institutions to assist diverse audiences in becoming collaborators in the production of culture.
