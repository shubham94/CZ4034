Vikings 4-0 Packers 4-0 Green Bay's Mike Holmgren has everything a coach could want: a Super Bowl ring, a great quarterback and a terrific front office. But there is one thing he does not have--a winning record against Minnesota's Dennis Green. In fact, Green is the only coach in the N.F.C. Central with a winning record (7-5) against Holmgren. The Packers are impressive -- no, scary -- at home. They've won 25 straight at Lambeau Field and 18 straight against the division at home. Their last home loss to a division opponent? The Vikings in 1993. It is an omen the Vikings are well aware of. Green knows how to beat the Packers, and Minnesota has what Green Bay does not: a running game. Robert Smith has 384 yards rushing on 75 carries. He's the difference. Vikings, 27-26 SUNDAY 1 P.M. Miami (3-0) at Jets (1-2) Many are starting to believe that Miami is a legitimate Super Bowl contender. Jimmy Johnson is one of the best evaluators of talent the game has ever seen, and he has built a fast, tough defense that allows a conference-low 241.3 yards a game. That's what this game will come down to - Miami simply has the better defense. Vinny Testaverde will start at quarterback again this week for the Jets. Curtis Martin and Keyshawn Johnson will keep the game close. Dophins, 16-10 Carolina (0-3) at Atlanta (2-1) Carolina is in deep trouble because this game has loss written all over it. The biggest reason is that Atlanta Coach Dan Reeves always beats the teams he should. Atlanta has won 7 of its past 9 games by beating up on the dregs of the National Football League. Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler set a team record last week with a touchdown pass in 15 straight games. This will be 16, and the Falcons will win easily.
