Scott Savage of the San Jose Police Department's narcotics unit paid a visit to the newest tenant in the modest one-story professional building at the corner of Meridian and San Carlos: the Santa Clara County Medical Cannabis Center. Sergeant Savage, who has the upbeat demeanor of a young suburban cop (think ''Adam-12'') and wears polo shirts to work, has one of the more unusual jobs in American law enforcement. He is responsible for developing a set of regulations and procedures to govern the distribution of medical marijuana in San Jose, work he likes to describe as ''very creative'' and ''a thinking man's game.'' Since November, when voters in California overwhelmingly approved Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, it has been legal under state law for any ''seriously ill'' Californian to obtain marijuana upon the recommendation of a physician. Ballot initiatives are a famously messy way to make law, however, and the language of Prop 215, which took shape in the marijuana-smoke-filled rooms of San Francisco's notorious Cannabis Buyers Club, is even wispier than most. It doesn't explain exactly how the marijuana is supposed to find its way from the field to the patient without breaking state laws not addressed by Prop 215. During the campaign, California's Attorney General, Dan Lungren, had predicted ''legal anarchy'' if Prop 215 were to pass.", "headline": {"main": "Living With Medical Marijuana", "kicker": "The Pot Proposition"}, "abstract": "Michael Pollan article on varied implementation of California initiative legalizing medical use of marijuana by seriously ill people; notes rules are evolving as Clinton Administration works to insure failure of experiment; contrasts city-licensed dispensary in San Jose, with more free-wheeling approach to distribution in San Francisco; profiles patients, including San Francisco prosecutor Keith Vines, who say the benefit from marijuana, doctors who prescribe it, growers who hope to profit from legalization and police officers working to implement it; photos (L)", "print_page": "23", "word_count": 8953, "_id": "4fd1d0458eb7c8105d709a9c", "snippet": "One morning in May, Sgt.
