(BBC America) MY FAMILY The seventh season of this popular British sitcom begins with the 2006 Christmas episode. Ben (Robert Lindsay, left), the dispirited West London dentist, tries to get out of holiday obligations by pretending to be sick. But his wiseacre wife, Susan (Zoe Wanamaker), insists that he go to the doctor, who decides to run tests. Ben's private hospital room isn't too shabby, but he can't say the same for the crowded ward where he's sent when it's discovered that his health insurance has expired. 1 A.M. (13) DOC Harold L. Humes, right, known as Doc, went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at 16; founded The Paris Review with George Plimpton and Peter Matthiessen; wrote the political novels ''The Underground City'' and ''Men Die''; helped create the New American Cinema Group; championed the use of medical marijuana; designed a paper house that was both fireproof and waterproof; managed Norman Mailer's 1961 run for mayor of New York; and, after becoming mentally ill in the 1960s, reappeared as a hippie philosopher and paranoid, who insisted that the government was keeping tabs on him. Turns out it was. The filmmaker Immy Humes tells the story of her father.", "headline": {"main": "WHAT'S ON TODAY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 709, "_id": "4fd268548eb7c8105d81e393", "snippet": "8 P.M.
