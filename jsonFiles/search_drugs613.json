He was being cared for by an extraordinary doctor: Seymour Lipsky, then chief of hematology at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Dr. Lipsky did not have a private practice, but he had volunteered to take care of my father, telling us to call him whenever we felt we needed him. When we called, he came to the house. My father's drug bills were being paid by the New Haven Cancer Society. We had long used a nearby pharmacy, but now the pharmacist grumbled whenever we came. Dr. Lipsky, new in the state, did not yet have a narcotics license, so he wrote his prescriptions and another doctor signed them. The pharmacist complained about this.
