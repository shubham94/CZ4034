Richmond, M.D. --formerly Surgeon General of the United States. Dr. Richmond over his long, diversified and splendid career did as much as anyone to protect and improve the health of his fellow citizens, and in particular children and adolescents. From 1953 to 1965 Dr. Richmond was chairman and professor of the Department of Pediatrics at the State University of New York, SUNY College of Medicine and became dean in 1965, serving in that capacity until 1970. In 1965 Dr. Richmond was appointed by President Johnson as the first national director of Project Head Start in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Head Start became a year-round program after the first summer; approximately 750,000 children are enrolled in Project Head Start each year in approximately 1,500 centers across the United States. Head Start is a comprehensive child development program. In 1971 Dr. Richmond was recruited by the Harvard Medical School where he became a professor of psychiatry and human development and chairman and professor of the Department of Social and Preventative Medicine. Simultaneously, he was appointed professor of public health in the School of Public Health at Harvard. While at Harvard, Dr. Richmond was honored to receive a presidential dual appointment as both Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. Both positions required senate confirmation. Dr. Richmond was the first individual ever selected to occupy both positions. He had the responsibility in the federal public health sector for some 50,000 employees. During his tenure as Surgeon General, Dr. Richmond focused on tobacco control efforts through the publication of the 1979 Surgeon Generals Report, presenting overwhelming scientific evidence of the multiple harms caused by smoking. Dr. Richmond has received a number of honorary degrees including ones from Yale and Harvard. He continued his professional activities as the John D. McCarthy Professor of Health Policy Emeritus, monitoring students and colleagues, right up until the last couple of months. He continued to teach and write, striving to shape health policies for health promotion and disease prevention, with a special emphasis on children and families as well as the low income population. Dr. Richmond was a brilliant, caring, hands-on pediatrician for nearly 70 years. In later years he took on the onerous task of continuing to educate the public by testifying in open court about the dangers of tobacco and how the industry had for decades manipulated scientific data. In doing so Dr. Richmond voluntarily subjected himself to many days of grueling cross-examination, and he did this while refusing to accept compensation as a skilled expert witness. As Chairman of FA MRI's Medical Advisory Board, Dr. Richmond was vital to the Board of Trustees in helping to direct over $200,000,000 in grants to some of the finest medical schools and research institutions in America and the world --including five Centers of Excellence. The scientific research is aimed at eradicating the diseases caused by exposure to second hand tobacco smoke, the money having resulted from a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of nonsmoking flight attendants against the tobacco industry. Dr. Richmond had one of the most extraordinary and productive careers in the history of American monitoring science and public education. His professional accomplishments were mirrored by his sterling character traits. His sense of humor was legendary as was his refusal to acknowledge his own importance. He was endlessly patient, civil, tolerant, incredibly well-informed and a true pleasure to be around. The members of the Board of Trustees of FA MRI are eternally grateful for the guidance of Dr. Richmond over the past decade as well as for the pure pleasure of his company and insights.
