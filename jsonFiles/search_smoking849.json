While few would dispute the value of fitness in warding off heart disease and osteoporosis, when it comes to the immune system the facts are not nearly so clear. Nonetheless, millions of people believe that regular exercise keeps them healthier. Many avid exercisers insist that their fitness routine helps them ward off colds and recover more quickly from the minor illnesses they do get.

Although these sales are only 3 percent of total tobacco sales, they tempt minors, the fastest-growing group of new smokers.
