But the researchers and other experts cautioned against rushing out to buy the vitamin supplements before further clinical trials confirm that they are beneficial and safe. The studies, by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, showed that initially healthy people with the highest daily intakes of vitamin E developed coronary disease at a rate about 40 percent lower than comparable men and women whose intake of this vitamin was lowest. The preventive effects of vitamin E occurred independently of any change in blood levels of cholesterol.", "snippet": "Two new studies of more than 120,000 men and women strongly suggest that supplements of vitamin E can significantly reduce the risk of disease and death from fat-clogged coronary arteries.
