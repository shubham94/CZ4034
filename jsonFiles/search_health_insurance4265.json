Prosecutors believed they had a strong case and filed a motion for summary judgment in 1993, seeking an immediate decision from Federal Judge I. Leo Glasser on whether he would decide the case without a trial. But two years and four months later, the Federal prosecutors and the village are still waiting for Judge Glasser's ruling. So are dozens of others with civil cases. Some people have been waiting as long as 11 years for the judge to reach his verdict in their nonjury trials. A1. NEW YORK CITY CITY'S RISING COSTS FOR HEALTH BENEFITS New York City gives its employees better health benefits than most other cities and states, and could save $600 million by, among other things, making workers and retirees pay part of their insurance fees, a private group concluded in a report. The Citizens Budget Commission said the cost of health insurance for the city's 1.1 million employees, retirees and dependents has become one of the fastest-growing parts of the budget. The city pays $1.5 billion a year, or nearly 5 percent of this year's $31.8 billion budget, in this area; a decade ago, it paid $474 million, only 2.5 percent of the budget. B3. COUPLE ROBBED AND BEATEN IN QUEENS A liquor store owner and his wife were bound with wire, beaten and threatened at gunpoint but refused to tell two armed robbers the combination to a safe they kept in their modest home in Fresh Meadows, Queens, leaving the men to carry it off Saturday night, the police said. The safe had about $40,000 in cash and jewelry, a police spokesman said. B3. A CALL FOR HELP: REAL OR A HOAX? The call for help came at 2:46 A.M. A homeless man in a wheelchair, perhaps a double amputee, had been shoved into the Harlem River just under the Triborough Bridge and left to drown. A firefighter plunged into the frigid water and, battling the swift current and the water-soaked weight of his gear, snapped a life belt onto the apparently helpless man and hoisted him to safety. But was everything about this case really as it seemed? The Police Department does not think so. B3. ON THE AVENUE FOR A CLOUDLESS EASTER On the Avenue, they strolled in and out in the Florentine-gold sunlight like people in a song, sweeping picture brims and straw boaters, chapeaux ribboned and feather-plumed, toques, berets, top hats and Panamas -- a passing parade of creamy-parfait color for spring: lemon-lime, strawberry-orange, cranberry-rose. It was a nearly perfect Easter, a day without brass bands or beery pomp, a day to step into the rotogravure and notice a woman's windblown hair or the geography of an old man's face. The sky was cloudless, as blue as an amateur's painting, and a chilly wind seemed to justify the new spring coat, the white gloves, the face uplifted to a warming sun streaming between the skyscrapers. B3. REGION FIRST 100 DAYS FOR A FRESHMAN Just before the end of their first 100 days in Congress, freshmen Republicans like Michael P. Forbes of Long Island gathered for a mini-seminar on how to be re-elected. The presentation was a good reminder, Mr. Forbes said, that even as freshmen Republicans look back, cheering, on their first dizzying months in Congress, they cannot lose sight of the future. B6. RE-CREATING THE FACES OF TRAGEDY Frank Bender is among a handful of artists who lend the skills of their hands and eyes to the police in the United States and Europe. For two decades, he has helped to identify the victims of accidents and foul play, and he is particularly skilled in showing the effects of age and time on a person's face. The \"faces of tragedy,\" as Mr. Bender calls them, line his studio walls. \"Sometimes I'm the last one to get to know these people,\" Mr. Bender said. \"For everybody, there is somebody out there who cares what happened to them,\" he added. \"No one deserves to be buried without a name, without dignity.\" B6.
