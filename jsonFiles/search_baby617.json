(Holt, $23.) The link between reading and adultery, refined and elaborated since Flaubert, governs affairs in this rewarding, concentrated first novel about a voraciously literate 29-year-old Englishwoman and her family and her glamorous childhood friend (and the friend's boyfriend, who may be no reader at all). THE ADVENTURES OF MILES AND ISABEL. By Tom Gilling. (Atlantic Monthly, $23.) A beguiling novel that celebrates a young 19th-century Australian who thinks he can build a flying machine; his opposite number, Isabel, is fairly skeptical about flight but not about love, and both of them are suckers for a good supply of dreams. AFTER NATURE. By W. G. Sebald. (Random House, $21.95.) A book-length poem in which the painter Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald, the naturalist Georg Steller and the author himself inhabit a meditation on the sources of the catastrophic imagination, the continuities between nature and human nature, and issues of coming into being and passing away. AFTER THE QUAKE: Stories. By Haruki Murakami. (Knopf, $21.) The six stories in this slim collection about the emotional aftershocks of the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, which killed more than 4,000 people and left nearly 300,000 homeless, are apt to resonate eerily in an American reader's inner ear, though they were all written before Sept. 11. AGAPE AGAPE. By William Gaddis. (Viking, $23.95.) The first word in the title of this brilliant posthumous not-really-a-novel has three syllables and refers to love in and of the creation; the book is a kind of farewell summa or parting meditation on life, death and the player piano, seen as a mechanical forerunner of digital computing. AT SWIM, TWO BOYS. By Jamie O'Neill. (Scribner, $28.) Two great causes -- free Ireland and a free gay nation -- coincide in this polished but energetic novel built on the hazards of love, heroism, history and tenderness, and placed in political and moral history by the Easter Rising of 1916. THE AUTOGRAPH MAN. By Zadie Smith. (Random House, $24.95.) Smith's entertaining second novel studiously avoids the glorious excesses of her first, ''White Teeth,'' offering instead a lone protagonist (a half-Jewish, half-Chinese autograph trader from North London) and a single quest narrative (a journey to New York in search of a reclusive 1950's starlet). BAUDOLINO. By Umberto Eco. (Harcourt, $27.) Eco's Bildungsroman, set in the Middle Ages, includes some of the author's familiar obsessions -- forged manuscripts, fake relics -- and features several bizarre episodes and characters of impeccably historical origin. BEDLAM BURNING. By Geoff Nicholson. (Overlook, $26.95.) A lively novel involving madness, false identities and the nature of authorship (Nicholson's 13th novel; he should know). Its narrator, a handsome chap, agrees to impersonate his friend, a weedy novelist, and winds up in a lunatic asylum. BE MY KNIFE. By David Grossman. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) A brilliant concoction by an outstanding Israeli novelist whose hero, a 33-year-old married man, persuades a woman to undertake a brutally honest love affair to be carried on, in a political and physical vacuum, entirely by correspondence. BET YOUR LIFE. By Richard Dooling. (HarperCollins, $25.95.) A forceful novel by a writer and lawyer based in Omaha, who leaves room for ideas as well as characters and action as two men and a woman, all insurance investigators, crusade against so-called ''viatical'' policies, in which fatally ill people, strapped for cash, sell their policies at deep discounts. BIG IF. By Mark Costello. (Norton, $24.95.) A novel offers an anthropological look at the occupational rituals and argot of a group of Secret Service agents, who are in fact simply stressed-out working stiffs just like us, with the small difference that they are also charged with the continued well-being of the vice president. BLESSINGS. By Anna Quindlen. (Random House, $24.95.) In this persuasive and gently humorous novel, the discovery of a newborn baby girl left in a cardboard box creates opportunities for redemption and renewal for the handyman who finds her and for the dowager on whose estate she was abandoned. THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS. By Paul Auster. (Holt, $24.) Metaphysics and mystery run free in this novel so full of levels that A narrates B narrating C narrating his own story, which is in a movie; the plot concerns a missing silent film comedian who has gone unmissing and a movie scholar who pursues him. BY THE LAKE. By John McGahern. (Knopf, $24.) The sixth novel in 40 years of careful, lapidary production by this elegant Irish writer concerns the passage of a year in an unnamed Irish village, a couple who have returned to it and a community for which the biggest event of the entire year is the arrival of a telephone pole. THE CADENCE OF GRASS. By Thomas McGuane. (Knopf, $24.) McGuane's first novel in 10 years shows, as his work in the 1970's did, people responding with comically awful behavior to a hostile but also zany universe; there is a plot, concerning some kind of infernal legacy, but the digressions the author can never resist are, fortunately, deft and funny no matter how irrelevant or inconsequential. CAMOUFLAGE: Stories. By Murray Bail. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $20.) Fourteen stories by an Australian who invests his space in satire, not character; in one story people hold races on the partitions of their office cubicles, while in another a conceptual artist offers to document the existence of everyone alive. CARAMELO. By Sandra Cisneros. (Knopf, $24.) A cheerful, fizzy novel whose heroine and narrator joins her large Mexican-American family in driving from Chicago to Mexico City and back every summer; colorful generalizations abound concerning the borders of language and culture that they cross when they must. THE CAVE. By Jos\u00e9 Saramago. (Harcourt, $25.) The cave in mind is Plato's, where shadows pass for realities; the characters in Saramago's latest novel live in a complex where they work, shop and enjoy simulated experiences, victims not just of global capitalism but of their own eagerness to go along. CENTURY'S SON. By Robert Boswell. (Knopf, $24.) The world rolls on in recrimination and mourning in this novel of four generations, the first represented by a Russian dissident full of falsehoods, the second an unhappy couple, the third an adolescent suicide and a 15-year-old mother. CHILD OF MY HEART. By Alice McDermott. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) In East Hampton, sometime in the early 1960's, the teenage narrator of McDermott's novel concentrates on a few summer days and a lot of baby-sitting; a growing awareness of the adult world and its risks is foreshadowed rather than understood or displayed. A CHILD'S BOOK OF TRUE CRIME. By Chloe Hooper. (Scribner, $24.) An ambitious first novel by an Australian, in which an adulterous affair between a schoolteacher and a student's father runs parallel to an affair that ended in murder 20 years earlier. There is cause to be ill at ease, since the wronged wife in affair No. 1 has just published a book about affair No. 2. THE COLLECTED STORIES. By Clare Boylan. (Counterpoint, paper, $16.50.) A fascination with things strange but true drives Boylan's shrewd plots; her settings range from the early Victorian period to Margaret Thatcher's Britain, but she is most at home among the working-class Irish of the 1960's and 70's. THE COMPLETE WORKS OF ISAAC BABEL. Edited by Nathalie Babel. (Norton, $39.95.) The total product of the marvelous writer who tried to create a synthesis of the Russian, the Jewish, the literary and the revolutionary, a mix that bestowed life on his fiction but could not save him from death on Stalin's orders in 1940. THE CRAZED. By Ha Jin. (Pantheon, $24.) A devoted student tries to untangle the stroke-induced ravings of his teacher in the months before the demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in a novel that gently underlines the hardships endured in contemporary China. The Crimson Petal and the White. By Michel Faber. (Harcourt, $26.) A 19-year-old prostitute is the central character of this novel in which an empty and befouled late Victorian world is successfully confronted by nothing more than wit, determination and a good heart. The narrator, our educator and guide, examines the inner thoughts of the book's inhabitants until we learn to understand them for ourselves. CROW LAKE. By Mary Lawson. (Dial, $23.95.) This ambitious first novel combines two standard motifs -- sudden orphanhood and rescue by an inspiring schoolteacher -- in an exploration of class and sibling rivalry, ennui and persistence, especially in the character of Kate Morrison, who rises against tall odds to an academic career she actually has little heart for. DARLINGTON'S FALL: A Novel in Verse. By Brad Leithauser. (Knopf, $25.) A 5,700-line verse novel (10-line stanzas, irregularly rhymed) that invokes the ''butterfly effect'' of chaos mathematics: a butterfly's random passage starts Russel Darlington on the road to a career in lepidopterology; many years later, a second butterfly lures him to fall from a cliff, crippling him permanently. THE DARTS OF CUPID: And Other Stories. By Edith Templeton. (Pantheon, $23.) The minutely observed social transactions and discriminating aper\u00e7us in these stories by a writer who is now 85 are set in train by a kind of erotic attraction that the clinically minded would not hesitate to call sadomasochism. THE DEAD CIRCUS. By John Kaye. (Atlantic Monthly, $24.) Kaye's propensity for desolation governs this novel of a polluted Hollywood, where Gene Burk, a private investigator, pursues the death of a rockabilly star in a case that eventually leads through Burk's dead sweetheart to a lover of Charles Manson. DECEMBER 6. By Martin Cruz Smith. (Simon & Schuster, $26.) The picaresque hero of Cruz's thriller, an American wheeler-dealer living in Tokyo on the eve of Pearl Harbor, uses his Zelig-like abilities in an effort to thwart Japan's war plans. DESIRABLE DAUGHTERS. By Bharati Mukherjee. (Theia/Hyperion, $24.95.) In this shrewd, intellectual novel, an Americanized Bengali woman in San Francisco is forced to reckon at length with the culture she has cast aside when a man says he is the illegitimate son of her sister in New York. THE DIVE FROM CLAUSEN'S PIER. By Ann Packer. (Knopf, $24.) Many a young person has come to New York for a restart; the narrator of this beguiling first novel, which is much concerned with the particularities of place and conduct, does it after a nitwit move by her fianc\u00e9 in Wisconsin renders him quadriplegic. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE. By Ann Beattie. (Scribner, $24.) Does less of minimalism mean more of something else? Beattie's novel explores at considerable length, in a prose that owes much to the language of therapy, a fraught relationship between a 40-ish woman whose husband is dead and her brother, a flagrant womanizer. THE EMPEROR OF OCEAN PARK. By Stephen L. Carter. (Knopf, $26.95.) This debut novel by a Yale legal scholar centers on a dynastic black family, whose patriarch, forced to withdraw from consideration for the Supreme Court, has died (and, it appears, also lived) amid mysterious circumstances and rattling skeletons. ENEMY WOMEN. By Paulette Jiles. (Morrow, $24.95.) Love crosses the lines in this Civil War novel set in dubious Missouri, where an 18-year-old spitfire of rebel attachments is the prisoner of a Union officer whose interrogation of her turns into a prison romance. EVA'S COUSIN. By Sibylle Knauss. (Ballantine, $24.95.) A German novel based on facts about a cousin of Hitler's mistress, Eva Braun; Marlene, the protagonist and narrator, is called to keep Eva company in the fateful summer of 1944, and is soon observing the war's end from a lonely, weirdly endangered position. EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED. By Jonathan Safran Foer. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) Alex, a Ukrainian lad whose love for everything American has infected his speech with an amazing thesaurus of near-miss English, narrates this novel about himself and Jonathan Safran Foer, who is visiting ancestral territory and working on a novel about a Ukrainian town where dozens of worthy themes usefully congregate. FAIR WARNING. By Robert Olen Butler. (Atlantic Monthly, $24.) This witty, airy novel fuses comedy of manners and of philosophy, realized in the life of a fine-arts auctioneer whose presentations, orgasmic necessities for her, are sheer performance, aimed at the cupidity and insecurity of her audiences. FAMILY MATTERS. By Rohinton Mistry. (Knopf, $26.) Somebody has to care for a dying Parsi patriarch in Mistry's third novel, but the man's descendants are not up to it; maybe, the book suggests, family isn't what it used to be. The same seems true of Bombay, where this goes on against a background of social decay. FEMALE TROUBLE: A Collection of Short Stories. By Antonya Nelson. (Scribner, $24.) Nelson's fourth collection, written in clear, muscular prose that endures depression, deals chiefly with distraught women in the act of returning somewhere, often to a childhood home, looking for a second chance. FINGERSMITH. By Sarah Waters. (Riverhead, $25.95.) A fine Gothic ear is part of Waters's kit in this neo-Dickensian tale of a baby farmer and a foundling who is drawn into a fearful sexual intimacy as part of a scheme to defraud an heiress. FRAGRANT HARBOR. By John Lanchester. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $25.95.) A novel of large scope, placed chiefly in Hong Kong in 1935 and after, undertaking big propositions: race, class, love, war and, perhaps most successfully, the transformation of a refugee community into one of the world's richest societies. THE GOOD REMAINS. By Nani Power. (Grove, $24.) A fictional elegy for Ashland, Va., where a large cast of characters, brimming with life and goofiness, approaches the Christmas holiday; the central character, a baby doctor who dreams of ham and of the good old days, fails at actually cooking a ham. GOULD'S BOOK OF FISH: A Novel in Twelve Fish. By Richard Flanagan. (Grove, $27.50.) Phantasmagoric energy propels this novel of Tasmanian wonders and horrors whose hero is based on an English convict, the author of a book on the local fish, who died trying to escape from a penal colony in 1831; the original Gould's illustrations appear. GREAT DREAM OF HEAVEN: Stories. By Sam Shepard. (Knopf, $20.) Shepard's heaven is comfortably earthbound and can amount to no more than a painless life, as it does in this collection's title story about two old men whose daily pleasure it is to put on their Stetsons and walk to lunch at a Denny's somewhere near the Mojave. HALF IN LOVE: Stories. By Maile Meloy. (Scribner, $23.) Fourteen stories, set mostly in the author's native Montana, among small-time racetracks and failed oil wells, where brides choose wedding dresses to hide branding-iron scars; no one expects an easy life here, and even the young feel their choices constrained by economics and losing habits. HAZMAT: Poems. By J. D. McClatchy. (Knopf, $23.) Another collection by a poet who carries forward the strict, literate, exact tradition of Auden and James Merrill, but with a physical focus on bodily organs and products that preserves his fluency, exotic settings and intricate forms from aestheticism. THE HEART OF REDNESS. By Zakes Mda. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) A novel encompassing a black South African's critique of the cult of the new, presented as the combat between the forces of ''progress'' and those of tradition, all reflected from a defining religious schism in the Xhosa nation back in 1856-57. THE HORNED MAN. By James Lasdun. (Norton, $24.95.) A psychological thriller that explores the interior motions of self-policing; the narrator, a dedicated member of his college's sexual harassment committee, finds that sexual desire has become bureaucratic maneuvering and dreads the escape of his thought-crimes into real-life action. THE HOUSE OF BLUE MANGOES. By David Davidar. (HarperCollins, $26.95.) A polished first novel by the C.E.O. of Penguin India, the book tracks three generations of the Dorais, a Christian family from the south of India, across the first half of the 20th century, ending just before independence. HOUSE OF WOMEN. By Lynn Freed. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) Fairy-tale elements prevail in this novel in which a mother and a daughter fight to the death; Nalia, an opera singer and Holocaust survivor, reigns over Thea, who is quasi-abducted by a Bluebeardish Syrian in a narrative full of dream logic, psychoanalysis and the writing of journals for others to read. THE IDEA OF PERFECTION. By Kate Grenville. (Viking, $24.95.) Two forlorn, wearied souls -- a shy engineer who fears heights and a rough, gruff textile artist and curator with three husbands behind her -- are exposed to each other in a small town in Australia, a burg so countrified they have only themselves to relate to. I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT: The Life of Kate Reddy, Working Mother. By Allison Pearson. (Knopf, $23.) The beleaguered heroine of this novel, a 35-year-old hedge fund manager in London, struggles madly with the world she has made, containing children, husband, work and worry, under high pressure. IGNORANCE. By Milan Kundera. (HarperCollins, $23.95.) Variations on some of the author's usual themes -- betrayal and lost love, memory and forgetting, exile and return -- in a novel whose heroine returns to Prague after 20 years to find that her old friends have no use for her \u00e9migr\u00e9 life and no longer talk of victimization but of bourgeois success. I'LL TAKE YOU THERE. By Joyce Carol Oates. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $25.95.) The nameless narrator of this daring novel (Oates's 38th) is a philosophy student out to disown her dysfunctional past by affixing herself to others and adopting their identities: first a group of sorority sisters and later a gifted black graduate student. INTERESTING WOMEN: Stories. By Andrea Lee. (Random House, $22.95.) A lush collection of beautifully textured fiction, set mostly in Italy, where the author lives, and featuring American expatriate beauties, many of them black, in situations that are concerned with multiple ways of being foreign -- even in your own home, country or marriage. IN THE FOREST. By Edna O'Brien. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) Though not wholly lacking in the adulterous impulse so fundamental to the characters in O'Brien's powerful evocations of Irish reality in the past, the principals in this novel are concerned with murder, madness and innocence in the backwoods of their island. IN THE HAND OF DANTE. By Nick Tosches. (Little, Brown, $24.95.) A novel in which Tosches first characterizes Dante as a good guy and great poet, then turns to the 21st century and a band of New York mobsters who have stolen the original manuscript of ''The Divine Comedy''; they call upon a character named Tosches to authenticate the document. JULY, JULY. By Tim O'Brien. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) A 30th-anniversary reunion (belated) of the college class of 1969 draws together enough baby boomers in O'Brien's novel to account for the tumultuous sweep of history since their graduation. JUST LIKE BEAUTY. By Lisa Lerner. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) A captivating first novel that takes a surreal look at the buildup to a beauty pageant and a 14-year-old narrator's struggle to break free of its spell. THE KEEPERS OF TRUTH. By Michael Collins. (Scribner, paper, $13.) A sharp, wry novel on the pitfalls and pleasures of American society, featuring a down-to-earth narrator from a seen-better-days city, and a mysterious disappearance; a finalist for Britain's Booker Prize in 2000. THE LAST DREAM-O-RAMA: The Cars Detroit Forgot to Build, 1950-1960. By Bruce McCall. (Crown, $25.) A clever assortment of dream-car caricatures (a family car with a retractable patio, a Vegastar with a slot-machine gearshift, for example) forms this satirical glimpse at 1950's style, marked, in McCall's opinion, by ''fatuousness, bad taste and shameless excess.'' THE LAYING ON OF HANDS: Stories. By Alan Bennett. (Picador USA, $15.) Formerly known as one-quarter of the British comedy group Beyond the Fringe, Bennett serves up a volume of just three stories, all tender, caustic gems about lonely people, most in professions at once earnest and comic (podiatrists, masseurs, vicars). LIFE OF PI. By Yann Martel. (Harcourt, $25.) A high-seas adventure tale with a large dose of allegory, in which Pi Patel, a teenage Indian boy, and a 450-pound tiger named Richard Parker become the only survivors of a shipwreck that swallowed a private zoo belonging to Pi's family. LIMBO, AND OTHER PLACES I HAVE LIVED: Stories. By Lily Tuck. (HarperCollins, $22.95.) There is a distance at the heart of Tuck's collection of short stories about women searching for themselves: a woman fears becoming unrecognizable to her own family, husbands and wives drift apart in their intimacy. Exotic locations underscore the unity of Tuck's tone. THE LITTLE FRIEND. By Donna Tartt. (Knopf, $26.) This lush novel about a Mississippi family at the end of a long decline into middle-class normalcy opens with a grisly murder -- a 9-year-old boy found hanging from a tupelo tree on Mother's Day -- and follows a strong-willed young heroine's crusade to seek out the people who killed her brother. THE LOST GARDEN. By Helen Humphreys. (Norton, $23.95.) In this author's third novel, an awkward horticultural researcher of 35 leaves a blitzed London for the country to organize young women to grow food; there she expands horizontally in new acquaintances and vertically in some symbolically attractive gardens planted before 1914. THE LOVELY BONES. By Alice Sebold. (Little, Brown, $21.95.) An accomplished first novel chronicling the aftermath of a girl's abduction and murder -- narrated by the victim, 14-year-old Susie Salmon; the bones that give the book its title belong not to Susie but to the inspiring connections that are forged after her death. MALAISE. By Nancy Lemann. (Scribner, $24.) The author's fourth novel concerns the transplantation of Fleming Ford, a Southern woman, and her two small children into a California city where, for a while, old complaints about vapidity and sloth seem bright and new; but what's really at stake for Fleming is honoring her commitments and keeping her promises. Refreshing. MARY GEORGE OF ALLNORTHOVER. By Lavinia Greenlaw. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A finely constructed first novel that unveils another eccentric from rural England: Mary George, a socially clumsy yet plucky teenage dreamer who overcomes obstacles (many of which she is oblivious of) by ignoring them. THE METAL SHREDDERS. By Nancy Zafris. (BlueHen/Penguin Putnam, $24.95.) An entertaining, illuminating novel whose lead characters, a third-generation scrap dealer and his Wellesley graduate sister, struggle to run a business they do not love while observed by a father who shows no sign of loving them. ME TIMES THREE. By Alex Witchel. (Knopf, $22.) A funny, if episodic, first novel, about the coming of age in the late 1980's of a 26-year-old fashion editor, her lovable but dense fianc\u00e9, who is engaged to two other girls besides, and her best friend, a gay man with AIDS; by a style writer for The Times. MIND CATCHER. By John Darnton. (Dutton, $25.95.) A cybernetic-anthropological thriller by the cultural news editor of The Times, in which two hubristic scientists attempt to connect a 13-year-old boy to a computer, thus combining human intelligence and computer speed. THE MIRACLE. By John L'Heureux. (Atlantic Monthly, $24.) A thoughtful novel in which a popular young Roman Catholic priest, transferred to the sticks for being too mod, sees a mother's prayer raise her daughter from the dead; in this he eventually sees the ancient truth that love can restore, renew and revive. THE MONK DOWNSTAIRS. By Tim Farrington. (HarperSanFrancisco, $22.95.) A tender, witty novel in which a former monk, after 20 years in his order, rents an apartment from a 38-year-old single mother; the ensuing relationship proceeds cautiously, taking account of the prudence required of struggling people who aren't going to get that many more chances. MORAL HAZARD. By Kate Jennings. (Fourth Estate, $21.95.) A business novel whose modest pace and poetic structure distinguish it from the traditional macho product, packed with hard fact and action; Jennings's purpose is ethical investigation and meditation on the ''perilous, jerry-built'' global financial markets. A MULTITUDE OF SINS: Stories. By Richard Ford. (Knopf, $25.) Quite a few wrongs are done in these elegantly worded stories, although what prevails is generally adultery, often at the end of an affair or later, when it's too late to throw those dice again. The Navigator of New York. By Wayne Johnston. (Doubleday, $27.95.) A bold novel centered on the competition between Robert E. Peary and Dr. Frederick A. Cook to be recognized as first man at the North Pole; to real life Johnston adds the fictional Devlin Stead, through whom we sense the engrossing white waste of the polar North and the flaws of its would-be heroes. THE NERVE. By Glyn Maxwell. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) A collection of largely low-key poems by an intelligent, sensitive writer, moving confidently toward expressions of common feeling in a voice conversational or false-na\u00efve, always sounding within earshot of the English lyric tradition. NEW AND COLLECTED POEMS: 1931-2001. By Czeslaw Milosz. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $45.) In the winter of his 70-year career, Milosz appears to be locked in insoluble argument with himself: where he once credited poetry with the power to rescue mankind from the void, he now demurs, maintaining that language is inadequate to the task of capturing verity. NINE HORSES: Poems. By Billy Collins. (Random House, $21.95.) The current national poet laureate, who produced these verses, is often able to proceed unburdened by many of the tools -- assonance, alliteration, wordplay, complex metrics -- that hang from the poet's belt; he makes his way in the world by being funny. NOBLE NORFLEET. By Reynolds Price. (Scribner, $26.) What distinguishes the hero and title character of Price's novel is a sordid familiarity with death (his younger siblings were killed in their sleep by their mother) and sex (one proclivity in particular drives away the women willing to love him). NO SAINTS OR ANGELS. By Ivan Klima. (Grove, $24.) The personal and the political are inseparable in Klima's newest novel, in which a Prague dentist, daughter of a zealous bureaucrat of the former regime, determines that the hate mail she has been receiving originates with a half brother previously unknown to her. NOTHING THAT MEETS THE EYE: The Uncollected Stories of Patricia Highsmith. By Patricia Highsmith. (Norton, $27.95.) A collection of 28 of Highsmith's previously unanthologized suspense stories, written mostly in the late 1940's and early 50's. NO WAY TO TREAT A FIRST LADY. By Christopher Buckley. (Random House, $24.95.) Buckley's sendup of political sex scandals in the age of constant media takes the form of a legal thriller; accused of assassinating her wayward husband, the first lady denies having done it, but whatever she did is secondary to the heroic proportions of the trial that ensues. OXYGEN. By Andrew Miller. (Harcourt, $24.) In this unusually artful novel, the author, who never really hides his presence, combines two stories that are long and curious in their discovery of each other: one about an Englishwoman with a terminal cancer and her two sons, and another concerning a gay Hungarian playwright who is burdened by regret for his actions during the revolution of 1956. PALLADIO. By Jonathan Dee. (Doubleday, $24.95.) Dee, a courageous novelist of ideas, takes on morals, lost love and the art of selling in this story about a beautiful (and passive) woman and two advertising executives who differ about the power of the viewer over the thing viewed. PARADISE ALLEY. By Kevin Baker. (HarperCollins, $26.95.) A scary, convincing novel steeped in historical fact and set in the New York City of July 1863, when 119 died in three days of rioting against the draft, chiefly by Irish immigrants who feared losing their jobs to the slaves they were being called on to free. THE PIANO TUNER. By Daniel Mason. (Knopf, $24.) A first novel whose alert, responsive, confused, generous hero is a London piano tuner, selected by the War Office in 1886 to trek into the backest beyond of Burma to service the piano of a (possibly mad) British surgeon and proconsul. THE PICKUP. By Nadine Gordimer. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) A chance meeting between a rich, white, South African woman and an immigrant from a Muslim country turns into a love affair that suggests two cultures in quest of each other and the uses of mutual incomprehension for mutual attraction. POEMS SEVEN: New and Complete Poetry. By Alan Dugan. (Seven Stories, $35.) A big volume by a major poet (it won a National Book Award last year) whose life work is adult matter, full of conviction, void of poses; its great theme is human pettiness exposed yet dignified by mortality. POLAR. By T. R. Pearson. (Viking, $24.95.) A quietly unsettling, darkly satirical Southern novel, whose hero, an old rural Virginia reprobate, inexplicably acquires oracular familiarity with the Antarctic and knowledge about a little girl's unsolved disappearance. PRAGUE. By Arthur Phillips. (Random House, $24.95.) A first novel set in 1990, far beyond the recently fallen Berlin Wall, where young Americans reveal themselves not as travelers but mere tourists, detached from their surroundings, weightless and immaterial among time-battered buildings and people who have survived wars and uprisings. RAPTURE. By Susan Minot. (Knopf, $18.) The action of this brief novel is a single act of oral sex, but its life is found in memories of a doomed affair and the thoughts of Kay and Benjamin, its partners; they know each other well, but not what is happening between them. THE REAL McCOY. By Darin Strauss. (Dutton, $24.95.) An ambitious, thought-infested novel placed at the turn of the last century, in which a boxer who is also a confidence man helps America round the corner to a new world of mass communications, celebrity, product endorsement and the makeover. THE RETURN OF THE CARAVELS. By Ant\u00f3nio Lobo Antunes. (Grove, $24.) Portugal's history as an imperial power literally comes home in this novel of collective memory set in 1974; Vasco da Gama, Cabral and Francis Xavier are back in Lisbon, raising hell and anchoring their puny vessels alongside tankers. REVERSIBLE ERRORS. By Scott Turow. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $28.) Kindle County surges to life again in Turow's richly characterized thriller, which revolves around a reluctant pro bono lawyer's efforts to overturn a black man's murder conviction, despite his confession, and free him from death row. THE ROTTERS' CLUB. By Jonathan Coe. (Knopf, $24.95.) A fictional British panorama of the early stages of the transformation wrought on Britain by Margaret Thatcher (another volume is to come); its central figures, not quite finished, are chiefly university-bound students at a school in Birmingham. THE RUSSIAN DEBUTANTE'S HANDBOOK. By Gary Shteyngart. (Riverhead, $24.95.) An energetic, ambitious first novel whose protagonist, a Russian-born graduate of an American college, tries to figure out what it means to be an American, a Russian, an immigrant, a Jew; a great deal of splendid comedy hangs on his inability to find out. THE SEAL WIFE. By Kathryn Harrison. (Random House, $23.95.)

A solid, subtle, ingenious contributor to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, Madison seemed ineffectual after his election to the top magistracy in 1808; Wills attributes his failings to provincialism, na\u00efvet\u00e9 and a preference for the arts of legislation over the drive of leadership.

THE LAST AMERICAN MAN. By Elizabeth Gilbert. (Viking, $24.95.)

LONDON: The Biography. By Peter Ackroyd. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $45.) A prodigiously researched history that is neither top-down nor bottom-up but cross-sectional: shunning traditional chronology and players (aristocrats are scarce), Ackroyd instead offers a London defined by a set of recurring motifs -- smell, sound, speech, fog, fire, ghosts and plague are some of the more significant.

HELL TO PAY. By George P. Pelecanos. (Little, Brown, $24.95.) This down-and-dirty writer from the urban badlands of Washington breaks out two of his best characters, ex-cops Derek Strange and Terry Quinn, to give us a jolting view of lawless neighborhoods where menacing pimps, feral street kids and no-hope stiffs live and prey on one another. JOLIE BLON'S BOUNCE. By James Lee Burke. (Simon & Schuster, $25.) A former plantation overseer, whose biblical name of Legion suggests this diabolical villain's capacity for evil, gets a little too close to Burke's Cajun detective, Dave Robicheaux, in a Southern Gothic tale that uncovers the traditions of sexual sadism in a Louisiana bayou town. THE LAST KASHMIRI ROSE. By Barbara Cleverly. (Carroll & Graf, $24.) The seductive beauty and secret dangers of India under the British Raj are evoked in this exotic debut whodunit, which sends a dashing Metropolitan Police officer to Bengal in 1922 to investigate the deaths of five cavalry officers' wives, each a victim of her own worst nightmare. THE PRONE GUNMAN. By Jean-Patrick Manchette. (City Lights Noir, paper, $11.95.) Cool, compact and shockingly original, this noir crime novel dispassionately observes the professional ruin and mental decline of a hired killer who makes the mistake of thinking that he can retire from his deadly trade and settle down with a nice girl. Q IS FOR QUARRY. By Sue Grafton. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $26.95.) Building on the skimpy facts in a true (and still unsolved) 1969 homicide of an unknown woman whose body was dumped in a quarry in Santa Barbara County, Grafton creates a sensitive assignment for her private eye, Kinsey Millhone, and two old geezer-cops who are obsessed with this sad case. RESOLUTION. By Denise Mina. (Carroll & Graf, $25.) Although it can stand alone as the stark account of the murder of an eccentric old woman who sells bootleg CD's at an open-air flea market, this crime novel is the final chapter in a class-conscious trilogy about the disintegration of a socially dysfunctional neighborhood in gritty Glasgow. THE SNIPER'S WIFE. By Archer Mayor. (Mysterious/Warner, $23.95.) Willy Kunkle, a one-armed, wild-eyed cop who normally works the clean mean streets of Brattleboro, Vt., comes to New York to identify the body of his ex-wife and sticks around to hunt for her killer, using the sniper skills he picked up in Vietnam to feel his way around this jungle of a city. THE STONE MONKEY. By Jeffery Deaver. (Simon & Schuster, $25.) In a labyrinthine plot that is a marvel of intricate game construction, Deaver pits his genius sleuth, Lincoln Rhyme, against a shape-shifting villain known as the Ghost, who sank a ship of illegal Chinese immigrants off the coast of Long Island and is now hellbent on eliminating all witnesses to the atrocity. SCIENCE FICTION ACROSS THE NIGHTINGALE FLOOR. By Lian Hearn. (Riverhead, $24.95.) An engaging fantasy of love and revenge that secures the reader's suspension of disbelief by bringing to life an appealing setting -- an alternate medieval Japan -- and a likable young hero who has inherited the ability to cloud men's minds and to seem to be in two places at the same time. APPLESEED. By John Clute. (Tor/ Tom Doherty, $25.95.) The co-author of both The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and The Encyclopedia of Fantasy brings his vast knowledge of imaginative literature to this playful but daunting far-future novel. Readers must be on their toes to follow Clute's quicksilver re-envisioning of familiar genre premises and jargon. THE LONGEST WAY HOME. By Robert Silverberg. (Eos/HarperCollins, $25.95.) In his usual lucid prose Silverberg chronicles the long journey home of a young aristocrat who, fleeing a rebellion of his world's supposedly docile underclass, discovers some disturbing truths about his society and some heartening truths about himself, while interacting with a fascinating mix of truly surprisingly alien aliens. PRETERNATURAL3. By Margaret Wander Bonanno. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $24.95.) Bonanno is at it again, proving (as she did in the first two books in this series) that science fiction and postmodern metafiction were made for each other. What she sees while looking over her own shoulder -- love outdueling death -- will enthrall any reader prepared to follow her through this tricky maze of a novel. SKIN FOLK. By Nalo Hopkinson. (Warner Aspect, paper, $12.95.) The acclaimed author of ''Brown Girl in the Ring'' and ''Midnight Robber'' puts her lyrical gifts to good use in a collection of new and previously published short stories whose mood ranges from erotic to enraged. SOLITAIRE. By Kelley Eskridge. (Eos/HarperCollins, $24.95.) The plotting of this first novel may strain credulity, but when a young woman who has been promised the world is sentenced to eight years of solitary confinement inside her own head, her high-tech ordeal is evoked in a stylistic and psychological tour de force that arouses both pity and terror. THE WATCH. By Dennis Danvers. (Eos/HarperCollins, $24.95.) A thoughtful time-travel romp by the author of ''Circuit of Heaven'' and ''End of Days.'' Its unlikely hero is the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, who is plucked from his deathbed in 1921 and given a second chance to bring Western society to its senses. THE YEARS OF RICE AND SALT. By Kim Stanley Robinson. (Bantam, $25.95.) What if the Black Plague had wiped out not a third but virtually all of Europe's population in the 14th century? This is the eye-opening premise of Robinson's latest novel, a magisterial alternate history from one of science fiction's most important writers.", "headline": {"main": "Notable Books"}, "abstract": "List of notable books of 2002 with brief descriptions; drawings (L)", "print_page": "60", "word_count": 16536, "_id": "4fd223358eb7c8105d7a8a19", "snippet": "This list has been selected from books reviewed since the Holiday Books issue of December 2001.
