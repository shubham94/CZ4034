Coronary death rates dropped among both groups that took part in the study. However, one subgroup that received special treatment for high blood pressure actually suffered a higher death rate than those receiving usual medical care, raising serious questions about the safety of blood-pressure drugs for such patients. The 10-year, $115 million study was conducted at 22 medical centers in the United States and Canada among men who were considered to be in the top 10 percent of coronary risk because of their high blood pressure, high serum cholesterol or smoking habits.", "headline": {"main": "HEART DISEASE STUDY SHOWS NO GAIN IN BID TO CUT RISKS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "word_count": 884, "_id": "4fd129068eb7c8105d5f019e", "snippet": "Leaders of the largest study ever done on the value of trying to diminish the major risks associated with heart disease said today they had found no significant difference in deaths between a group that received special medical treatment and one that...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/17/us/heart-disease-study-shows-no-gain-in-bid-to-cut-risks.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEATH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Jane", "middlename": "E.", "lastname": "BRODY", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By JANE E.
