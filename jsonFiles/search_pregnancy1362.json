So primary and forceful have been this novel's appeal and effects upon two generations of us that to not already know Richard Yates's great book seems incongruous, and handing it over cold feels clumsy, a bit like introducing a sage old friend to a precocious new friend: we almost would rather not, for all the crucial things that cannot be thought and said again. And yet of course we must, since great books, like great friends, are to be shared. Suffice it to say that among readers of American fiction since the beginning of the 1960's, ''Revolutionary Road,'' published to acclaim in 1961, has become a kind of cultish standard. And this is especially true among writers, who have kept its reputation burnished by praising it, teaching it, sometimes unwittingly emulating its apparent effortlessness, its complete accessibility, its luminous particularity, its deep seriousness toward us human beings -- about whom it conjures shocking insights and appraisals. We marvel at its consummate writerliness, its almost simple durability as a purely made thing of words that defeats all attempts at classification. Realism, naturalism, social satire -- the standard critical bracketry -- all go begging before this splendid book. ''Revolutionary Road'' is simply ''Revolutionary Road,'' and to invoke it enacts a sort of cultural-literary secret handshake among its devotees.", "headline": {"main": "Essay; American Beauty (Circa 1955)"}, "abstract": "Richard Ford essay pays tribute to 40th year in print of Richard Yates's novel Revolutionary Road; drawing (L)", "print_page": "16", "word_count": 3639, "_id": "4fd221178eb7c8105d7a4ec0", "snippet": "As ''Revolutionary Road'' approaches its 40th year in print, it seems odd to imagine readers opening it for the first time.
