The client, as Nick Newcombe, who was overseeing her home care, had explained, was resisting help and had fired a succession of workers. Newcombe thought the client would feel empowered if she had a choice, and so had arranged for Lorna and two other aides to be interviewed by the woman, her nephew Howard (Buzz) Katzen and his wife.

Then she had barricaded herself in her bathroom while naked and demanded the bread and water that was any prisoner's due.
