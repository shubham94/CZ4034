This humorous approach hasn't worked so well, however. This spring, for example, a study revealed that Philip Morris's ''Think. Don't Smoke.'' ads actually made kids more likely to pick up a cigarette. Now the U.S. government is considering a new approach -- bombarding Americans with a simpler, more aggressive message: smoking is really, really gross. This year, inspired by a successful Canadian experiment, two congressmen introduced a bill in the House of Representatives that would require tobacco manufacturers to display graphic warning labels on all cigarette packs. Under the similar Canadian law, which has been in place for almost two years, the entire top half of every pack must be covered with one of 16 government-approved pictures brandishing the horrors of smoking. Most of the images look like either pulp-novel book jackets (a choking man accompanied by the words ''cigarettes leave you breathless'') or junior-high health textbooks (a close-up on a mouth full of rotted yellow teeth). Other images include a slack-jawed man hooked up to a respirator, a line graph showing the number of deaths from tobacco use and -- in the one example of the always popular smoking-causes-impotence argument -- a limp cigarette.", "snippet": "What's the best way to get people to stop smoking?
