O'Neill Jr., the Speaker of the House of Representatives, has reportedly reached a compromise with the White House on the composition of a panel that President Reagan has proposed for a bipartisan study of Social Security. According to Congressional sources, the 15-member group that the President suggested in a televised speech last month will be composed of seven Republicans, seven Democrats and an independent, to insure that its recommendations not carry a partisan stamp. When Mr. Reagan made the original suggeston, he said he would name five members to the panel, as would Mr. O'Neill, a Democrat, and Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., the Republican majority leader of the Senate. This led some Democrats to oppose the proposal on the ground that the panel would be composed of 10 Republicans and five Democrats, with the latter powerless to influence the ''bipartisan'' group. ''I think Speaker O'Neill can count better than that,'' observed Jim Wright, the leader of the Democratic majority in the House.", "headline": {"main": "ACCORD IS REPORTED ON SOCIAL SECURITY PANEL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "39", "word_count": 626, "_id": "4fd11f628eb7c8105d5df0b7", "snippet": "Thomas P.
