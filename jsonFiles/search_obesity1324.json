People who approach dining, both at home and in restaurants, with reason and moderation as their guides can expect an improvement in well-being and a decreased risk of developing such diet-related disorders as heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure and obesity. Unfortunately, in far too many cases, reason is supplanted by a fervor that sings the praises of a host of foods of questionable, and sometimes negative, nutritional value. Myths abound in the health food industry and, experts say, many believers are being hoodwinked. Even supermarket shoppers are subject to PERSONAL HEALTHhealth-food hype since major food producers, seeking to cash in on health concerns, now offer many foods with such nutritionally misleading catchwords as ''natural,'' ''no preservatives,'' ''sweetened with honey,'' ''no cholesterol,'' ''no added sugar,'' and the like. And in restaurants, consumers have even less to guide them since menus do not provide a detailed list of ingredients. As a result, in their desire to improve their health through better eating, some people are actually endangering it. And they are paying premium prices for the privilege of doing so.", "snippet": "THERE is much good to be said for those who eat such wholesome foods as whole-grain breads and cereals, fresh fruits and vegetables, entrees low in fat and salt, desserts low in sugar and beverages free of caffeine.
