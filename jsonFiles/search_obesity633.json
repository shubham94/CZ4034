Having taught for 35 years, I've witnessed the evolution of school lunches and been at various times dismayed, hopeful, discouraged and optimistic. I've also seen a trend toward better nutrition, moving in baby steps, but moving. No war, and this is a worthwhile one, was ever won easily or quickly. Look how long it took us to allow these disturbing statistics of obesity and poor health to mount. Let's hope Belkin will give us a yearly progress report, with more and more good news. Kathy Adasiak Rochester Belkin describes a problem that began 60 years ago, when Congress passed a school-lunch act that essentially ''put schools in the restaurant business.'' Running a restaurant isn't easy, as I know from experience. Schools will succeed in doing so only when food is acknowledged as central to a school's educational enterprise: when its kitchens are classrooms; its cooks, teachers; its curriculum, eco-gastronomy; and when every child eats at school. For 10 years, our goal at the Edible Schoolyard at Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, in Berkeley, Calif., has been to bring children into a relationship with food that will nourish them in multiple ways their entire lives, through a hands-on education that connects them both to the garden and the beauty of nature and to the pleasures of cooking and traditions of the table. The best part is that children enjoy this so much that the lessons are learned effortlessly. A nutritional upgrade is not enough to change students' eating habits and values. Eco-gastronomy ought to be integrated into every school curriculum from kindergarten on up. Alice Waters Berkeley, Calif. Belkin writes that schools keep trying to improve student health through nutrition education and lunchroom choices, but she points out that ''there is one big shadow over all this healthy enthusiasm: no one can prove that it works.'' This emphasis on the need for data is misplaced. We know that all foods are not equal in nutritional value. What can be wrong with teaching children to consume the right amounts of the most nutritious foods? And if we agree that it makes sense to teach this, isn't there an obligation to put the teaching into practice in the lunchroom? Denise Jacob, R.N. Birmingham, Mich. Your writer makes no mention of portion size in her otherwise thorough article. Perhaps it is not what kids are eating but how much they consume that is fueling this problem. The boy who ate 12 portions of sweet potatoes at one sitting might have been better off with one slice of pizza or a couple of Oreos. When it comes to weight control, there is no substitute for eating less, no matter what is on your plate. Rachel Wyner New York Benjamin Caballero says that ''everything about the world -- fast food, video games, television ads, everything -- conspires to undo even the best things that happen in schools.'' That is because obesity is not just about the food.Yes, healthy lunch choices should be a given in school, but people become and stay obese for far more complex reasons. Those who do not use food as a substance for coping with their lives often do not understand this.
