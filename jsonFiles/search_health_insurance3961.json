Lenz heads one of the largest insurance brokerages in the country. The company specializes in insuring employees of small businesses. Today it insures about 200,000 employers, employees and their families in New York State, almost half of them one and two-person businesses. Born in Coney Island the youngest son of a family of circus entertainers, Mr. Lenz worked odd jobs -- everything from a magician to carnival barker -- to earn enough money to attend Oswego State Teachers College. After graduation and a brief stint as an English teacher at Bellport High School, he entered the insurance business. Mr. Lenz, 60, who has lived in Bellport for more than 40 years, is married and has four children, two of whom work in the business. His daughter Robbin is president and chief officer of operations. His son, Gordon A. Lenz 2d, is vice president of Conference Associates. Q. Why did you create this company? A. Back in the 1970's, very small businesses were not in a position to get well-priced health care. Firms that had 100 employees and 500 employees were able to get enormous discounts and get prices for coverage that were very attractive. Small firms were being disenfranchised. Firms that had under three employees couldn't buy group insurance at all. So in 1973 I decided to put together what was known as a multiple employer trust that enabled me to put together 100 companies covering perhaps 500 people and allow those companies to get the same kind of coverage that a company of 500 people could provide. We passed on the discounts to employers. Q. How much? A. It amounted to 18 percent. Q. Did that discount make a difference in whether some employers provided health care coverage? A. Oh yes, and the coverage that they were able to access was much better than small firms were able to get at the time. Even though the price may have been there, many times the coverage was modified because the exposure for small cases was so much. And as years went on, we were as much as 40 percent below the marketplace for small groups. Q. What did this program mean for the individual employee? A. The average small firm would have had a $500 deductible against its coverage. We were able to give a $100 deductible. Prescription benefits were never available to small companies, we gave it to them. You could never buy dental. We did. Life insurance had to be applied for on a full application. We provided it on a guaranteed issue basis. Q. How popular did this idea become? A. By the mid-80's, we were covering 50,000 to 60,000 people. In 1993 we acquired a company that did something like we did, which increased our coverage to 28,000 individual corporations and 220,000 people, mostly in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. Q. How did President Clinton's health care proposals affect you? A. He suggested to Congress and to the American people that he would like to do the same thing that I had been doing for the last 25 years. The only difference was that he wanted the Government to do it as opposed to private enterprise and full-time licensed, trained insurance people. I didn't think too highly of that. Q. Would the White House plan have saved employers and employees money? A. Perhaps it might have saved a little money, not enough to be concerned about. When I have a trained insurance representative go to see someone who owns a business, he brings to that interview a great deal of training and experience. We presently offer 30 different programs with varying companies that you can buy. I have no particular ax to grind if someone wants to buy from Oxford or Metropolitan or Prudential. People will eventually choose the program that has the best coverage to suit their needs at the lowest price. Q. When the President began speaking about the need for universal coverage, he said there were 37 million uninsured Americans. A. The 37 million included people who were in transition and almost half of them were in transition. Q. Between jobs. A. That's right, which means that although they didn't have coverage at the moment, they would within 18 months and frequently within 6 months. And if you lived on Long Island and lost your job, you could still keep your coverage -- you just had to pay for it. By the way, it's significant to point out that when Senator Daniel Moynihan said on television one Sunday morning, ''What health care crisis?'' it shed a whole new light on the panic that was being instituted by the current regime. There is no health care crisis, nor was there in 1993. Q. Why is 37 million Americans without health care coverage not a crisis? A. Because of the 37 million people, most were children -- and there is a current initiative that would cover them, which I don't have a problem with. You also had some people who are indigent -- they never worked and never will work. If they need health care, I have no problem with the Government trying to find some program -- either in combination with private enterprise or doing it on its own -- to give these people interim health care, certainly emergency care. Q. But isn't it true that most people who have no health care coverage are employed at full-time jobs? A. Yes, that's correct. But they have access to coverage. Let's assume that I'm a 22-year-old, heavily muscled, strapping young man who is not married. My employer comes to me and says the coverage that we have costs $100 a month and I'm willing to pay $50 of it. Most young men that I know certainly can't envision themselves getting sick. They would rather have the extra $12.50 per week in their paycheck and therefore decline coverage. The fact that they don't have health care coverage is not a crisis. They probably don't need it at this point. Q. When do you recommend that people have coverage? A. Always. Q. Payments to hospitals and doctors for procedures are being sharply limited by insurance companies today. A. True. Doctors are definitely making less money and hospitals have excess beds. Q. If doctors and hospitals are making less, what about insurance companies? A. They operate on very tight, small margins. Insurance companies are merging because their margins are so small. The average insurance company works on less than 2 points. And what they do for those 2 points is to run the entire case, to push all the paper. And that's the entire profit that's left in a case after they are done. Q. What was their profit margin before? A. It was closer to 10 in the 70's. All the fat has been cut out. It's very difficult for an insurance agent to make a living today selling only health insurance. It's very difficult for a company to stay ahead. Q. There are those who say that health care coverage is financially out of reach for many people. A. If someone is barely able, because of his income, to make ends meet and then you add on the cost of health care, I would buy that statement. On the other hand, if you have someone who has made the judgment not to have health care coverage and is then presented with a $50,000 bill, he didn't make a very wise decision, did he? Q. How has the health care industry changed since the Clinton Administration's health care initiative? A. The major cry that the community had was that the cost of health care was rising dramatically. There are only two things that made that happen -- hospitals and doctors -- kept on increasing their costs. Then managed care said that an operation was worth this much in this geographic area and it would pay no more than that. If I'm a physician who was charging $10,000 for that procedure and the most I could collect from the insurance company was $5,000, I suddenly started to charge closer to $5,000. Q. I understand that insurance companies will pay different rates, depending upon location. A. There are norms that are established for work being done based on Zip code. Nassau County is now the most expensive place in the United States for health care. It's much more expensive than in New York City. Q. To buy health care? A. And to get health care. The hospitals and the doctors in Nassau County are No. 1 in the world. Suffolk County is much more reasonable, a little less than New York City. Q. Why are hospital and doctor costs so high in Nassau? A. By design.I really can't pursue it, I don't have enough information. But wouldn't it be interesting if you went to a Fifth Avenue doctor and he was two-thirds the price of your doctor on Northern Boulevard? Is one doctor really that much better or worse than the other? If one doctor practices at North Shore and one practices at Columbia-Presbyterian? If the quality and the credentials are the same, why should you be charged more in Nassau County? But that's what's happening. Q. How much more are health care premiums in Nassau County? A. About 7 to 9 percent compared with New York City and 15 percent compared with Suffolk. Q. How has managed care brought down costs? A. The trend in health care has gone from a 30 percent increase in costs per year, which it was in 1986, to below 4 percent. We cleaned up our own act. We didn't need Federal intervention telling us what to do, and we didn't bring an entirely new bureaucracy telling us how to run health care. Q. So, in the end, the health care initiative accomplished some good. A. I think it scared the living daylights out of them, yes. It's hard to get that comment out of me, but it obviously has had a beneficial affect. Q. And what about the Administration's promise of affordable health care coverage for all? A. No one knows if they could have delivered on their promise. And in the 1,300 page diatribe that was prepared by the White House, nowhere was it discussed where they were going to get the money from to make it go.", "headline": {"main": "Insuring Employees of Small Businesses", "kicker": "Long Island Q&A: Gordon A.
