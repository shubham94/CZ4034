Chicken and turkey franks, turkey ham and turkey pastrami have taken their place beside the fattier beef and pork versions, and ground turkey has begun to invade the market for ground beef. But in choosing among protein-rich foods, people often make dietary changes that are no improvement. In some cases, as in substituting cheese for red meat, the changes are more likely to harm than help. Also confusing is the fact that some foods people have been told to eat - for example, veal - actually have more cholesterol than beef. And after years of being told to avoid cholesterol-rich shrimp and fatty fish, suddenly these are said to be O.K., even desirable. With the link between dietary fat and cholesterol and the risk of coronary heart disease ever more firmly established, the American Heart Association has further reduced recommended consumption levels. The new guidelines suggest a maximum of 30 percent of calories from fat, with at most 10 percent from saturated fats, and a daily cholesterol intake of 100 milligrams for each 1,000 calories consumed (to a maximum of 300 milligrams a day).", "snippet": "THE cholesterol-conscious American is eating less red meat, fewer eggs, more poultry and slightly more fish than two decades ago.
