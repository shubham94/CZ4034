The position has a vague mandate -- to ''represent the consumers of city services'' -- and a grab bag of seemingly unrelated responsibilities, from taking over if the mayor resigns to serving as an ex officio member of every City Council committee. The present occupant, Mark Green, turned the job into a platform for this year's mayoral campaign, and his departure has attracted a raft of candidates, some of whom may be hoping to follow in his footsteps. The Democratic primary will choose the next public advocate, since there are no Republican candidates. The leading contenders in the race are two City Council members, Stephen DiBrienza and Kathryn Freed; Betsy Gotbaum, the former parks commissioner; Assemblyman Scott Stringer; and Norman Siegel, the former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. Ms. Freed has been a fine member of the Council, but she does not have the breadth of some of the other candidates. Mr. Siegel would certainly be good at the part of the job that involves holding press conferences and criticizing city officials.
