Both parties have tried hard to project a centrist image while tranquilizing their activists. In Philadelphia, George W. Bush's inclusiveness pitch required keeping the Republican right wing offstage while throwing it a bone or two in the platform. The Democrats in Los Angeles reversed the process, giving the Kennedy-Jackson wing of the party plenty of air time but little consolation in the platform. Nevertheless, it is clear that there are measurable differences between the two candidates on domestic policy, and that on issue after issue the Democrats would still urge a more vigorous deployment of federal resources to solve national problems. These differences may not be enough to satisfy Mr. Nader's aggressively populist inclinations, but if the election were held now, they would give the voters a real choice. The biggest difference, perhaps the defining difference, lies in how the two men would distribute the lion's share of a projected budget surplus of $4.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Mr. Bush, warning that this money should not be hijacked by federal programs, would use about $1.3 trillion to cut taxes, mainly for affluent families. Al Gore would cut taxes by only $500 billion, mostly subsidies of one sort or another for middle-income families. He would also use every penny of the surplus generated by Social Security, about $2.5 trillion, to reduce the national debt. Mr. Bush would use the same money partly to reduce the debt and partly to finance a new system of personal retirement accounts.
