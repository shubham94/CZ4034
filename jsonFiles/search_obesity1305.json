Many of these people jogged, played tennis and watched their weight with never an inkling that their coronary arteries had become progressively clogged and that their hearts were in mortal danger. Now, in what appears to have come as a major surprise to the medical profession, conclusive evidence has been published in the last 18 months that for millions of people one of the body's primary warning systems for heart disease can be defective, slow to turn on or missing. The warning system is a network of nerves encompassing the heart that signals angina pectoris, or chest pain. When blood flow to the heart is reduced for any reason, pain is sometimes - but not always - felt.", "snippet": "EVERY year, 450,000 seemingly healthy Americans drop dead in their tracks from massive heart attacks that strike without warning.

But how much activity, and which activity, is safe for both mother and unborn child? Obstetricians typically advise their patients to continue doing whatever they had been doing prior to pregnancy, perhaps reducing the intensity or duration of an exercise as pregnancy progresses. Such recommendations, however, have been based more on intuition than on solid research. Moreover, they predate the time when millions of young women started pursuing vigorous activities such as jogging, aerobic dancing, tennis and weight lifting.", "snippet": "T HE notion that women should ''take it easy'' for most or all of the nine months of pregnancy is now widely recognized to be a medical myth, and impractical besides.
