Lemelson's recently granted patent for \"apparatus and methods for automated analysis\" set a record in the world of \"submarine\" patents. A submarine patent is one that an applicant keeps submerged for years and sometimes decades at the Patent Office by drawing out the examination process and effectively pre-empting others from patenting the same invention. The advantage to the applicant is that anyone who makes a product based on that invention will owe the inventor licensing fees once the patent is granted.", "snippet": "THE Patent and Trademark Office does not keep official tabs on such statistics, but Gary L.

It causes your blood pressure and heart rate to rabbit around. You lose a day or two of work here and there, and sometimes you need treatment in a hospital emergency room. You are worried, and chances are, if you are a white-collar employee and your symptoms appear at work, your employer, and perhaps even local public health officials, will be too. If you happen to be a tobacco harvester, doing seasonal work, there's a good chance you recognize those symptoms. They are typical of green tobacco sickness, an illness that, as one Kentucky tobacco farmer put it, \"can make you feel like you're going to die.\" Despite evidence that the illness, essentially a form of nicotine poisoning that can affect field workers when wet tobacco touches their skin, is endemic among tobacco pickers, it is widely regarded as a nuisance and a cost of doing business.", "snippet": "YOU have an illness that makes you feel faint, pitch over and pass out or vomit.
