The Clinton Administration is debating measures that might slow the process. But what is really needed, nearly everyone agrees, is a wholesale reorganization of the way Americans work. The reorganization, emphasizing worker training, flexibility and initiative, is hardly new. Some American companies have been trying for years to make the transformation. But now, with the job cutbacks showing no sign of easing off, the need to change is becoming more urgent.

The patient was a Latin American male, age 24, who had been shot in a dispute in Madisonville, 85 miles away, at 1:15 A.M.
