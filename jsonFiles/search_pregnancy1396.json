It's about cultural preservation. That's why there's no swimsuit competition, and contestants spend about as much time in standard pageant-issue evening gowns as it takes to boil an egg. ''If there was a swimsuit competition, I would never enter,'' said 19-year-old Leslie John, one of the dozens of junior princesses and regional Miss Navajos who came last month to watch the five-day pageant in Window Rock, Ariz. ''I could have smelled like sheep, and it would have been fine.'' Indeed, the year before, contenders for the Miss Navajo crown had competed in sheep butchering. ''You need the hooves to hang it up with,'' recalled Floranda Dempsey, the only one of this year's four contestants who competed last year. ''But we cut their whole hooves off. We made a huge mess.'' She laughed. ''It was a female. We cut into the breast. Milk everywhere!'' Instead, the women, outfitted most of the time in moccasins and crushed velvet dresses or tunics that resemble Navajo rugs, with their hair pulled back, had to explain the background of the Treaty of 1868 -- in Navajo. And card wool. And spin it. And demonstrate rug weaving. (Some of the modern contests involved demonstrating CPR, reciting Natalie Merchant lyrics in poetic form and doing aerobics.) They seemed to have the hardest time when they each built a fire, heaped shortening in pans and prepared fry bread -- a traditional food that resembles a Frisbee-size sopaipilla. Karletta Chief, a Ph.D. candidate in environmental engineering and science at Stanford and the daughter of a Baptist preacher, stared angrily at the frying pan resting on her fire. A judge had asked her, in Navajo, about lighting the fire, and she had answered using the word ''liver'' when she meant to say ''bark.'' Valerie Jones, who has a degree in social work from Northern Arizona University, struggled to keep her fire going and looked sad. She had said ''lightning'' instead of ''match.'' (''Those elderly lady judges,'' she noted afterward, ''they really scare us. Because we respect them so much.'') Dempsey, whose spoken Navajo has improved significantly since a medicine man addressed the problem with a ceremony for her, encountered a different problem: she usually uses powdered milk in her recipe, but the pageant hadn't provided any.", "headline": {"main": "The Way We Live Now: 10-08-00: Phenomenon; Crowning Miss Navajo"}, "abstract": "Article on annual Miss Navajo Pageant in Window Rock, Ariz, where contestants compete in cultural skills such as carding and spinning wool, rug weaving, building fires and preparing fry bread and more modern pursuits such as CPR and aerobics; photo (M)", "print_page": "32", "word_count": 873, "_id": "4fd21a668eb7c8105d798bd1", "snippet": "The Miss Navajo Pageant isn't about sex.
