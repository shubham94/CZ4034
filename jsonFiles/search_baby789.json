Thousands attended and representatives of one organization after another spoke about the difference the pastor had made. Mr. Forsman's church had celebrated every Easter Eve with a jazz vigil, and so, appropriately, he was honored with a Dixieland send-off himself. At graveside, a sole trumpeter played ''Just a Closer Walk With Thee.''
