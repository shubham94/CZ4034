They were asked to place themselves in his shoes and imagine whether he felt, in his drug-induced fury, that his acts were ''reasonable.'' The verdict they rendered yesterday hinted, in a sense, that their answer to the question was yes. By convicting Mr. Thomas of manslaughter rather than murder, the nine men and three women hearing his case were in no way condoning his murderous rampage, which left 10 dead in a Brooklyn apartment. The manslaughter conviction still carries a penalty of 25 to 50 years' imprisonment. It suggested, however, that in the tortured universe he lived in, Mr. Thomas's behavior was, in a peculiar sense, reasonable.", "headline": {"main": "GRAY AREA OF THE LAW"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "27", "word_count": 937, "_id": "4fd1430e8eb7c8105d61c045", "snippet": "The 12 jurors passing on the fate of Christopher Thomas had to do more than weigh the evidence against him.

An area the size of the United States within Africa is rendered unpopulated by cattle because of the prevalence of the trypanosome parasite that causes trypanosomiasis, or African sleeping sickness. Also, many of the thousands of cases that develop among humans each year have become resistant to the standard drugs used to treat the disease, thus allowing the corkscrew-shaped parasite to continue its invasion of the brain to cause a lethal encephalitis that gives the disease its popular name. The precise number of cases of the disease is not known because of the lack of accurate reporting systems.
