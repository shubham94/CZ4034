One day the child simply stopped kicking. At the hospital, she said, the staff ''wouldn't look me in the eye, they acted as if it was just another medical procedure.'' After labor was induced and the baby was stillborn, Mrs. Lieberman went home and cried for weeks, thinking she must be crazy because she so deeply missed a child she had never known. Last spring, Mrs. Lieberman had a miscarriage, this time in her third month. By then she and her husband, Thomas, had two healthy children, but they were not the only reason, she said, that her second loss was less devastating than her first.", "headline": {"main": "SUPPORT GROUPS WHEN PREGNANCY FAILS Sources of Aid SHARE is a clearinghouse for support groups for couples who have suffered miscarriage or stillbirth.
