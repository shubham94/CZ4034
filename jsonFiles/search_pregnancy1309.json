Directed by Luke Greenfield (PG-13, 83 minutes). The goofy new Rob Schneider comedy isn't the gross-out farce that its title suggests. The star portrays a meek, much-persecuted police department file clerk who, after being implanted with animal organs after a near-fatal car accident, fights against the instincts of the donor beasts that rise up inside him. Especially when he goes into a mating dance with a female goat and feeds a bird (bird style) in an animal shelter, this fable about the dog beneath the skin is very funny.
