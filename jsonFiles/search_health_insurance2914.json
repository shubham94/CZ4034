National health care costs in 1970 had just surpassed $70 billion, less than three times Kaiser's total budget today. After two years, I left Kaiser because it lacked the wellness focus I desired. Kaiser's member population is aging and unless they focus on wellness their per-member costs will skyrocket even more than they have in the past. Their per-member per-year income is $3,085 based on the numbers presented in the article. That's great compared to the rest of the country, but they could do much better by spending $3 billion on prevention rather than on a computerized management program that like others in the past will be thrown away in four or five years.
