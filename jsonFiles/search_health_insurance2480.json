And now he has a great new music video, for ''All Time Love.'' The veteran director known as W.I.Z. cast Mr. Young as a subversive in a fascist state; the video unfolds at the world's most elegant show trial, with our hero gazing, brave but despondent, at the woman who betrayed him. (Watch it at will-youngonline.com/cinema/.) It's a simple ballad, well sung: a bit of piano, a lot of falsetto. The courtroom proceedings and resistance meetings are beautifully shot, but even better is an odd, inspired scene near the end: the stern, corrupt judges lead a procession down the hallway. They're protected by armed guards, and they're devouring ice cream cones. Da Muzicianz It seems likely that supply preceded demand: manufacturers started putting cameras in cellphones mainly because they could. Slowly, we realized the implications. No good or bad deed would ever go unphotographed again. Embarrassing images would spread even quicker than word-of-mouth. And eventually, a hip-hop group like Da Muzicianz (a Ying Yang Twins side project) would record a song like ''Camera Phone'' (TVT), encouraging photogenic revelers everywhere to ''Shake sum'n for the camera phone.'' At least these posers can't say they weren't warned. Three 6 Mafia With the music video for ''Poppin' My Collar,'' this great Memphis hip-hop group proves yet again that it's almost always a great idea to put little kids in rap videos. Kids make rappers seem both more immature and more grown-up; there's a pleasing implication that even hip-hop's hardest take a kindly interest in America's youth. In the ''Poppin' My Collar'' video, three children arrive, selling $5 candy bars. Apparently, when he's not composing eerie synthesizer beats or roaring wild-eyed rhymes, Juicy J is a pretty soft touch: he buys the lot, nostalgic for his own childhood. Soon the rappers have been replaced by their former selves: four exuberant kids in an S.U.V., lip-synching the swaggering lyrics. LMC and Rachel McFarlane Once you hear it, it makes perfect sense. A thumping beat from the production team LMC, complete with a gluey bass line that evokes Daft Punk. Brassy, gospel-inspired singing from Ms. McFarlane. And a chorus that comes straight from ''You Get What You Give,'' the 1998 New Radicals song that became a cult hit. The result, available at aatw.com/artist.php?id=148, is a euphoric (if perhaps somewhat mercenary) club favorite, based on a song that nearly everyone has heard, even if not everyone can identify it immediately. The only drawback: the famously petulant verses are sadly missed. Surely it's possible to find a danceable arrangement for the couplet ''Health-insurance ripoff lying/ F.D.A., big bankers buying.'' Cat Power Another well-known Three 6 Mafia video showed the members drinking cough syrup out of baby bottles. In tribute (one imagines), a black man holds a baby bottle in the first scene of the video for ''Living Proof,'' the current single from Cat Power. (Visit matadorrecords.com to watch it.) The video was made by Harmony Korine, a white director who been playing with race for years. Chan Marshall, the white woman who records as Cat Power, looks pretty fetching in a pink hooded sweatshirt emblazoned with the face of Tupac Shakur. Soon she strips to a red catsuit and picks up a huge white cross, competing in a footrace against women in Muslim veils. Despite the cross (or because of it?) she finishes second; the three medalists take the podium and give a black-power salute. Like much of Mr. Korine's work, this video is provocative and vague, like an offensive dream you can't quite interpret, or shake. And throughout, there's Ms. Marshall's luminous music: a ghostly soul song, even more unshakable. Ryoji Ikeda For his intoxicating new CD, ''Dataplex'' (Raster-Noton, available from forcedexposure.com), this rigorous Japanese producer created a mutating series of electronic compositions. The third piece, ''data.duplex,'' sounds like the byproduct of some computational process: a faint hum, a few beeps, some ultra-trebly, flickering tones. By the time you get to the 15th piece, ''data.reflex,'' the rhythms are much more decipherable. There's a regular pulse, a propulsive syncopation; it's dance music, nearly. The 20th and final track, ''data.adaplex,'' is maximalist, in a sense. It contains ''specific waveform data'' that may disrupt your listening experience by triggering ''playback errors.'' No joke. At least one listener will never again hear this CD without thinking about a computer that had to be rebooted and a column that had to be partly rewritten.", "headline": {"main": "Video Sweets: Judges With Ice Cream Cones and Kids With Candy", "kicker": "PLAYLIST"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "32", "word_count": 764, "_id": "4fd267128eb7c8105d81c2e9", "snippet": "Reviews of new releases by Will Young, Da Muzicianz, Three 6 Mafia, LMC and Rachel McFarlane, Cat Power and Ryoji Ikeda.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/arts/music/12play.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2006/02/12/arts/12play75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2006/02/12/arts/12play75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "POWER, CAT"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "IKEDA, RYOJI"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDINGS (AUDIO)"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Kelefa", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Sanneh"}], "original": "By Kelefa Sanneh"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2006-02-12T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "GENERAL MOTORS, once among the strongest of American companies, this week cut its dividend in half amid fears that it may eventually go bankrupt.
