The process seems simple enough, but the latest research on appetite control indicates that hunger and satiety actually come as the culmination of an internal chemical battle so complex that it is often hard to predict the winner. In fact, researchers are now discovering that so many biochemical signals contribute to determining when, what and how much people eat, that they doubt whether a single all-powerful mechanism of appetite control will ever be found to help solve most weight or health problems. Rather, specific therapies geared to individual problems with appetite regulation now seem to be the only hope for widespread success. As a clearer picture emerges of the intricate chain of chemical commands that govern hunger, satiety and eating patterns, the researchers are finding that some people have specific defects in appetite regulation that might be corrected by individualized therapy. Using different approaches, it may be possible, for example, to reduce the appetite of diabetics and ever-hungry bulimics and to stimulate that of cancer patients and people with depression or anorexia nervosa, which is characterized by an aversion to food.", "snippet": "MINNEAPOLISPeople commonly start eating when   their stomachs growl and stop eating when   they feel full.
