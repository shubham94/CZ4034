Salk, the developer of the first polio vaccine, was invited to New York for a ticker-tape parade in his honor, he declined and said the money would be better spent on scholarships for medical students. City officials took his suggestion and set up such a fund, awarding the first Salk Scholarships in 1955. Last night Dr. Salk was the featured guest as 225 people gathered at Windows on the World, on the 107th floor of the World Trade Center, to mark the 30th anniversary of the scholarships and to contribute $500 each toward a permanent endowment for the fund. 'Most Wonderful Thing' A minimum of eight graduating seniors from the various colleges of the City University have been designated Salk Scholars each year since 1955. Acceptance into a medical school is a prerequisite for the award.", "snippet": "Thirty years ago, when Dr. Jonas E.

Still, many are concerned about the nutrient losses and health hazards that might result from treating foods so that they don't spoil before reaching a table 5,000 miles or 10 months from where or when the food was produced or packaged. To the time-honored preservation techniques of salting, drying, smoking, canning and freezing, each of which has its own set of disadvantages, there have been added a dizzying array of newer chemical and physical methods to keep foods ''fresh'' - from fumigants and preservatives to waxes and plastic wraps to microwaves and radiation. At one time or another, objections have been raised by consumers and scientists to each of these newer methods. While the objections are sometimes valid and raise health-protecting red flags, in other cases they have prompted people to act irrationally to avoid foods presumed to be unwholesome.", "snippet": "MOST Americans enjoy their year-round access to an extraordinary variety of foods and would complain if they could not, for example, find tomatoes (fresh or canned) in January or orange juice in June.
