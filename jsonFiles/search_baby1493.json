holds that lunch programs provide key to survival of some elderly and for others provide only means of socializing; notes that hot lunches in NYC are being served daily to 30,000 elderly but, according to Mayor's Aging Office, there are 300,000 old people living at or below poverty level who are in 'desperate' need of programs; claims that nutritional problems of aged are particularly acute in NYC because 1 out of every 20 persons over 65 yrs of age lives in city; points out that elderly's avg annual income is about $2,100 or less for single person and $2,800 for married couple; finds that more than 135,000 old people in NYC are living on $1,318 a yr if single and $1,618 if married; notes that 1 of important strides toward meeting needs of elderly is new Fed program authorized under Title VII of Older Amers Act, which provides hot meals for persons over 60 and is currently operating in 54 centers in NYC that serve 150 people each; holds that these programs only reach portion of people for whom they are designed; Sen Select Com on Nutrition and Human Needs recently concluded that because of inadequate funding Title VII programs are not reaching 97% of target population nationally; NYC program admrs fear that even if Cong allocated same amt of money that was allocated in '73, programs will have to be cut back because of inflation; maintain that it is 'false econ' on part of Cong not to allocate more funds under Title VII because in many cases programs make difference between old person continuing to live at home or having to move to nursing home; contend that maintaining patient in nursing home is far more expensive than paying for his hot lunches; Mrs Gertrude Wagner, who runs Title VII food programs, cites example; Meals on Wheels program dir Frank Power discusses how he contacted Wildcat, rehabilitation orgn for former drug addicts and convicts, to supply drivers and people to carry food to elderly; article holds that hot lunches supply 1/3 of daily recommended allowance of nutrients; says there is underlying assumption that elderly will be able to meet remaining daily nutritional requirements; claims such an assumption is often false; Harvard Univ nutritionist Prof Jean Mayer and Columbia Univ nutritionists Dr Myron Winick and Dr Orrea Pye discuss nutritional requirements of elderly; article discusses efforts by Gerber Products Co, known for its baby foods, to mkt food for elderly;
