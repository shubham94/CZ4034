As recently as 1985, when the Supreme Court reversed one of its rare decisions based on the amendment (Garcia canceling Usery), the 10th was being called a dead letter. Certainly few people tried to ''take the 10th'' the way gangsters and fellow travelers ''took the fifth.'' But now the amendment has many takers. The Supreme Court used it in 1992, 1995 and 1997 and shows an eagerness to extend that run. Bob Dole, in his last year in the Senate, began carrying the words of the amendment around with him for instant recitation. Newt Gingrich's insurgents relied on it in 1994 to preach devolution of power from the Federal to the state level. Even President Clinton gives states the title Louis Brandeis thought up for them, ''laboratories of democracy.'' Gov.
