Somebody needed to make a comedy built around all of the holiday season hostility that goes up along with the decorations at this time of year. Mr. Zwigoff and the screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are just the guys for such a task. ''Bad Santa'' takes all of the Christmas season's bad vibes and converts them into an achingly funny and corrupt dark comedy. Mr. Thornton is Willie T. Stokes, a burned-out, hard-drinking safecracker who is annually roused from sleeping one off during the most wonderful time of the year by his dwarf partner, Marcus (Mr. Cox). As Marcus works as a department store elf, he also cases the store so that he and Willie can break in and relieve the joint of valuable merchandise. On this tour they have ended up in Phoenix, which just adds to the wealth of hilarious incongruity. As a director, Mr. Zwigoff has a taste for finding the dramatic power of self-loathing and making it entertainment. His previous films -- the documentary ''Crumb'' and his fiction-film debut, ''Ghost World'' -- both hinged on coping with epic tides of depression. ''Bad Santa'' falls directly into that lineage. Willie is filled with the most distorted kind of narcissism imaginable, and for Mr. Thornton it functions as a kind of star chemistry. Willie ladles it generously on the kids who line up to see him on his wobbly perch on Santa's throne: he's the kind of minimum-wage jackal who has sent his victims on to thousands of hours of therapy (Elvis Mitchell).", "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "13", "word_count": 2320, "_id": "4fd235d58eb7c8105d7c7834", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film.
