The history of birth injury to her head, which probably involved the pituitary and third ventricle (e.g. ''she still has an arched palate''), would provide a source for the syndrome. Her history of hyperphagia (excessive eating) is the typical symptom for damage to this region (though it is rare in humans). The onset immediately after birth further suggests that this is congenital and not the result of parental neglect. (An M.R.I. focusing on the area around the third ventricle could easily confirm or refute this hypothesis.) It is strange that the possible influence of brain injury was not given more consideration in this family's struggle.

I have taken care of children with similar attributes in the I.C.U., most of them heavyset. Even here in Manhattan, at major teaching hospitals, these patients' conditions are difficult to diagnose. The psychological trauma that stems from the separation of parents and child cannot be overemphasized. We already see the results in Anamarie: delayed speech, flat affect, reluctance to warm to strangers. There are a multitude of issues involved in this case: weight issues, medical, psychiatric and insurance issues, cultural issues. As a mother who has breast-fed three children, I cannot help but compare this with your recent article that mentioned a child who was removed from his home because the mother breast-fed too long. Nobody has the right to separate parents and children unless there is obvious abuse.
