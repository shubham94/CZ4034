Pinderhughes, the city's school superintendent, thought it would be a simple survey of teen-age attitudes on sex and health care, a vehicle to help curb teen-age pregnancies. But the project that originated with Mrs. Pinderhughes last spring and had the support of the school board as well as some members of the community has since stirred community protest to the point that the survey has been withdrawn and is being redesigned. The survey, compiled last September by a physician at Johns Hopkins Medical School, asked students in grades 7, 9 and 11 intimate details about their sex lives, drug habits, health care and school performance. The survey has generated a major controversy with racial overtones. The problem of teen-age pregnancies is a national problem, and Baltimore is high on the national list.", "snippet": "Alice G.
