I had a job, I owed no debt, I rented an apartment, I wasn't married. My knees didn't hurt when it rained. Then I got involved with McSweeney's, which, according to most dictionaries, is an old Gaelic word meaning ''trendy literary scene.'' My role in this scene was simple: the fool. Both in the magazine and in person, I started calling myself ''the Greatest Living American Writer.'' This ''Neal Pollack'' was an arrogant oaf who'd been everywhere, written about everything and slept with everyone. The real me could lay claim only to the oaf bit. Yet somehow people got confused, or pretended to get confused. Because those were ironic years, I deliberately created some of the confusion. And then I started getting confused myself. If creating a literary alter ego were a mistake, then Kinky Friedman wouldn't be a serious candidate for governor of Texas. But, and I speak with a voice of authority here, if you're going to create such a persona, make it a likable one. To do otherwise is to invite ruin, or at least nasty e-mail messages. For the last five years, I've lived with a dark, obnoxious fictional version of myself.
