Theater Broadway + 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories, from traffic cones into megaphones to garbage bags into evening gowns. But the whole production is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed Off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $95. BEN BRANTLEY * 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly half a century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by a young Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in 'The Little Shop of Horrors,' the initially blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of theater and television fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by brilliantly exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous. This show, as Edna sings, is ''all about me.'' It's a joy to be with a Broadway diva who doesn't pretend otherwise (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50. BRANTLEY * 'DEMOCRACY.' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice them, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters. It may take you 15 minutes or so to become oriented as to the rules and players on the drama's fragmented political field. But as you watch the well-oiled, highly polished 10-actor ensemble, led by James Naughton and Richard Thomas, you're likely to find yourself echoing the sentiments of a government functionary caught up in the surge of tension and relief in a closely fought voting session. ''Never mind football!'' he exclaims. ''Try parliamentary democracy!'' (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Today at 2 and 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95. BRANTLEY + 'THE GOOD BODY' In her tremendously popular ''Vagina Monologues,'' Eve Ensler exposed the connections between taboos about the discussion of female sexuality and women's oppression. Ms. Ensler has now moved on -- to her belly button. As she relates in ''The Good Body,'' ''I said the word vagina vagina vagina a million times. I thought I was home free. I had finally come to like my vagina. Until one day I realized the self-hatred had just crept up into my stomach.'' Like ''Vagina Monologues,'' ''The Good Body'' aims to uplift and to empower as it entertains. Ms. Ensler wants to soften the ever-fraught relationship between American women and their bodies. In between reflections on her own uncertain journey toward finding the beauty in imperfection, Ms. Ensler offers the perspectives of women she turned to for enlightenment. But the stylish production, directed by Peter Askin, can't obscure the fact that Ms. Ensler's new material is less compelling than the ''Vagina'' testimonials. Truly fresh insights are in short supply. Where ''Vagina Monologues'' broke new ground, ''Good Body'' mostly sticks to well-trodden pathways (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performances today at 2 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $81.25; a limited number of $26.25 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the performance. CHARLES ISHERWOOD + 'LAUGH WHORE' For indisputable evidence that comedy is fueled by anger, take a gander at Mario Cantone's face as he approaches a payoff line in ''Laugh Whore,'' his gussied-up stand-up-comedy show. The dancing eyebrows flatline. The jaw settles into a strained grimace. The soft brown eyes are transformed into bottomless pools of hostility. Mr. Cantone is in fact most appealing, and most hilarious, when he's seething his way through a tale of irritation, the voice spiraling suddenly from a friendly hum to a train whistle. Probably best known as one of the gay accessories sported by the ''Sex and the City'' gals to match their Manolos, Mr. Cantone is himself gay. Much of the funniest material in ''Laugh Whore'' is an expression of a buoyantly, exuberantly, even belligerently gay sensibility. The director Joe Mantello oversees this production, but much of it retains the formless feeling of a club routine. Structure and thematic design, not necessities in an hourlong club set, are more important for a two-hour, two-act Broadway engagement, and they are missing in action here. But if ''Laugh Whore'' may not prove to be the shapeliest of the many solo shows heading to a Broadway theater near you this fall, it is certainly a fine first salvo (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 2 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $81.25. ISHERWOOD + ' 'NIGHT, MOTHER' As your grandmother or therapist probably told you, there is something to be said for staying busy in a time of crisis. Playing a pair of women whose shared life is about to be torn asunder, Edie Falco and Brenda Blethyn have an ocean of household chores to swim through in the strangely uninvolving revival of Marsha Norman's '' 'Night, Mother,'' directed by Michael Mayer. Putting candy in jars, cleaning out the refrigerator, bagging garbage, folding towels, making cocoa: such tasks are sometimes enough even to eclipse the harsh awareness of Thelma Cates (Ms. Blethyn) that her daughter, Jessie (Ms. Falco), has announced that she will be killing herself in a couple of hours. On the other hand, all that domestic industry only rarely disguises our suspicion that these two first-rate actresses are never quite at home in their roles. Or the uneasy realization that Ms. Norman's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama is looking more artificial than it did 20 years ago (1:30). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25 to $86.25. BRANTLEY *+ 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988, directed by Mark Brokaw. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end you may feel as if you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling, sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. No matinee tomorrow. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51 to $79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show. BRANTLEY + 'WHOOPI' Whoopi Goldberg has been working in Hollywood for two decades now. Presumably she's met a lot of directors out there. But scan the program for Ms. Goldberg's solo show, which has returned to the Lyceum Theater on Broadway for a 20th-anniversary engagement, and you'll find none listed. The movie star and television personality has chosen to dispense with one in remounting her collection of monologues, just as she did when this career-igniting show made its debut on Broadway. Twenty years ago, the omission could be forgiven as the boundless confidence of a bright young talent. At 49, Ms. Goldberg is now an established performer, and the oversight looks more like folly. Ms. Goldberg remains an engaging presence, but this sluggish show desperately needs a stringent theatrical intelligence. Ms. Goldberg's most ardent fans may be happy to make the acquaintance of the half-dozen different characters she portrays here. But even the funniest monologues would benefit from judicious editing. ''Whoopi'' is still good company, to be sure. And yet, as anyone who has observed her eclectic career knows, she is perhaps not always the best judge of material. ''Whoopi'' offers further evidence that, innately incandescent though she may be, Ms. Goldberg's gifts shine brightest when they are strictly harnessed (1:30). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays at 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $76.25. ISHERWOOD *+ 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure onstage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naif of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly as ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 2 p.m. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101. BRANTLEY Off Broadway 'BELLE \u00c9POQUE' The poque doesn't seem so very belle in Martha Clarke and Charles L. Mee's ambitious attempt to distill onstage the seedy, absinthe-tinted glamour that Toulouse-Lautrec captured in oils and pastels in late 19th-century Paris. As in their prior collaboration, ''Vienna: Lusthaus,'' the authors seek to strip away the sentimental varnish that has congealed around popular depictions of the milieu they are exploring. Ms. Clarke and Mr. Mee are intrigued by the gloom beneath the gaiety. ''Belle \u00c9poque'' focuses on the painter who immortalized the denizens of Montmartre in his art. Mark Povinelli, an actor whose small stature belies a sizable force, plays Toulouse-Lautrec. He is surrounded by an eccentric array of performers who plied their trade in the clubs of Montmartre. With the aid of Jane Greenwood's plush, gorgeously detailed costumes and Christopher Akerlind's invigorating lighting, the production casts a seductive visual spell. And Ms. Clarke's staging has a bustling freedom that is a fine theatrical metaphor for the restless speed of Toulouse-Lautrec's acute eye, forever settling on unexpected moments and awkward poses. But the musical and visual enticements of ''Belle \u00c9poque'' are encumbered by Mr. Mee's text, which often strikes an arch, discordant note (1:25). Mitzi E. Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m; Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $70. ISHERWOOD * 'DOUBT: A PARABLE' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. (Think ''The Children's Hour'' crossed with ''Agnes of God.'') But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. BRANTLEY 'FIVE BY TENN' This selection of Tennessee Williams one-acts offers little cause for excitement. The four recently discovered plays are of some academic interest, but sparkling gems they aren't. The director Michael Kahn employs an actor portraying Williams himself to introduce the plays, a faintly apologetic gesture. ''Summer at the Lake,'' written in 1937, features principal characters who prefigure the combative mother and son in ''The Glass Menagerie.'' The play is just a fragment truncated by a melodramatic ending, but the voice already bears the hallmarks of Williams's style. But elsewhere, the voice is diluted, distorted or disguised. In ''The Fat Man's Wife,'' from 1938, Williams is trying on a faux-urbane manner that fits him like a rented tuxedo in the wrong size. The major disappointment is ''And Tell Sad Stories of the Deaths of Queens,'' from around 1959, a sour story of a transvestite's degradation at the hands of a sailor, and one of a very few plays in which Williams dealt directly with homosexuality (3:00). Manhattan Theater Club, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. No matinee tomorrow. Tuesdays through Sundays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $48; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets available at the box office up to an hour before the performance. ISHERWOOD 'THE FOREIGNER' The Cinderella schlemiel has clearly become Matthew Broderick's most trusted onstage alter-ego. Having buffed this persona to a high sheen as the inhibited accountant Leopold Bloom in the hit Broadway musical ''The Producers,'' Mr. Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There's no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. The production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, which includes Frances Sternhagen and Kevin Cahoon, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25. BRANTLEY * 'THE GOD OF HELL' Sam Shepard's robust new farce, which he has described as ''a takeoff on Republican fascism,'' is neither a smooth nor subtle play. But at its best it has a punch-drunk paranoia that brings to mind Mr. Shepard's salad days as the ultimate wild young dramatist of several decades ago. Directed by Lou Jacob, this 90-minute portrait of an old-time America invaded by a cruel new breed of Americans starts off much more satisfyingly than it finishes. And what it has to say about a nation forced to march in regimental lockstep is pretty standard agitprop. But unlike, say, the more literal-minded ''Embedded,'' Tim Robbins's satire about the invasion of Iraq, ''The God of Hell'' pokes fun at its own righteous self as well as its broad political targets. The show's top-of-the-line cast is led by Randy Quaid and J. Smith-Cameron, who are priceless as a politically na\u00efve farming couple in rural Wisconsin (1:20). Actors Studio Drama School Theater, 151 Bank Street, (212) 279-4200. Mondays, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60. BRANTLEY *+ 'GUANT\u00c1NAMO: ''HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM'' ' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: you are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. First produced in London by the Tricycle Theater, this calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge that is never achieved by flashier agitprop satire (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Added performance today at 3 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $60. BRANTLEY 'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays. ISHERWOOD * 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and na\u00efve, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country. Bush foes expecting a polemical broadside will be disappointed. Ms. Raffo drew on more than 10 years of interviews to assemble her theatrical mosaic, and the commendable results reveal that she is a journalist, not a purveyor of propaganda. There is plenty here to fuel outrage at the suffering of Iraqi citizens directly caused by American bombing. But Mr. Raffo's women also bear witness to the monstrousness of Saddam Hussein's regime, with more than one of the play's characters fiercely avowing that no price is too high to pay for ridding the country of his brutality (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, (212) 925-1900. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60. ISHERWOOD 'PEOPLE ARE WRONG!' A Manhattan couple seeking relief from city stress finds country living more treacherous than expected in this good-natured but ragged rock musical at the Vineyard Theater, a co-production with the Target Margin Theater. A lively young cast infuses the proceedings with comic high spirits even when the musical begins to spin its wheels, or spin out of control. John Flansburgh, one-half of the popular rock duo They Might Be Giants, makes his Off-Broadway debut as one of the luckless country weekenders. He is married to Robin Goldwasser, who wrote the musical with Julia Greenberg. Ms. Greenberg and Ms. Goldwasser are rock songwriters who have never before attempted a full-scale musical. They know their way around a catchy guitar riff and slip comfortably between lilting folk balladry, driving electric-guitar romps and rockabilly hoedowns. Unfortunately, once the musical has established the simple storyline (crazy gardener screws up wedding plans) and put across its sardonic tone, it begins to disintegrate, even as the song list stretches past the horizon (there are 30 tunes) (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 5 and 9 p.m. Tickets: $55. ISHERWOOD 'A SECOND HAND MEMORY' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Snapshots from the past reveal layers of guilt, dissatisfaction and recrimination in the family history. Emotional entrapment, and the desperation it causes, have become obsessive themes in Mr. Allen's work, and they constitute almost the whole fabric of ''A Second Hand Memory.'' Amid the pervasive aura of doom, Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors, who include Dominic Chianese of ''The Sopranos'' and a particularly fine Beth Fowler, provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences before our eyes, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $60. ISHERWOOD *+ 'SIN (A CARDINAL DEPOSED)' Sins come in assorted sizes, but it's hard to take the full measure of the misdeeds exposed in this sober play about the sexual-abuse scandal that unfolded in New England over the past decades. Michael Murphy's quietly disturbing play, drawn from documentary evidence, reveals with devastating clarity the dubious role that Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston, played in a tragedy that irreparably damaged hundreds of families and destroyed more than a few lives. The play is a theatrically unadorned re-enactment of a literal deposition given by Cardinal Law in the presence of a pair of lawyers and one of the victims of abuse pursuing a civil case against the church. The play is inevitably static. But listen closely, and a chilling drama can be detected beneath the restrained talk about notes scrawled on decades-old letters. It's the exposure of the moral and bureaucratic mechanics behind the church's failure to protect its members from the destructive acts of its priests. Perhaps also visible, underneath the strained but cordial mask of propriety presented by John Cullum, who plays Cardinal Law, is another drama, the public stripping away of a man's illusions about his moral righteousness (1:30). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $51.25. ISHERWOOD + 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 505-0700. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER + 'TRYING' The indignities of aging assume aspects both touching and comic in ''Trying,'' a slight and sentimental new play by Joanna McClelland Glass that is given a measure of ballast by a gracious, subtly turned performance from Fritz Weaver. Mr. Weaver plays Francis Biddle, a lawyer whose distinguished career included stints as the United States attorney general under Franklin D. Roosevelt and as a judge at the Nuremberg trials, in Ms. Glass's stage memoir about her youthful days as Biddle's secretary. Ms. Glass's stand-in, Sarah Schorr (Kati Brazda), is a young wife fresh from academe and new to Washington, when she begins working for Biddle, here depicted as a frosty curmudgeon whose pride in his achievements and his patrician heritage is continually affronted by the unmistakable signs of his declining physical and intellectual powers. Mr. Weaver gives a wonderfully conscientious performance, imbuing his character with a moving sense of aggrieved dignity that tempers the writing's occasional tendencies to reduce him to a cutely exasperating old fogey. But the scope of Mr. Weaver's performance is limited by the writing (2:15). Promenade, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 3 p.m. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25. ISHERWOOD + 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudit\u00e9s. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Added performance today at 3 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60. BRANTLEY Movies A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. Now Playing 'AFTER THE SUNSET' Starring Pierce Brosnan, Salma Hayek and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Brett Ratner (PG-13, 93 minutes). You'd have to search high and low to find screen lovers with less romantic chemistry than Mr. Brosnan and Ms. Hayek in ''After the Sunset,'' a jewel-heist frolic so stale it feels like a retread of a retread. Mr. Brosnan has finally reached the age of flab, and the sight of Ms. Hayek's extravagant cleavage spilling over his hairy paunch isn't especially pretty. Even by the fanciful rules of caper comedies, ''After the Sunset'' is a fraudulent entertainment. Except for the opening chase, its action sequences are strictly routine, and the overall tone strains after a wit and style that appear far beyond the director's grasp. STEPHEN HOLDEN 'ALFIE' Starring Jude Law. Directed by Charles Shyer (R, 103 minutes). It's the year of the monkey in the Chinese calendar and the year of the hound in Hollywood. In films as radically different as ''Sideways,'' ''Ray'' and now ''Alfie,'' men are sniffing skirts with a single-mindedness that brings to mind Warren Beatty cruising through ''Shampoo,'' a blow-dryer tucked in his jeans. Filled with womanizers who at once love too much and not quite enough, these films don't really resurrect the hound and, in truth, he never went away. They simply ask you to look deep in those puppy eyes and see the all-too-human man beneath, quivering with heartfelt need, not just animal impulse. Men often behave sexually badly in movies, but it's rare that the hound doesn't get his comeuppance. It's usually only in comedy that such beasts stay true to their baser selves, as in ''Bad Santa,'' where Billy Bob Thornton's womanizing is a self-consciously nasty piece with his boozing and cursing. The comedy in ''Alfie'' is plentiful but bittersweet, and the character's bad behavior pleases more than it repels, principally because Mr. Law's beauty and easy charm go a long way to softening the edges. MANOHLA DARGIS 'ALEXANDER' Starring Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 173 minutes). There comes the moment in the career of many directors when they are compelled to tell the story of a great man in whose life they seem to see a glimmer of their own image. Francis Ford Coppola had Preston Tucker, the automotive innovator who tried and failed to challenge Detroit in much the same way as the filmmaker took on Hollywood, while Martin Scorsese and Mel Gibson each had Jesus. Now, Oliver Stone has Alexander the Great, the Macedonian tyrant who cut a bloody swath through the ancient world to no obvious end other than, if Mr. Stone's big, blowsy movie is to believed, get away from his kvetch of a mother. And what a kvetch she was! Mad of eye and teased of hair, Olympias, played with nose-flaring gusto by Ms. Jolie, was the mother of all monstrous mothers, a literal snake charmer whose love for her only son had the stench of incestuous passion and the tedium of the perpetual nag. For Alexander (Mr. Farrell, upstaged by an epically bad dye job), the oedipal plot would only thicken because he also loved Olympias's most loathed enemy, her husband and his father, Philip, the King of Macedon (Mr. Kilmer). The struggle between Olympias and Philip, these primordial warring female and male forces, would be reproduced in both Alexander's bisexual desires and his rapacious conquest of the feminized East. In other words, Alexander became his dad to waylay his mom. DARGIS * 'BAD EDUCATION' Starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Fele Mart\u00ednez and Javier C\u00e1mara. Directed by Pedro Almod\u00f3var (NC-17; 110 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). The great Spanish director's newest film is a delirious, headlong immersion and reinvention of film noir, a style that has lured countless film makers onto its treacherous shoals. Mr. Almod\u00f3var, unlike other filmmakers who lose their bearings, fully understands the degree to which the genre is synonymous with fantasy and a primal longing for the forbidden. The coup de grace of ''Bad Education,'' which ricochets back and forth between 1964 and 1980, with a finale set mostly in 1977, is that here the femme fatale is a predatory transsexual named Ignacio. Once a beautiful boy soprano, he/she was abused by a priest, the principal in his Catholic boys school. As the film deepens and the characters' mistaken and multiple identities accumulate, the priest returns from the past in a new, desperate guise. ''Bad Education'' contemplates the wonder of storytelling itself and the human instinct to embroider reality to make the tales we tell more real and conclusive, if less strictly factual. It insists that stories, the stories within stories, and the fantasies they crystallize, are the best (and maybe the only) tools at our disposal for making sense of it all. HOLDEN 'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her longtime director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair -- from rapture to heartbreak to revenge -- the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core, and Mr. Evans has all the sexual magnetism of a boiled potato. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Bening gallantly, and she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will. A.O. SCOTT 'BIRTH' Starring Nicole Kidman. Directed by Jonathan Glazer (R, 100 minutes). A metaphysical puzzle -- part ghost story, part melodrama -- in which Ms. Kidman plays Anna, a wealthy Manhattan widow, who meets a young boy claiming to be her dead husband. The premise is strange, almost preposterous, but Mr. Glazer presents it with a hushed, solemn intensity that keeps you in a state of pleasurable disorientation. The screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re wrote many scripts for Luis Bu\u00f1uel, and there is an element of arch surrealism in this tale, which might be cold and mechanical were it not for Ms. Kidman's performance. ''Birth'' doesn't just ask you to suspend disbelief, but to let go of reason, an invitation that is worth accepting if you can. SCOTT 'BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON' Starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Directed by Beeban Kidron (R, 108 minutes). What was Ms. Zellweger thinking? It can't have been fun to put on all that weight, especially for a film as ghastly as this, and it sure won't be fun taking it off again. And what is the appeal of Bridget Jones? More to the point, what is the appeal of laughing at her swishing thighs, her lack of both charm and obvious intelligence? At the screening a lot of women were cackling lustily every time the camera zoomed in on Bridget's bulbous posterior, which of course looks much like the posterior of most women who don't live for Pilates and in Beverly Hills. Ms. Kidron took obvious delight in this unhappy view, too. She either really disliked her star or thinks humiliating other women is great sport. Whatever the case, you have to wonder why all these women (you go, sister!) relish the spectacle of a normally well-coiffed, highly paid Academy Award-winning actress, who dates rock stars no less, looking so bad. Unlike Sharon Maguire, who directed ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' Ms. Kidron goes out of her way to make the character unattractive, sticking the camera under Bridget's chin and doing nothing nice with the lighting. Bridget is pleasantly plump in the first movie, as plush and appealing as an Eiderdown comforter, but here she's a greasy, bumbling, waddling train wreck. Doesn't the poor thing read fashion magazines or go shopping in London's boutiques and groovy outdoor markets? Doesn't she wash her hair? DARGIS 'CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS' Starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by Joe Roth (PG, 94 minutes). Lockstep suburban conformism enforced with a fascist rigor is the ugly (but admittedly sometimes funny) joke driving this family comedy with a screenplay by Chris Columbus, adapted from John Grisham's novel ''Skipping Christmas.'' The movie is as slick and treacherous as the sheet of ice its Scrooge-like protagonist (Mr. Allen) freezes in the yard of his lawn to discourage holiday panhandlers. Until he stumbles upon it in an act of giving, he doesn't realize there is only one true path to the saccharine suffocation of ''It's a Wonderful Life.'' Its name is Hemlock Street, and he happens to live on it with his wife (Ms. Curtis) and their grown daughter (Julie Gonzalo). For all you fancy-schmancy snobs who jet off to St. Bart's for the holidays, the movie has an important message, and you'd better pay attention. If you shirkers refuse to stay home and celebrate Christmas like the rest of us, we don't want you in our community. HOLDEN 'FEAR AND TREMBLING' Starring Sylvie Testud and Kaori Tsuji. Directed by Alain Corneau (not rated, 102 minutes; in French and Japanese, with English subtitles). Like ''Lost in Translation,'' Mr. Corneau's film, adapted from an autobiographical novel by Am\u00e9lie Nothomb, concerns a young woman undergoing a painful and comical process of self-discovery in a Tokyo high-rise. The heroine, Am\u00e9lie (Ms. Testud) has moved from Belgium to Japan, where she spent her early childhood, and where she takes a job working for a large corporation in the hopes of becoming ''a real Japanese woman.'' It's a doomed project, owing both the the long-standing Japanese suspicion of foreigners and to the intricate codes and hierarchies that govern Am\u00e9lie's workplace. What starts as a breezy exercise in office anthropology becomes a harrowing, sometimes hilarious exploration of bureaucratic sado-masochism, a blend of ''The Office'' and ''The Story of O'' trasplanted to Asia. SCOTT 'FINDING NEVERLAND' Starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. Directed by Marc Forster (PG, 108 minutes). Steeped in melancholy, the strange story of J. M. Barrie, the Victorian who wrote ''Peter Pan,'' has the makings of a marvelous tale and one doozy of a case history. Born in Scotland in 1860, Barrie was a playwright and novelist who, after meeting a family stuffed with young boys, created in 1904 a classic of children's literature. In the years since, ''Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up'' has been revisited numerous times, as in the splendid 1952 Disney animation, and has become an emblem for everlasting youth, both healthy and less so. Mary Martin soared as Peter Pan; Michael Jackson crashed. As Barrie in ''Finding Neverland,'' a handsome-looking film about the writer and his unripe inspirations, Mr. Depp neither soars nor crashes, but moseys forward with vague purpose and actorly restraint. Based on the play by Allan Knee, ''The Man Who Was Peter Pan,'' the film mainly concerns the period during which Barrie met and befriended the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Ms. Winslet) and her brood of boys. The filmmakers work hard to let us know that it's the mother who's the more obvious focus of the writer's attention than her children and the two adult actors exchange suitably noble looks even when Ms. Winslet's d\u00e9colletage threatens to play peek-a-boo. It's all terribly polite, not a little dull and remote. DARGIS 'THE GRUDGE' Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr. Directed by Takashi Shimizu (PG-13, 110 minutes). The haunted house in ''The Grudge'' isn't draped with cobwebs, but every so often, it issues an unsettling creak that sounds like the shifting of delicate old bones. Located in Tokyo up a long driveway where dead leaves skitter like mice, the house has been home to so many victims that it has taken five movies to chronicle their unfortunate demise. All the films in the series were directed by Mr. Shimizu, who also wrote all but this one; the first four, rather bewilderingly, carry some variation on the Japanese title ''Ju-On,'' which has to do with the notion of vengeance. The film nominally pivots on Ms. Gellar, from television's ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' as Karen, an American social-work student living in Tokyo. Along with her boyfriend, Doug (Mr. Behr), an American architecture student who reads books titled, yes, ''Japanese Architecture,'' Karen is making a go in a strange new land that only gets stranger when she visits that creaky house on the hill. After another health-care worker goes missing, Karen has to walk up that hill to care for a catatonic older woman, Emma (the spooky Grace Zabriskie), who seems to have been left home alone. Creak goes the house as something that sounds like a cat going meo-o-o-ow. DARGIS * 'KINSEY' Starring Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Peter Sarsgaard. Directed by Bill Condon (R, 118 minutes). Mr. Neeson is flawless as Alfred Kinsey, the zoologist whose research into human sexual behavior helped to transform American attitudes about matters of the flesh. Though it has its share of carnality, Mr. Condon's wise and witty biography is, above all, an intellectual turn-on, its romance fueled by Kinsey's scientific zeal and his ardent, almost na\u00efve belief that knowledge is not only power, but freedom. While acknowledging his personal failings and misjudgment, the film regards its hero with affection and gratitude, and makes its case for his legacy with tact and care. Though it sometimes falls into biopic convention, explaining what it should dramatize and dramatizing what it should imply, the film is rich with humanity and insight. Crisp performances by Ms. Linney, as Kinsey's wife, and Mr. Sarsgaard, as his first research assistant bring the complexities of Kinsey's life into sharp relief. SCOTT 'LA PETITE LILI' Starring Nicole Garcia, Bernard Giraudeau, Jean-Pierre Marielle and Ludivine Sagnier. Directed by Claude Miller (not rated, 104 minutes; in French, with subtitles). In dragging ''The Seagull'' into the age of cellphones, digital video and hip-hop, the ingeniously freewheeling adaptation of Chekhov's 1895 play stirs up a fascinating and contradictory mixture of the eternal and the transitory. But there are hurdles that ''La Petite Lili'' cannot overcome. Abridged and abbreviated, Chekhov's leisurely philosophic reflections evoke a musty aroma of pressed flowers in a scrapbook that's out of tune with the times. The rush to abridge leaves little room for what's left to seep into your bones. In the revelatory final act, many of the original characters converge on a movie set to recreate the events we have already seen. The movie within a movie is a small coup de cin\u00e9ma. HOLDEN * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Garc\u00eda Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon. SCOTT 'NATIONAL TREASURE' Starring Nicolas Cage. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 125 minutes). Maybe, just maybe, an 8-year old could pick up an interest in American history from watching ''National Treasure,'' that is if the child can stay awake through this sluggish two-hour trudge through landmarks in Washington, Philadelphia and New York. It's far more likely, however, that a child who can stay awake through the movie will come away believing the bogus mythology that detonates this fanciful reality game show (a Grade C ''Amazing Race'') with a squishy thud. That mythology, derived from Freemasonry, holds that a map, drawn in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence, contains clues to the whereabouts of the Greatest Treasure Ever Told About. A more cynical (and witless, shoddy) chase for Hollywood gold is hard to imagine. HOLDEN * 'RAY' Starring Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington and Regina King. Directed by Taylor Hackford (PG-13, 152 minutes). Mr. Hackford's biography of Ray Charles does not entirely avoid the psychologizing, sentimental traps of the genre, but it is nonetheless a potent and invigorating portrait of genius, thanks to Mr. Foxx's performance and to the music of Charles himself. The filmmakers have the good judgment to place the music at the center of the drama, and the movie is full of insights into Charles's innovations and working methods. We witness, in a series of well-executed set pieces, his evolution from a Nat King Cole-style crooner into an R & B innovator, and then into a performer, arranger and composer who seemed able to span the whole range of American vernacular music. Mr. Foxx, whose speech and movement uncannily resemble Charles's, contributes much more than mimicry. You get the sense that he understands his character completely and can communicate what he knows without stooping to explanation. The story of musical accomplishment is framed by the usual trials and triumphs of celebrity, but a handful of fine supporting performances -- notably Ms. Washington as Charles's wife, Della Bea, and Ms. King as one of his backup singers -- gives it a feeling of life being lived, rather than just acted out. SCOTT 'SHALL WE DANCE?' Starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 106 minutes). This Americanization of a popular 1996 Japanese film is an old-fashioned feel-good fantasy that piles on the euphoria. The movie returns Mr. Gere to the site of his hoofing triumph in ''Chicago.'' His character is a mild-mannered estate lawyer, happily married with two teenage children, who on an impulse starts taking evening ballroom dancing classes. As he evolves from bland suburban frog into suave dance-floor prince, he regains his faltering zest for life and refreshes his marriage (to Ms. Sarandon). Ms. Lopez, in full sizzle, is the dedicated instructor who teaches him that ballroom dancing, as she puts it, is ''a vertical expression of a horizontal wish.'' HOLDEN 'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale. SCOTT * 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. Directed by Mr. Payne, who adapted the screenplay with his long-time writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book by Rex Pickett, ''Sideways'' is about a man on the verge of saying uncle to life. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack it's an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future. DARGIS * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade. DARGIS Rock/Pop A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. BLUES EXPLOSION, THE GOSSIP, Asbury Lanes, 209 4th Avenue, Asbury Park, N.J., (732) 776-6160; Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Blues Explosion, the long-in-the-tooth retro-rock band that used to be called the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, somehow failed to capitalize during the great retro-rock feeding frenzy of a few years ago, perhaps because Mr. Spencer's hammy snarl has aged less well than bandmate Judah Bauer's well-oiled guitar lines. So don't be surprised if the veterans are upstaged by the Gossip, a barebones blues-punk band led by Beth Ditto, possessed of an appealing shivery wail. Sunday night at 9 at the venerable bowling alley Asbury Lanes, with Mike Edison; tickets are $15. Monday night at 9 at Maxwell's; tickets are $15. KELEFA SANNEH EVAN DANDO, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. From his days with the Lemonheads to his fitful solo career, Evan Dando at his best, has been able to wrap winsome melodies around chronicles of uncertain romance and an unkempt life, in songs like ''If I Could Talk I'd Tell You.'' Tomorrow night at 10, with the Shore opening; admission is $15. JON PARELES * BRITT DANIEL, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Mr. Daniel leads Spoon, a great Texas indie-rock band that wastes neither time nor notes. Spoon's last album, ''Kill the Moonlight,'' was one of 2002's best, a minor masterpiece that reduced every song to a series of gestures: a dash of falsetto, a couple of keyboard notes, a swaggering ''Awright!'' When he sang, ''We could go kick down some doors together/ Stay out till morning, sharp as knives,'' it sounded like the best idea in the world. At this solo show, expect the diehard Spoon fans to feast on whatever he sees to fit to play -- including, perhaps, some previews of Spoon's new album, due to be released sometime next year. Tonight at 10; tickets are $12. SANNEH * DIPLO, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Riving Street, Lower East Side, www.rothkonyc.com. Diplo, one half of the Philadelphia indie-crunk DJ team Hollertronix, comes to town for a Saturday night dance party. Earlier this year, he released a grab-bag solo album, ''Florida'' (Big Dada), but more exciting is his new gig as DJ for M.I.A., the Sri-Lanka-born, London-based rapper and singer and chanter whose debut album is due out early next year. Together, Diplo and M.I.A. just released a fantastic mixtape, ''Piracy Funds Terrorism Volume 1,'' which is better than most proper debut albums; don't leave Rothko without one. Tomorrow night at 11, with Spank Rock; admission is $10. SANNEH DISCO BISCUITS, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500. The Disco Biscuits have worked their way up the jam-band circuit with blithe rock that veers toward funk and jazz, hovers in circling, hypnotic riffs and sometimes turns into a live version of electronica styles, like drum-and-bass, that are usually concocted on computers. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $20. PARELES DR. JOHN, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and his florid piano playing not just to New Orleans funk and rhythm-and-blues but to Ellington, standards and songs with a conscience, though his latest album circles back to some New Orleans classics. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $30 in advance, $35 day of the show. PARELES * ELY GUERRA, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Ely Guerra is one of the most intriguing songwriters in Mexican rock. Ms. Guerra sings about passion: gazing at it from a distance, then plunging into the turbulence. Her songs incorporate rock, electronica and the torchy emotion of Mexican pop in a shifting balance of poise and obsession. She has just released a new album, ''Sweet & Sour, Hot y Spicy'' (Higher Octave). Sunday night at 7:30 and 9:30; admission is $20. PARELES ARLO GUTHRIE, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-7800. Arlo Guthrie is a master of the tall tale, whether he's singing it or spinning it between songs. He has the gift of making a casual observation both funny and telling. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $38-$65. PARELES HOT TUNA, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212) 496-7070. The guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and the bassist Jack Casady started Hot Tuna as a side project from the Jefferson Airplane, but it has now long outlasted the original band. Mr. Kaukonen plays spiky, fingerpicked blues that calmly contemplate death and loss, still harking back to the Rev. Gary Davis, with Mr. Casady's bass shadowing him from below. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $38.50 and $48.50. PARELES * JADAKISS, DON OMAR, the Roxy, 515 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-5156. The Yonkers rapper Jadakiss has long been an underground hero, beloved for his slightly rough voice that just makes his clever, deadpan lyrics sound that much smoother. He's having his biggest year ever, buoyed by the success of his marvelous hit single ''Why?,'' and the follow-up, a thug-love duet with Mariah Carey called, ''U Make Me Wanna.'' He is to be joined by Don Omar, one of reggaeton's biggest stars, who delighted a sold-out Madison Square Garden last month with his infectious refrains and with his trouser-dropping -- expect less trouser dropping, but just as many refrains, at this concert. Tonight at 8, with the former Terror Squad member Cuban Link; tickets are $35. SANNEH EDDIE AND GERALD LEVERT, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, L.I., (516) 334-0800. This concert pairs Eddie Levert, who was one of the gospel-charged soul singers in the O'Jays, with his son Gerald, who plays the rhythm-and-blues Casanova with alternating promises of fidelity and bedroom skills. Tonight at 8; tickets are $56.50. PARELES * LUNA/PALOMAR, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Embracing the legacy of two-guitar New York bands from the Velvet Underground to Television, Luna applies the dynamics of strum, drone and build to Dean Wareham's tales of longing and decadence. As Mr. Wareham sings about high-toned parties, aimless roadtrips and creeping paranoia, the songs start out cool, but the writhing, swelling guitars reveal the obsessions within them. The band is on its final tour, to end early next year. Whimsy and sinew co-exist nicely in the lean, peppy pop-rock of Palomar, a three-woman, one-man band whose songs jump from blithe choruses to wiry guitar patterns to hefty distortion, all at the service of the lyrics' articulate ambivalence. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $18.75 in advance, $20 day of the show. PARELES * BOB MOULD, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. As the main songwriter for Husker Du, Bob Mould wrapped troubled thoughts in blaring, unstoppable guitars. Since then, he has veered between melodic punk-rock with Sugar and more introspective songs under his own name. Tonight at 9, with Alex Dezen of the Damnwells opening; admission is $17. PARELES O.A.R., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224 . A little reggae, a little folk-rock, a lot of word-of-mouth and O.A.R., an Ohio band whose initials stand for Of a Revolution, has become a college-circuit favorite. Despite its name, O.A.R. is more concerned with romance than politics; it plays easy-strumming three-chord songs suitable for dorm parties, calling for audience participation on choruses like ''Naked with you all night long.'' John Butler is an Australian guitarist who, like Ben Harper, turns thoughtful songs into guitar and slide-guitar excursions. Tonight and tomorrow at 6:30, with the John Butler Trio opening tonight and the Virginia Coalition opening tomorrow; tickets are $30. PARELES * STRAYLIGHT RUN, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. An emo concert headlined by Straylight Run, the Long Island piano-rock act that includes a pair of former Taking Back Sunday members. The band's self-titled debut album (released last month by Victory Records) has a few too many mild ballads, but the members have a knack for writing big choruses that are just unpredictable enough to keep you listening. Expect a roaring sing-along to ''Existentialism on Prom Night,'' which includes a shameless -- and clever -- refrain that begs for crowd participation: ''Sing like you think no one's listening.'' Sunday night at 7, with Hot Rod Circuit, Northstar and Say Anything; tickets are $13. SANNEH * CHRIS WHITLEY, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Chris Whitley is steeped in the blues: not good-timey bar-band music but steely, tormented reflections on sin and self-destruction, betrayal and redemption. As he sings about a world of uncertainty and pain, his voice slides while his slide-guitar moans along. Tomorrow night at 8, with Paul Brill opening; tickets are $15 in advance, $17 tomorrow. PARELES Cabaret A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blas\u00e9 but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30. STEPHEN HOLDEN * ANDREA MARCOVICCI, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. Authentic glamour may be an oxymoron. But Ms. Marcovicci becomes its embodiment when she performs. In her new show, ''Andrea Sings Astaire,'' she suggests a latter-day hybrid of Audrey Hepburn, the most gracious, elegant and beautifully spoken of Hollywood princesses, and Mabel Mercer, that ruefully witty, all-wise, healing muse of a thousand romantic sorrows. Like Mercer's, her singing is really speech-song executed with an elocutionary flourish and stylized acting. The show weaves music, biography and analysis of Astaire iconography into a definitive career summary. It focuses, in particular, on his relationships with the composers who wrote for him. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $60, with a $55 dinner required at the early shows and a $20 minimum at the late shows. HOLDEN BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $95. HOLDEN Jazz A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S MILLENNIAL TERRITORY ORCHESTRA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. The trumpeter Steven Bernstein leads his nine-piece mini-big band through Midwestern and Southwestern music of the 1930's with a revisionist, excitable cast of mind. Sets are tonight at 8 and 10; admission is $10. BEN RATLIFF * SASHA DOBSON/CHRIS BYARS OCTET, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369. The young singer Sasha Dobson performed a lot with the saxophonist Chris Byars at the old jazz club Smalls, whose owner changed locations and called his new place the Fat Cat. With the recent launching of Small Records and her own release on the label, ''The Darkling Thrush,'' Ms. Dobson returns to her old audience in a new setting. She's a canny improviser with classic Ella-and-Sarah tastes and good pitch; Mr. Byars's arrangements of standards fit her handsomely. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 10; cover charge is $10. RATLIFF LOU DONALDSON QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. The saxophonist Lou Donaldson reminds you of the earthiness inside jazz. He is also a wild, funny character who always plays better than you expect on an average night. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30. RATLIFF STAN GETZ BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2121. The ubiquitous pianist Bill Charlap, along with the singer Claudia Acu\u00f1a and the Brazilian jazz band Trio da Paz, play alongside the tenor saxophonist Harry Allen in honor of Getz's New York-to-Rio recorded legacy. Sets tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10, and 11:30, with sets at 8:45 and 10:30 on Sunday; cover charge is $32.50; minimum, $10. RATLIFF RUSSELL GUNN AND ETHNOMUSICOLOGY, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Russell Gunn, from St. Louis, is a young hard-core jazz trumpeter who has worked behind R & B stars; logically, he seems to want his work to build a sensible bridge between the jazz and neo-soul audiences. He has a separate, mainstream jazz band, but with Ethnomusicology, he wants to relax you with soul ballads, then to challenge you with crunching dissonance and hard funk. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $25 and $20 on Sunday. RATLIFF * COLEMAN HAWKINS CELEBRATION WITH ERIC ALEXANDER AND GEORGE COLEMAN, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595. This is the centennial of the great Coleman Hawkins's birth, and the tribute concerts have been going strong; this one might be particularly good because it's essentially a working group, with Harold Mabern on piano, rather than an ad-hoc confection. The young tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander is probably more indebted to 50's- and 60's-era models like John Coltrane and George Coleman, who appears alongside him in this band. But he and his muse will surely sound good playing ''Body and Soul'' and other Hawkinsiana. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $30; $10 at the tables, $5 at the bar. RATLIFF * MARK HELIAS'S OPEN LOOSE, Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319. The bassist Mark Helias has been a reliable part of a lot of groups around New York for the last few decades, but his own trio is the best setting in which to hear him, as it engages his compositional sense as well as his convincing bounce. With the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby and the drummer Tom Rainey, he steams through winding themes and great ostinato grooves. Tonight at 8:30; cover charge is $10. RATLIFF VICTOR LEWIS GROUP, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Victor Lewis is a marvelous drummer, known in the 80's for associations with Stan Getz and Bobby Watson and in the 90's for freelancing and playing with his own band. This one includes the saxophonist Seamus Blake and the trumpeter Terrell Stafford. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20; $10 minimum. RATLIFF * BRIAN LYNCH AND SPHERES OF INFLUENCE, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. With a recent Doris Duke Foundation grant, Mr. Lynch wrote new music for his band Spheres of Influence, expanding the group in the process; it's now a nonet, with some of the most exciting musicians in the new Latin-jazz scene including the saxophonist Miguel Zenon, the pianist Luis Perdomo and the percussionist Pedro Martinez. Tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set. RATLIFF HOUSTON PERSON QUARTET, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue near 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 427-0253. The saxophonist Houston Person's background is in the 1950's, when a good deal of jazz was completely submerged in rhythm-and-blues, and he is one of the few mainstream jazz performers today who can routinely find access to the deep language of pleasure from that time. (Many of the others became session musicians, going deeper into the studiousness of jazz or into the meat and potatoes of rock 'n' roll, or they disappeared.) Mr. Person has an elastic, sequential solo-building style that links him to Sonny Rollins, and a fat, breathy tone that links him to Ben Webster. Enjoy him. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $20, and there is a one drink minimum. RATLIFF TOOTS THIELEMANS-KENNY WERNER-OSCAR CASTRO-NEVES-AIRTO MOREIRA, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. A Belgian-American-Brazilian configuration of jazz musicians with big ears and great songbook knowledge on, respectively, harmonica, piano, guitar and percussion. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $35 at the tables with a $15 minimum, and $20 at the bar with a one-drink minimum. RATLIFF STEVE TURRE QUINTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. The trombonist Steve Turre has knocked around jazz, Latin music, funk and all kinds of professional situations, including a long-standing place in the ''Saturday Night Live'' band; he was also an associate of the great, eccentric saxophonist Rahsaan Roland Kirk and pays tribute to him on a new record, ''The Spirits Up Above'' (Highnote). Sets tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20; there is a $10 minimum. RATLIFF Classical A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' The Metropolitan Opera can excel on occasion in making a spectacle of itself; at least the spectacle is warranted in Verdi's ''Aida,'' which was originally conceived as grand opera. Lots of different singers have wafted through this revival this season; this afternoon's cast includes Norma Fantini as Aida, Irina Mishura as Amneris and Ambrogio Maestri, who made his company debut this month, as Amonasro. When he's on, Franco Farina is a ringing Radames, and the excellent Marcello Viotti conducts. Add a few armies of dancers and horses and you could have a fine old time. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $145 to $315; returns may be available at the box office. ANNE MIDGETTE 'LA BOH\u00c9ME' The ascent of the golden-voiced Russian soprano Anna Netrebko has been so rapid that no doubt many local opera fans are yet to hear her live. This weekend provides another opportunity as she sings Musetta at the Met in Franco Zeffirelli's outsize production of this Puccini favorite. At her side will be Ruth Ann Swenson as Mimi. It's a heftier and more dramatic role for Ms. Swenson, who is better known for her beautifully nimble coloratura soprano, but she held her own last month at the first performance. Elsewhere in the cast, Peter Mattei sings an impressive Marcello, with rich, deep colors in his baritone. Frank Lopardo has replaced Marcelo Alvarez as Rodolfo. Daniel Oren conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215. JEREMY EICHLER 'TANNH\u00c4USER' At 50, the German dramatic tenor Peter Seiffert, who has a major career in Europe, has finally made his Metropolitan Opera debut in the daunting title role of Wagner's ''Tannh\u00e4user,'' a revival of Otto Schenk's handsomely realistic 1977 production. For Met fans it was worth the wait. Mr. Seiffert has all the power and stamina you could want from a Wagnerian tenor, and, rarer, true tenorial colorings and impressive vocal agility. Though he has a barrel-chested physique, he gives a charismatic, physically nimble and sympathetic portrayal of the medieval knight and song minstrel torn between the erotic pleasures of Venus and the idealized love of Elisabeth. As Elisabeth the soprano Deborah Voigt, who has shed weight and looked splendid, sings with gleaming sound and effortless power. Thomas Hampson brings the elegance of the fine German lieder singer he is to his distinguished and vocally robust portrayal of Wolfram. The mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung is a striking and vocally impassioned Venus, though she is still finding her way into the role technically. Mark Elder conducts a lithe and vividly colored performance. Tonight at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $315. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Classical Music FERRARA ENSEMBLE The valuable Music Before 1800 series is presenting this Swiss vocal and instrumental ensemble in ''Tr\u00e8s Riche Heures: Gothic Music for the Valois Dukes,'' a program of French courtly love songs from the 14th and 15th centuries. The group, directed by Crawford Young (who also plays the lute in the ensemble), is an outgrowth of a 1984 recording project at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, where it is now an ensemble in residence. Its program includes ballades, rondeaus and instrumental pieces by Machaut, Caserta, Paullet, Foliot, Vaillant and Grenon. Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Manhattan, (212) 666-9266. Tickets: $25 to $40; $20 to $35 for students and 62+. ALLAN KOZINN ANDR\u00c9 WATTS This pianist has been an uneven player in recent years, but a chamber music concert at the Metropolitan Museum last week found him in fine shape. For his recital on Sunday, Mr. Watts is performing a varied program that includes a group of Scarlatti Sonatas, Haydn's Sonata No. 58 in C, Schubert's Klavierst\u00fccke (D. 946), Debussy's ''Estampes,'' Lizst's ''Hungarian Rhapsody'' No. 13, as well as selections from ''Musica Ricercata,'' a 1951 suite by the great contemporary Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti. Sunday at 3, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $12 to $54. KOZINN Art A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 'ASIAN GAMES: THE ART OF CONTEST,' Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 327-9211, through Jan. 16. What's your game? Chess, go, pachisi, polo? These and many other recreational pursuits are saluted in a jampacked but beguiling show that pegs Asia as the continent of origin for more than a few of the sophisticated games we play today. On view are 200 games and game-related objects covering 2,000 years. They involve games of chance; memory and matching; strategy and physical skill. Elaborate boards for dice-propelled contests like pachisi, backgammon and snakes and ladders; different varieties of dice; intricately carved chessmen; lively examples of playing cards, and intriguing paraphernalia for outdoor sports like polo, are all part of this sumptuous display, enhanced by paintings, prints, sculptures and decorative accessories. A playground for the eye, even a non-gamesman's. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+. GRACE GLUECK * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+. HOLLAND COTTER * 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China; a few were unearthed as recently as last year. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. There are a few monumental sculptures; most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small, but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. It's a show that asks you to do some work, but there is so much of interest to look at that no one, even the casual drive-by viewer, will feel shortchanged. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7. COTTER * 'COMIC GROTESQUE: WIT AND MOCKERY IN GERMAN ART, 1870-1940,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 14. The horrors of World War I are usually credited with triggering the dark, often scathing humor that was used to comment on and combat some very unfunny developments in Germany in the first four decades of the century. But the Neue Galerie's splendidly multimedia revisionist show takes a broader view. It identifies paintings by Arnold B\u00f6cklin from the 1870's as a point of origin and then sweeps forward in a selective yet encompassing manner, touching on painting, poetry, graphic design and popular entertainment. It shows the influences of the satiric illustrator Thomas Theodor Heine on the mordant anti-Nazi montages of John Heartfield, and places artists like Lionel Feininger and Alfred Kubin in context. It culminates in the films of the great Karl Valentin, the star of stage, screen and cabaret who was Germany's Charlie Chaplin. Hours: Saturdays through Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7. ROBERTA SMITH 'MANNY FARBER: ABOUT FACE,' AND 'KATHARINA SIEVERDING: CLOSE UP,' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084; through Jan. 16 and Jan. 23, respectively. P.S. 1's two major fall shows are about identity defined through two different approaches to self-portraiture. Mr. Farber's show is a 40-year retrospective of work by a California artist well known as a film critic, who since the 1970's has been producing large, highly detailed still lifes. The pictures are dense with autobiographical data, from images of movie-house candy bars to handwritten notes-to-self to flowers picked fresh from the garden. The work of Ms. Sieverding of Germany could hardly be a greater visual contrast. Her series of colossal head shots suggesting film advertisements are mostly of her own face. The results are both an exercise in self-celebration, and the simultaneous creation and undermining of a personal-is-political icon. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+. COTTER 'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. This show, presenting about 40 works, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how Sargent's likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first exhibition to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show, with its catalog, is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4. GLUECK MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. There are problems with the new Museum of Modern Art, starting with its egregious $20 ticket price. The fairly inchoate assemblage of paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films from the last 30 years in the suite of double-height galleries for contemporary art on the second floor spells trouble, too. The Modern clearly still has to deal with the conflict between its historic authority when it comes to art of the first 60 or so years of the 20th century and the indeterminacy of its taste in recent art. But the building is exquisite, a great gift to the city, and you would have to be either comatose or completely immune to the pleasures of modernism not to be moved by its fifth floor, the start of the rooms for painting and sculpture. Here is the familiar, early story of modernism that the Modern virtually invented under its founding director and genius, Alfred H. Barr Jr., now retold in an installation that is about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. The mobs will inevitably congregate on that floor, so a good alternative for visitors is to explore the museum within the museum: the suites of galleries for prints, drawings, photographs and design -- mostly intimate places to peruse some of the greatest of all works of modern art. Prints provide a sublime survey of the medium up to the present. Drawings, packed in like sardines, concentrate on the period 1880 to 1945, with installations in coming months to focus on more recent eras. Photographs, skewed to the present, demonstrate how diverse that medium has become. And design is divided between two spaces, one a dense hodgepodge of objects, new and old, including chairs, pitchers, posters and automobiles, the other a mix of architectural models and drawings. With its stress on everyday objects, the design collection represents the core philosophy of the museum as it evolved in its early days: to extend modernism into the lives of ordinary people. As a 1949 museum Bulletin put it, ''Modern art is an intrinsic part of modern living.'' The new Modern, adopted already into the hearts and minds of New Yorkers, is itself the best proof how true that is. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m. KIMMELMAN 'ISAMU NOGUCHI: MASTER SCULPTOR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Aveune, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 16. In this well-planned chronicle of Noguchi's lifelong engagement with three-dimensional form, the highlight is a stunning gallery devoted to his anthropomorphic sculptures from the 1940's -- bony-looking vertical articulations that are surreal abstractions of body traits and attitudes. But the show highlights other important areas of his achievement, not least of them the products of his early days in Paris (1927-28) where he turned out a wonderful series of abstract drawings that integrate biomorphic and geometric shapes with line, signaling his embrace of modernist art. The show does not neglect his monumental pieces, which are displayed in the last gallery. Hours and admission: see above. GLUECK * 'PERSONAL AFFECTS: POWER AND POETICS IN CONTEMPORARY SOUTH AFRICAN ART,' Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700) and St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 111th Street, through Jan. 3 and Dec. 5, respectively. This two-part exhibition traces what its curators call a ''post-identity'' development in South African art since the end of apartheid, with issues of class, race and gender subsumed under other personal or abstract concerns. For the occasion, the museum commissioned new pieces from 17 artists, some specifically for the cathedral. The installation there is more than just effective. It's the strongest group show of new art anywhere in the city so far this season. But certain artists are seen to better advantage in the smaller-scale spaces of the Museum of African art itself. All in all, the show's two halves are forcefully complementary. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students and 65+. COTTER * 'PRINCELY SPLENDOR: THE DRESDEN COURT, 1580-1620,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 30. A densely baubled selection of some of the tools, armor, sculpture and bejeweled gewgaws that the princes of Dresden accumulated in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Ignore the hackneyed and pompous exhibition title and consider this a constructive reminder of the artistic roots of wonderment. Besides ivory handled hammers, a 14-piece pocketknife, silk doublets trimmed in silver and gold, a brass horn and several automatons, which move about on hidden mechanized wheels, there is a portable hunting and writing desk. It is neatly stocked with gardening tools, writing and painting implements, cupping glasses, an oil cruet, soap boxes, scales, strainers, funnels, vintner's tools, barber's instruments, farrier's tools, locksmith tools -- in sum, the world, as a mirror of divine reason, a cabinet of wonders, for princes who had everything. Hours and admission: see above. KIMMELMAN 'QUEENS INTERNATIONAL,' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, through Feb. 6. The 40 artists here are all residents of the city's most cosmopolitan borough, though nearly a third were born outside the United States. In line with current curatorial trends, overt displays of ethnicity are played down and a certain blandness prevails. But there is some interesting work, including paintings by the Japanese-American Hideo Date, now 97 and a Queens citizen for more than half a century. His two soft-grained figurative paintings from the 1930's and 40's emanate from a distant stylistic world, one that looks fine right now. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 55+. COTTER 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, through July 10. Think of cave murals and Renaissance altarpieces used to contextualize examples of modern and contemporary painting and you've got the equivalent of this exhibition, a mixed bag of old and new, quality and special pleading. Here examples of jewelry and other small objects that date back to prehistoric times lend credence to late 20th and 21st century works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Enough recent efforts stand out to make the show a valuable essay on the very notion of traditions, how they are formed, perpetuated, renewed, exploited or exhausted. But claiming to follow the beliefs or crafts of one's ancestors does not guarantee a special purchase on spirituality. All art is essentially a faith-based initiative. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Admission: $13; children, $7.50; students and 62+, $10. SMITH Galleries: Uptown BRYAN HUNT: 'AIRSHIPS,' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, through Dec. 11. Mr. Hunt became known in the mid 70's for beautiful sculptures in the form of miniature dirigibles made with balsa wood interior framing and paper skins covered with metal leaf or paint. Eight of these works, ranging in length from 40 to 64 inches, are on view here. Attached to the wall at one end, they hover mysteriously overhead. KEN JOHNSON ALFRED LESLIE: 'EXPRESSING THE ZEITGEIST,' Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through Dec. 22. Although primarily thought of today as a realist painter, Leslie started out as a second-generation Abstract Expressionist, a mover and shaker of the downtown world. This presentation of his vibrant early work from 1951 to 1962 ranges from tiny collages to large canvases, whose colors, chosen from a broad palette, were energetically laid on with heavy, loaded brushstrokes exuberantly accompanied by drips and spatter. They characteristically carry a pair or two of painted bars that punctuate the highly textured, often collaged surfaces like exclamation points. GLUECK * 'NEUE SACHLICHKEIT: NEW OBJECTIVITY IN WEIMAR GERMANY,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through Dec. 18. Heralded by the Expressionist Ludwig Meidner as a ''fanatical, fervent naturalism,'' the ostensibly realist style known as Neue Sachlichkeit was all that and more, as this uneven 80-work show vigorously suggests. It features the majestically factual photographs of August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt and Albert Renger-Patzsch, and works based on photographs by Georg Scholz, Eddy Smith and George Grosz that bring out reality's grotesque side. Carl Grossberg's pared-down, jewel-colored portrayals of German factories and villages evoke American Precisionism. SMITH A. R. PENCK: 'CONSTRUCTIONS,' Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through Dec. 18. Mr. Penck's primitivistic paintings featuring stick figures and pictographic signs became internationally visible during the triumph of German Neo-Expressionism in the 1980's. This exhibition features something different: compact, slapdash constructions mostly from the early 70's made of found objects and materials like bottles, cardboard boxes, wire, fabric, tape and newspaper. Displayed on a single table that almost fills the gallery, they create a vaguely comical theater of the absurd. JOHNSON * 'PICASSO-BECKMANN/BECKMANN-PICASSO,' Richard L. Feigen, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 31. This wonderfully illuminating exhibition brings together two great 20th-century artists who are not ordinarily closely associated. It includes significant as well as interesting minor works by both. Picasso's colorful, thickly painted late-30's picture of a bull goring a horse is worth a visit all by itself, and so is Beckmann's ''Soldier's Dream'' from 1942, a darkly comical allegory of lust and death with bird-man and bird-woman lovers. JOHNSON 'SO FAR SO CLOSE: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM GUADALAJARA,' The Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 277-8343, through Jan. 21. This five-artist exhibition is intended to show that Mexico City is not the only scene of serious contemporary art in Mexico. It includes a Delftware motorcycle helmet by Agustin Sol\u00f3rzano; gold-glazed ceramic tacos by Luis Miguel Suro; an absorbing video showing puzzling crowd behavior by Gonzalo Lebrija; Fernando Palomar's mural-scale silhouette of a Dutch landscape; and Rem Koolhass's book ''S,M,L,XL'' cut up into four different size pieces by Jos\u00e9 D\u00e1vila. JOHNSON Galleries: 57th Street WAYNE THIEBAUD, 'JUST DESSERTS,' Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331, through Dec. 18. No one did more to reanimate the tired old genre of still life painting in the last half century than did Mr. Thiebaud with his paintings of industrially regimented food products. His prints, sampled here in a 50-year retrospective, are less exciting than his paintings. Most are in black and white and on the small side. But they still convey the artist's wry vision of modern consumerism with forthright graphic efficiency, and the full-color prints of cans of paint, a row of lipsticks and a white rabbit are lovely. JOHNSON Galleries: SoHo 'THE ART OF READING,' Poets House, 72 Spring Street, (212) 431-7920, through Dec. 4 . This appropriately quiet presentation of 38 small paintings, drawings, prints and photographs of people reading includes Paul Cadmus's portrait of Glenway Wescott; David Hockney's sweet colored-pencil drawing of a young man reclining on a sofa; photographs of William S. Burroughs by Allen Ginsberg; and King Babar (the elephant) reading his newspaper at the beach in a watercolor by Laurent DeBrunhoff. JOHNSON CARMEN CICERO, June Kelly, 591 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 226-1660, through Dec. 14. Mr. Cicero's cartoonish, easel-size narrative paintings combine humor, gothic mystery and Magritte-style surrealism. In some, men in trenchcoats and fedoras walk through landscapes of dreamlike desolation or drive old cars on nocturnal country roads; in others emblematic images like a knight's helmet or a locomotive hover like mystical signs. Mr. Cicero is not an Outsider -- he has been exhibiting his art since the early 50's and earned a M.F.A. degree in 1991 -- but his work has the hair-raising feeling of a self-taught visionary's. JOHNSON GEORGE GROSZ: 'NEW YORK DRAWINGS,' Nolan/Eckman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-6190, through Dec. 4. This fascinating exhibition presents a series of ink drawings made to illustrate a 1941 collection of writings by the journalist Ben Hecht called ''1001 Afternoons in New York.'' Grosz, who moved to New York in 1933, may have done his best work during his Weimar years, but this show of never-before-exhibited drawings shows he did not leave behind his extraordinarily prehensile draftsmanship or his incisively satiric imagination. JOHNSON * 'RICHARD TUTTLE: IT'S A ROOM FOR 3 PEOPLE,' the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through Feb. 26. ''Villages'' is what Mr. Tuttle calls the five separate installations in this knotty but sparkling show of recent work. Each consists of a sculpture and two series of small drawings or paintings; no distinction is made. Each series is internally linked by a visual motif or color. The results are enchanting. They disarm aesthetic pretensions like Genius, Beauty and Greatness. They offer an adult way of seeing art and the world with a child's fresh eye. And the world according to Tuttle is a singularly rich one, minutely detailed, culturally broad, exotic and familiar, cosmopolitan and home-grown. COTTER Galleries: Chelsea SEONNA HONG: 'ANIMUS,' Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0979, through Dec. 4. This Los Angeles-based artist won an Emmy this year for her animation work on an episode of the television cartoon series ''My Life as a Teenage Robot.'' Her first solo gallery exhibition in New York presents retro-style illustrations beautifully painted on wood panels for a yet-to-be-published picture book about a little girl and a vicious black dog. JOHNSON RICHARD KERN/LILY VAN DER STOKKER, Feature, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 675-7772, through Dec. 11. These separate solo shows could be presented under the single title ''Innocence and Experience.'' Mr. Kern's voyeuristic, snapshot-style pictures of women -- staged using attractive models -- are uncommonly visceral instances of the so-called male gaze. Ms. van der Stokker's aggressively charming pastel-colored wall paintings of abstract blobs, cartoon flowers, plaid patterns and quirky texts project a childlike sweetness, wholesome family values and mischievous ironies. JOHNSON CILDO MEIRELES: 'DESCALA' AND 'STRICTU,' Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, (212) 315-0470, through Dec. 4. Concerned with changing the spectator's role from passive to active, Mr. Meireles, a Brazilian environmental artist, offers a heavy-breathing account of how spaces can be used to control mind and body. On a wooden interrogation table in a dark room is a statement condemning societal authoritarianism. The viewer is invited to don handcuffs attached to a ball and chain while viewing the second work: flat ladders and runged poles line the walls of a smaller gallery, creating a handsome compositional surround, Mondrianlike in its reductive effect. GLUECK BEATRIZ MILHAZES: 'SUMMERTIME,' James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, through Dec. 4. This Rio de Janeiro-based painter continues to produce large abstractions that teeter on the divide between the expressive and the decorative. Ms. Milhaze layers radiating blossoms, target patterns, stripes, hearts, butterflies and peace signs onto gridded patchworks of rich color. With their sensuously textured, gold leaf-accented surfaces and neo-hippie exuberance the paintings promise but don't quite deliver something really over the top. JOHNSON Other Galleries * 'AN AMERICAN ODYSSEY: 1945-1980 [DEBATING MODERNISM],' Queensborough Community College Art Gallery, 222-05 56th Avenue, Bayside, (718) 631-6396, through Jan. 13. Recently reopened after a two-year renovation, this gallery is being promoted as a showplace, and justly so: it looks spiffy and its opening show is an ambitous one that rethinks canonical accounts of American modernism. Gold-standard artists like Pollock are joined by less successful contemporaries, and Photo Realism, a movement until recently out of favor, is reconsidered. Is the show cohesive? No, but it's stimulating and fun, with some terrific underknown works by familiar artists. COTTER IAN HAMILTON FINLAY, UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 52nd Street, (212) 713-2885, through Dec. 3. Mr. Finlay, a Scottish poet, artist, gardener and rebel, born in 1925, aches for the past and feels its impact on the present. His graphic works are inspired by the French Revolution, classical art and literature, boats, World War II and his renowned garden. An expert typographer, he often fashions images from words or combinations of letters alone, placing them in punchy arrangements. Best are his images of ships, which occasionally take wry turns. Type fanciers and concrete poetry buffs will have a picnic; others may want to take along a cryptograph to fathom his buried meanings. GLUECK 'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life. COTTER 'JAMAICA FLUX: WORKSPACES AND WINDOWS,' Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, 161-04 Jamaica Avenue, Jamaica, Queens, (718) 658-7400, through Jan. 8. Although some of the work in this ambitious show is in the gallery, much is embedded in the surrounding environment, a major shopping strip. A local branch of North Fork Bank yields sculptures on the themes of wealth and illusions. Street posters adapt corporate marketing strategies to ecourage the use of libraries. The collective called Center for Urban Pedagogy planted models for urban architecture among footwear displays in Sneaker Mart Plus, and the artist Liselot van der Heijden's places a pointedly edited version of George W. Bush's 2004 State of the Union address in a shop among tapes of speeches by Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. COTTER ARCHIE RAND: 'THE 19 DIASPORA PAINTINGS,' Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, 1 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 824-2205, through Jan. 12. The mercurial Mr. Rand has created a series of canvases representing the Biblical history of Israel using imagery copied in a loose, colorful style from various sorts of adventure comic books. Each is captioned by Hebrew words of a traditional prayer. The paintings are unconvincing visually, but the effort to wed traditional religion and Postmodernist art is interesting. JOHNSON SITE, Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through Dec. 4. A cool new addition to Madison Square Park is the ''Shake Shack,'' a fast-food kiosk designed by the architecture firm Sculpture in the Environment (SITE) that was founded in 1970 by James Wines. It is partly a Postmodern hot dog stand, partly green architecture with its vegetation-covered roof and partly a way to generate revenue for the park. The small show of models and drawings at Senior & Shopmaker gives some background on Mr. Wines's inventive and admirable effort to integrate form, function and environment.
