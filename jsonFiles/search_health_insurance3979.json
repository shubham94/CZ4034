A1 Rebels Talk Softly to Old Elite Representatives of Laurent Kabila's triumphant rebel alliance, sporting cowboy hats, sought to convey to Kinshasa's elite, most of whom had ties to the deposed dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, that the country would have room for them. Reports that Mr. Mobutu and his family were encountering difficulties in finding a place to live in exile were received with glee by city residents.

A1 Suit Seeks Spying's Costs The Federation of American Scientists sued the Central Intelligence Agency to force it to reveal the size of the ''black budget,'' which finances American espionage. That budget has been reported to be about $29 billion a year, give or take a billion. President Clinton said last year that the bottom line for intelligence spending should be published. A16 C.I.A. Secrets Criticized A historian who served six years on the C.I.A.'s Historical Review Panel called the agency's promise to release cold war documents ''a carefully nurtured myth.''

A1 Welfare Plan Is Criticized Social service commissioners who oversee programs for nearly 80 percent of the state's poor told Governor Pataki in a letter that his welfare proposal would provide too little money for day care.
