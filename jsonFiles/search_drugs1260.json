Benefits consultants say some executives view the benefits as a \"gratuity\" rather than a permanent obligation, when they are not detailed in an employment contract. But most employers say they are committed to continuing the programs, albeit often with reduced benefits, despite rapid growth in both medical costs and the numbers of retirees. Under an accounting rule that takes effect in 1993, corporations with at least 500 employees must calculate future retiree medical obligations and charge off the costs against income -- either all at once, or spread over 20 years. The rule does not require setting aside cash for the future costs.", "headline": {"main": "Business and Health; Efforts to Reduce Retiree Costs"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 803, "_id": "4fd1b2b48eb7c8105d6d636b", "snippet": "PUSHED by a new accounting rule, most large employers are examining ways to reduce the enormous future costs of medical benefits they have promised to retirees.
