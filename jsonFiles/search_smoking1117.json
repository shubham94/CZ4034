Assuming some responsibility for becoming a victim was associated with more effective recovery among women who had been raped, wives who had been battered, accident victims and cancer patients. Even victims of a technological disaster, such as the radiation accident at Three Mile Island, were found to suffer less stress if they blamed themselves for some of the subsequent problems they experienced. Of course, self-blame when carried to extremes can be destructive, but the studies found that victims who have a sense of some responsibility for a crisis may also have a feeling of control. Helplessness, it seems, is one of the most destructive of all feelings after victimization.", "snippet": "CONTRARY to conventional wisdom, people who blame themselves, at least in part, for becoming the victim of a crime, accident or illness have less difficulty coping with the event, a series of recent studies shows.

The 1964 report, prepared by experts who had been approved by cigarette manufacturers, described mounting evidence that smoking contributed heavily to hundreds of thousands of deaths each year from heart disease, lung disease and cancer, particularly among men. Research has since confirmed and extended those findings, establishing links between cigarette smoking and a bone disease known as osteoporosis, heart attacks among women using birth control pills, ulcers, influenza, a dozen types of cancer, abnormalities among the unborn children of smokers and low birth weights, which characterize a large percentage of high-risk infants. The risks of smoking to women, in particular, are now all too apparent. For example, lung cancer - once the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women - this year will move to the number two slot, just behind breast cancer nationwide and ahead of it in several states. Two-thirds to three-fourths of lung cancer deaths are attributable to cigarette smoking.", "snippet": "T WENTY years ago last week, the Surgeon General of the United States shocked smokers with news of just how deadly the cigarette habit is.
