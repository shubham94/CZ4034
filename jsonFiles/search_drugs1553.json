Sperm have been extracted surgically from a man's genitalia to fertilize an egg cell from his wife, leading to a normal pregnancy. Such new approaches to infertility, as well as some still in an early experimental stage, such as mechanical insertion of male sperm into the female ovum, or egg cell, are offering new hope to couples unable to conceive children in the normal manner. According to Prof. Alan H. DeCherney of Yale University, which is beginning an embryo-freezing project, one in five couples is infertile, with the cause divided evenly between partners.

Although these procedures have been attacked on privacy grounds, such tests are well within our legal framework. All employees obviously have strong incentives to take precautionary steps against drug abuse. In addition to diminished productivity, drug-dependent employees file disproportionate numbers of worker's compensation claims and endanger the safety of others on the job. But sports employers, in particular, have an inherently stronger motivation to combat drug abuse, because athletic competition is directly dependent upon the physical and mental well-being of its participants.
