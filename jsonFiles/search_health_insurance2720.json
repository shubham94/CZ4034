You're thinking about leaving your job, but first you want to explore your company's postemployment benefits. Should you ask your boss about them? A. Until the moment you hand over your resignation letter, it's best to keep your questions as subdued as possible, said Arlene Hirsch, a career counselor in Chicago. ''Just by asking questions of this nature, you can raise suspicions about your future plans and put yourself in an uncomfortable position,'' Ms. Hirsch said. Q. Which benefits should you be concerned about? A. In addition to compensating employees for unused sick and vacation days, some companies offer departing employees options such as continuing life insurance at their own expense and the ability to transfer money from defined-benefit pensions. By law, companies are required to allow employees to transfer tax-deferred savings plans to other accounts. In many cases, employees cannot claim employer-paid matching funds on retirement accounts until they have worked long enough to be ''vested'' in the company. Lonnie Pacelli, president of Leading on the Edge, a consulting firm in Sammamish, Wash., says that vesting periods vary by company and that it pays to be aware of the requirements. Q. What about health insurance? A. Under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, employers with 20 or more employees who offer health care coverage are required to offer departing employees an opportunity to extend their health benefits. This law, known as Cobra, extends an employee's health benefits for up to 18 months beyond the last date of employment. The law says that employees have 30 days after their last day of work to request information about Cobra, and 60 more days after that to enroll. Employees must pay the premiums themselves, and premiums vary, depending on the kind of coverage your employer offers. Q. Where should you begin your search for answers? A. Terri Clark, director of human resources at the Art Institute of Las Vegas, suggests that you start with your company's employee handbook. Most companies distribute such handbooks during orientation for new employees, and update them periodically. Some companies have also put benefits information online or on corporate Intranets, she said. Generally, these supplement the handbook with links to information elsewhere, like the federal Labor Department's ''frequently asked questions'' page for Cobra, at dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq--consumer--cobra.html. Q. Should you consult former colleagues who have left the company recently? A. Sometimes the best resources are trustworthy friends. When Patrick Snow, a consultant in Bainbridge Island, Wash., decided to leave a corporate sales job in May, he called three friends to solicit advice about everything from continuing life insurance to cashing in unused vacation days. While the handbook offered general instructions for achieving these benefits, Mr. Snow's friends were able to provide him with specifics on whom to call, what to ask and how long the process would take. ''The employee handbook was good for a general overview, but it failed to answer some of my specific questions,'' said Mr. Snow, who left to start his own professional speaking business. ''Lucky for me, the information my buddies gave me enabled me to plan my exit strategy perfectly.'' Q. What are some other places to find reliable information? A. For financial expertise, particularly questions about rolling over money in a 401(k), many employees turn to accountants and financial advisers. You can also ask questions directly of insurance companies and benefits administrators, sometimes through a hot line. Sally Sidwell, senior vice president for operations at Automatic Data Processing, a company in Roseland, N.J., that provides payroll services and manages corporate benefit packages, said her organization regularly received e-mail messages and phone calls from employees of client companies with specific questions about Cobra benefits. ''A lot of times employees will call us directly with simple questions like, 'What am I going to have to pay?' or 'What does this include?''' she said. ''We understand that leaving a job is stressful, and we just try to help as best we can.'' Q. Should you ever approach your company's human resources department with your concerns? A. Human resources departments at some companies will respond gladly, even if you tell them you're thinking of leaving. But confidentiality is not required. With this in mind, Dana Law, an organizational development consultant in Bessemer, Ala., suggests corralling your curiosity, at least until you're certain you want to leave. ''Human resources professionals are there for employees, but it's also their job to worry about staffing levels,'' she said. ''If one department is running particularly short, or if a company is just looking to grow, these people have a responsibility to report any actions that seem suspicious of impending change.'' At some point, it becomes discourteous not to tell your company that you're contemplating leaving. Unveiling your plans may also work to your advantage: if some benefits are negotiable -- payment for sick days, for instance -- Ms. Law notes that it is prudent for employees to be on cordial terms at the end.", "headline": {"main": "Quitting?
