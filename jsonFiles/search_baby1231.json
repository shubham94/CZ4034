After months of name-calling, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, agrees to meet with President Reagan, presumably helping his re- election prospects. Each event occurs suddenly, without warning. Reasons and motives are seemingly obscure. In the seventh decade of dealing with the Soviet Union, it looks as if the United States is as much in the dark about that country as it was at the time of the 1917 Revolution or in 1939, when Winston Churchill labeled the Soviet Union ''a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.''", "headline": {"main": "WHAT WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT RUSSIA"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "word_count": 6047, "_id": "4fd154a78eb7c8105d6382d2", "snippet": "Leslie H.
