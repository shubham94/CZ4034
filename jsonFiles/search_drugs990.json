The ball flies out of the park, or it doesn't. But McGwire's recent admission that he has used a testosterone-boosting compound for the past year has led him and his fans into a place where uncertainties abound. The substance used by McGwire, called andro stenedione and originally developed for performance enhancement by East Germany's state-sponsored athletic drug program in the 1970's, in many ways epitomizes the new wave of performance drugs that is sweeping through the sports world, and its use underscores the ambiguities and questions that have arisen: What do these substances do?
