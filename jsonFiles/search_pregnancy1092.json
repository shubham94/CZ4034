(Riverhead, $24.95.) The newer developments of Long Island, and the optimistic (if also ambivalent and cautionary) tale of self-made American rising, provide the conditions for Lee's third novel, whose affable, ingratiating hero, Jerry Battle (descended from Battaglias), approaches his 60th birthday with a gift for affable contentment that is also his deepest flaw. THE BRONT\u00cb MYTH, by Lucasta Miller. (Knopf, $26.95.) In a book about biography as much as about the Bront\u00ebs, Miller surveys the mythification of the three brilliant bad-luck sisters on the blasted heath of Yorkshire as a growth industry, a process of romantic adoption and transformation that started while Charlotte, the last to die, was still on the scene. THE AGE OF SHAKESPEARE, by Frank Kermode. (Modern Library, $21.95.) A characteristically lucid study by a critic and scholar whose overview of Tudor politics and English Christianity serves as background to the breathtaking development of English drama from nothing much to the heights of Shakespeare in less than a generation. LITTLE CHILDREN, by Tom Perrotta. (St. Martin's, $24.95.) This novel of adultery and child-raising in a generic suburb is an outstanding contribution to the literature of Bad Mommy and Bad Daddy; its families are hothouses of boredom and everyone dreams of escape, if only to a new environment that is much the same as its predecessor. STRANGERS: Homosexual Love in the Nineteenth Century, by Graham Robb. (Norton, $26.95.) A brilliant work of social archaeology by a writer who comes to gay history by way of writing the lives of Rimbaud and Balzac; he has discovered that there were plenty of gay people way back when, that everybody knew this and that attitudes were not radically different from what they are now, though the criminal penalties could be a lot more severe. THE LUCKY ONES, by Rachel Cusk. (Fourth Estate/HarperCollins, $24.95.) Five loosely linked narratives purporting to be a novel, by an English writer; the first story is a brutal account of a convict in the last stages of pregnancy, and the long concluding pair devastate the reader with characters nobody could love and marriages nobody should have entered into. DOT IN THE UNIVERSE, by Lucy Ellmann. (Bloomsbury, paper, $13.95.) A cheerfully subversive novel whose heroine, Dot, an inconspicuous wifey in an English seaside town, acquires a taste for blood in an accident and takes to wiping folk out, including herself; after a spell in hell, she is reborn to an American family, but retains, for social observation and comment, all her British powers of snideness. DANCING WITH CUBA: A Memoir of the Revolution, by Alma Guillermoprieto. (Pantheon, $25.) In 1969 the author, then a 20-year-old Merce Cunningham dance student, took a teaching job in Cuba. She and Cuba did not get on; she found homosexual artists more appealing than Castro's officials. She became not a dancer but a splendid reporter, and this book is a sagaciously observed view of her memories.", "headline": {"main": "And Bear In Mind"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "word_count": 496, "_id": "4fd239c08eb7c8105d7cdcae", "snippet": "(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)    ALOFT, by Chang-rae Lee.
