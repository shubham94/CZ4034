As a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, I played a significant role at McLean in that era, and I was involved in the treatment of some of the people mentioned. McLean was not, as the book apparently depicts, a kind of five-star hotel catering to the whims of affluent people. A large proportion of the patient population was composed of middle-class individuals subsidized by a health insurance system that was far more beneficent in its attitude toward mental illness than it is today. I was chairman of the committee that often granted substantial rate reductions to people who were short on funds. The wards were more like seedy college dormitories than hotels, and those patients who were well enough to leave the ward ate in a relatively unattractive cafeteria. What is most important, however, is the absurdity of the implication that highly accomplished people who are not seriously disturbed would choose to vacation in a mental hospital, or that what was done to them in the guise of treatment was thoughtless and often harmful. In numerous instances the excellent treatment the hospital afforded seriously disturbed individuals, by thoughtful, dedicated clinicians, ''cured'' or significantly ameliorated their illnesses so that they were able to leave the hospital and lead the kind of constructive and creative lives that subsequently gained them public recognition.
