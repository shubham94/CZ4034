After a series of neurological tests, doctors at the University of Minnesota concluded that he had multiple sclerosis. Despite periodic flare-ups that sometimes required hospitalization, Ronald managed to complete a college degree in psychology and develop expertise as a social worker. He met a fellow student who became his wife and mother of their three sons. Ronald, now 52 years old, still works full time, drives a car and gets about on his own, though he uses a cane because his gait is sometimes unsteady. Despite the slow progression of his stillincurable illness, he always has a smile and a good word for family and friends. His indomitable spirit, his friends say, helped him to surmount the limitations of the disease and to lead a full and useful life. Luck was also on his side, for he is among a large minority of multiple sclerosis patients whose disease has followed a relatively benign course. Others fare even better than he: About 25 percent of victims never develop progressively disabling symptoms even though they have occasional flare-ups; in a few patients the disease becomes inactive indefinitely even without treatment. The typical patient today can look forward to a near-normal life expectancy, usually with recurrent attacks interspersed with periods of remission that may last a year or longer.", "snippet": "RONALD was an 18-year-old high-school graduate when he noticed the peculiar symptoms: a spasm in one heel and paralysis of the left cheek.
