As a technical matter, the ruling is binding on only that one company. But the ruling -- the first time a court has addressed the issue of gender equity in drug coverage -- sets a legally solid precedent that may well encourage more health coverage of contraceptives nationwide. The issue caught fire a few years ago after it was discovered that many employers who excluded women's prescription contraceptives from coverage chose to pay for Viagra, the prescription drug to treat impotence in men. The class action suit, brought under the pregnancy discrimination provisions of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, challenged an obvious inequity -- the fact that the health insurance coverage offered by the chain paid for all the basic health care needs of male employees while selectively excluding the cost of birth-control pills or other forms of contraception. Judge Robert S. Lasnik found that Congress, in amending Title VII in 1978 to bar pregnancy discrimination, intended to outlaw any discrimination against women ''in the terms and conditions of their employment, including the benefits an employer provides to its employees.'' He added that men and women had different health care needs and that ''the law is no longer blind to the fact that only women can get pregnant, bear children, or use prescription contraception.''", "headline": {"main": "A Win for Contraception"}, "abstract": "Editorial welcomes ruling by Judge Robert S Lasnik of federal court in Washington State that local family-owned drugstore chain engaged in unlawful sex discrimination by excluding contraceptive coverage from its employee health plan; hopes this encourages opposition to Bush administration's attempt to end contraceptive coverage for federal employees, and affects New York State, where bill that would require Catholic hospitals and schools to provide female employees insurance coverage for contraceptives is stalled because of strong opposition from Cardinal Edward Egan", "print_page": "14", "word_count": 351, "_id": "4fd258788eb7c8105d80410c", "snippet": "A federal trial judge in Washington State ruled this week that a local family-owned drugstore chain had engaged in unlawful sex discrimination by excluding contraceptive coverage from its employee health plan.

Directed by Luke Greenfield (PG-13, 83 minutes). The goofy new Rob Schneider comedy isn't the gross-out farce that its title suggests. The star portrays a meek, much-persecuted police department file clerk who, after being implanted with animal organs after a near-fatal car accident, fights against the instincts of the donor beasts that rise up inside him. Especially when he goes into a mating dance with a female goat and feeds a bird (bird-style) in an animal shelter, this fable about the dog beneath the skin is very funny.
