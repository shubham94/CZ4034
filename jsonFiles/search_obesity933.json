The scientist, Dr. Richard Wurtman, director of the Clinical Research Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that his investigation into Redux had led him to believe that phentermine, a prescription diet drug that was taken with Redux but is still on the market, might be unsafe if taken together with the antidepressant Prozac or similar drugs. This risk, he said, might also exist with some over-the-counter cold medicines and weight-loss pills.", "snippet": "A scientist who helped to develop Redux, one of two weight-loss drugs taken off the market in 1997 after they were linked to heart damage, is now suggesting that the problems were not due to Redux alone, but rather to its being combined with other...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "WURTMAN, RICHARD", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "HEART", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "WEIGHT", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "DIETING", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "REDUX (DRUG)", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "PHENTERMINE (DRUG)", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "2", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 1022, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
