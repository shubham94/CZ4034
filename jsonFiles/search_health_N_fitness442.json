Strend is an acronym derived from the first three letters of ''strength'' and ''endurance.'' Each Strend competition includes five upper-body strength events -- bench presses, pull-ups, military presses, chin-ups and bar dips followed by a three-mile run. The first Strend contest in 1992 was little more than a group workout. There are now four to six events a year in several United States cities and throughout Germany.
