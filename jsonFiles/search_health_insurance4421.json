You say that this \"innocent-sounding\" provision would undermine cost and quality controls. The truth is that these provisions are essential to protect quality of care. You assume insurance companies are interested in providing cost-effective, good-quality care. My experience as a practicing psychologist tells me otherwise. Insurance companies are indeed motivated to minimize costs (that is, benefits paid out) -- this increases profits. But they have no incentive to maximize quality -- that often costs money. The result is that they often exclude highly trained and experienced providers who they think may prescribe more expensive treatment, and allow in mediocre practitioners who they think will be more compliant with the company's wish to save money. Similarly, \"medical necessity,\" the standard by which the companies determine whether to pay for treatment, is generally defined in a highly restrictive and self-serving way. In mental health treatment, the area with which I am familiar, brief, inexpensive and inadequate treatment is often all that is approved, when more extensive treatment is necessary.", "headline": {"main": "Managed Care Is Supermarket Medicine; Doctors' Ethical Bind"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": 406, "_id": "4fd1e2d28eb7c8105d72bbb9", "snippet": "To the Editor:   The editorial \"Sneak Attack on Health Reform\" (April 11) attacks \"any willing provider\" provisions in health care plans, under which any provider willing to accept a plan's fees and standards must be accepted by the insurance plan....", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/opinion/l-managed-care-is-supermarket-medicine-doctors-ethical-bind-875511.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "FRANKEL, JAY B"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEALTH INSURANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOCTORS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1994-04-23T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Financial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "The Unisys Corporation and lawyers representing retired company employees said today that they had reached a $111 million tentative settlement that partly resolves class-action lawsuits over a termination in health benefits.
