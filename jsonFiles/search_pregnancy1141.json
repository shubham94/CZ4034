A manager at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re asked Margaret Kelly to put together a new troupe of her famous British dancing girls, the Bluebells. As for Kelly herself -- Miss Bluebell, she was called -- the manager suggested she refrain from appearing at the theater. Kelly's husband was Jewish, and with the invasion of the Germans looking imminent, the theater wasn't willing to risk its reputation, Kelly was told. Within six months, the Germans had overrun Paris and Kelly's husband had fled, eventually returning to a hidden life in an apartment on the Left Bank. Although many of the nightclubs went dark, for most of her husband's two-and-a-half-year seclusion, Kelly kept directing a small line of dancers at a modest dance hall. Kelly made the most of the sequins and feathered caps and food-rationed girls she could get her hands on, creating a show for an audience seeking denial or defiance, conjuring the vestiges of glamour from a city that reeked, at the time, of defeat and deprivation, of humiliation, even of hunger. Every week, Kelly got on her bicycle, pedaled west, up the inclined slope of the city, to reach a man who could sell her vegetables. The basket on her bike full, she headed back toward her husband's secret home across the Seine. She brought him magazines, stationery, his mended clothing. She brought him herself, her devotion, unperturbed by the risks she was taking, all of them punishable by death. She was six months pregnant when the Gestapo called her in the first time to interrogate her about her husband, whom they knew had been missing for considerably longer than her condition would suggest -- a high-risk pregnancy, indeed. After each interrogation, she'd bike home and expunge the house, in a panic, of any hint of her husband, the men's briefs fresh from the wash, the clean undershirts.

Premenstrual migraines thrummed in her skull. In her mid-20's, she was a chiropodist in London. In 1942, she became pregnant with her first son. Some of us muddle our way through those nine months. Dalton felt fine. Now that she was high on hormones and packed with progesterone, the migraines that had plagued her since she was an adolescent went away. Pregnancy shapes the social and emotional lives of many women, though rarely does it help define a career. But it prompted Dalton to wonder what exactly was the connection between those sex steroids we call hormones and that omnipotent invisibility we call mood. She came to believe that pregnancy -- during which progesterone levels are sky high -- was a time of serenity. It made sense, then, that the misery preceding some women's periods might be the result of inadequate progesterone production. She went back to school for medicine, a lifelong dream. In her first months as a general practitioner, she identified and treated patients with premenstrually related asthma, epilepsy and migraines by dosing them with progesterone. She had taken it herself, too, after Dr. Raymond Greene, a colleague, recommended the treatment.", "headline": {"main": "Katharina Dalton [ b. 1916 ]; The Prophet of PMS", "kicker": "Katherina Dalton, b. 1916"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "34", "word_count": 820, "_id": "4fd254e88eb7c8105d7fd079", "snippet": "By naming an affliction, she helped liberate women from its pain.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/26/magazine/26DALTON.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "WOMEN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Lauren", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Slater"}], "original": "By Lauren Slater"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2004-12-26T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Magazine"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Diabetes killed an increasing number of New York City residents last year, ranking for the first time among the five leading causes of death in an annual summary of vital statistics released yesterday by the health department.
