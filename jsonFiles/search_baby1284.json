The study, conducted by the General Motors Research Laboratories at Warren, Mich., was based on detailed ground and satellite tracking of three haze episodes in the summer of 1979. The scientists found that all three episodes ''originated in the Northeast and Midwest, traveled in a large circular path to the Gulf of Mexico and then returned northeastward.'' The primary sources of the hazes were sulfates and ozone precursors from industrial emissions. The particulates were found to remain in the air several days, in the absence of precipitation. In two cases, the haze moved clockwise, from the Middle West and Northeast down to the Gulf Coast and back. The counterclockwise exception was a result of Hurricane David.", "headline": {"main": "The Haze Comes Home", "kicker": "SCIENCE WATCH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 669, "_id": "4fd10cda8eb7c8105d5c0ac3", "snippet": "Those summertime hazes that come north from the Gulf of Mexico on the strength of tropical air masses are in many cases bringing air pollutants back to their places of origin, according to a study published in the current issue of the journal...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/10/science/science-watch-the-haze-comes-home.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "HORMONES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WEATHER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ASTRONAUTICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HAZARDOUS MATERIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TESTS AND TESTING"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1981-02-10T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Science; Health"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 60}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
