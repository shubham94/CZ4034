Few people, even lawmakers, realize that federal law does not mandate that any doctor, hospital, laboratory, city or state report human diseases directly to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, our nation's medical counterpart to the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security wrapped into one. And that applies to diseases as potentially devastating as avian flu. Instead the C.D.C. relies on a voluntary surveillance system that varies across 50 states and territories. Here's how it works. Doctors and laboratories report certain infectious diseases judged to be important for public health to local health authorities or state epidemiologists. Subsequently, the states send reports to the federal government, some electronically, some through the mail. The list of diseases required to be reported is typically written into state law. Over time, the typical list has grown from tuberculosis and syphilis to more than 50 diseases, including those caused by salmonella and certain antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.
