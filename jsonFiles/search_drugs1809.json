Seven years ago, two medical scientists elucidated how this defect endangers its victims and how the body's cells use cholesterol. Now, they are studying promising new treatments that may have general application, preventing heart disease by drastically lowering blood cholesterol levels. The doctors, Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein of the University of Texas Health Sciences Center here, are known locally as ''the gold dust twins'' for the many prizes and generous private support their work has drawn. Their investigations revealed that some people are born with an error in the signaling system that regulates cholesterol production within the body. The result - an overabundance of cholesterol in the blood - renders such persons highly susceptible to clogging of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and an early death from heart disease. It is the most common potentially lethal human genetic defect yet identified.", "headline": {"main": "FATAL GENETIC FLAW OFFERS 'HUMAN LAB' TO TEST THEORIES ON CHOLESTEROL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1696, "_id": "4fd117dc8eb7c8105d5cf9b6", "snippet": "DALLAS CHOLESTEROL, a vital substance but a lethal one when it gets in the wrong places, is never more deadly than in people born with a genetic defect that dooms them to an early death from heart disease.

The program, once scheduled to take effect in May, would have required dispensing information leaflets, called ''patient package inserts,'' with the 10 most widely prescribed drugs.
