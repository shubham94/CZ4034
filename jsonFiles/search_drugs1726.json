A spokesman for the Federal agency, Bill Grigg, said letters were sent out Friday to 350 manufacturers and distributors of the substances, warning that it is illegal to continue to market over-the-counter stimulants with any active ingredient other than the caffeine found in legitimate ''wake-up'' pills. According to the Federal agency, the new rules have affected a few legitimate manufacturers of diet pills who used caffeine in their products along with the appetite suppressant phenylpropanomaline and a nasal decongestant. The agency said those companies would have to drop the caffeine. Mr. Grigg said many of them had already done so voluntarily, because the caffeine added nothing to help dieters.", "headline": {"main": "F.D.A.
