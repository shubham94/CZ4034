By David Marc. (University of Pennsylvani\u00b8 evisa, Cloth, $22.50. Paper, $9.95.) In what is probably the most spirited defense of American television ever written, David Marc, who teaches American civilization at Brown University, writes, ''The self-proclaimed champions of 'high art' who dismiss TV shows as barren imitations of the real article simply do not know how to watch.'' The way to watch, he says, is with irony, a fan's knowledge of television history and an awareness that commercial television, like it or not, is our cultural currency. However gross the aims of the industry, he writes, ''it is ludicrous to crucify 'Sgt. Bilko' for the sins of General Sarnoff.'' Television, he maintains, is (always?) funny. As if accepting a dare, he puckishly finds a golden age not in Chayefskyan live drama, not in Norman Lear's high-minded situation comedies, but in ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' of the '' auteur '' Paul Henning. Mr. Marc rhapsodizes more persuasively about Jackie Gleason's career, but when he celebrates police shows as comedies, he forces the point, perhaps because he doesn't realize most viewers don't watch with the irony he recommends. Against ''doomsday critics,'' he usefully reminds us that viewers are also de facto critics and television shows are worth analyzing. He wants to find ''artful uses for this cultural heritage'' and finds it in the heydays of ''Saturday Night Live,'' ''Second City Television'' and chatty comedy-variety.
