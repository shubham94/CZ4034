The smokers and lovers can trace their new status to Thomas Jefferson's manifesto, in particular the four-word phrase that rounded out his list of inalienable rights. As participants in what we have come to call the culture wars, they are the losers and winners of the pursuit of happiness. For more than two centuries, Jefferson's phrase has hovered over this fractious churning, drawing in as many combatants as there are notions of happiness. While most Americans can agree on definitions of life and liberty, the Declaration's first two inalienable rights, happiness is another matter. In a nation of immigrants and strivers, dropouts and resisters, sectarians and self-help gurus, Jefferson left behind an endlessly mutating set of fighting words. What he left vague, generations have vied to spell out, by force of law or just by force.", "headline": {"main": "The Nation; Pursuing Happiness, Jefferson To J.Lo"}, "abstract": "Article on Independence Day focuses on battle to spell out pursuit of happiness, vague right established in Declaration of Independence; pursuit underlies two enduring strains of American unhappiness: culture wars and ravenous consumer culture; drawing (M)", "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1488, "_id": "4fd22a0b8eb7c8105d7b439d", "snippet": "THIS week, as Americans celebrate the 227th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, smokers in New York will huddle outside once smoky bars, prevented by a new law from lighting up inside, and lovers in Texas will go home disencumbered of the...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/29/weekinreview/the-nation-pursuing-happiness-jefferson-to-jlo.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "INDEPENDENCE DAY (US) (JULY 4)"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "John", "lastname": "LELAND"}], "original": "By JOHN LELAND"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2003-06-29T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Week in Review"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Most people will never take an I.Q. test, and if they do, it probably won't have a big impact on them. Generally speaking, I.Q. tests do not carry much weight anymore. Not with vague charges of cultural bias still clinging to them. Not at a time when multiple intelligences -- that happy, inclusive vision in which nearly everybody is good at something -- are on the ascendancy. If you do take a Stanford-Binet or a Wechsler, and you score in the average range, well, there you'll be, with hardly a reason to mention it. If you score high, the particular number won't matter much -- unless you're the sort to join Mensa, and then it will matter only to your fellow Mensa members. But if you are in the bottom 3 percent of the population that scores 70 or lower, your actual I.Q. number will mean a great deal. Scores in that range will most likely lead to a diagnosis of mental retardation, and that diagnosis will entail many things, starting with mandated special education. Since last June, across the United States, it has also entailed exemption from capital punishment. And so, for someone who has committed a capital crime, an I.Q. score can mean the difference, quite literally, between life and death. It can mean, if we want to be blunt about it, that there is such a thing as being too dumb to die, at least at the hands of the state. On June 20, 2002, when the Supreme Court issued a decision declaring execution of the retarded unconstitutional, it surprised even some of the very people who had been working hardest to make that day come about. Asked to rule on the same question in 1989, the justices had reached the opposite conclusion, declaring that while evidence of a defendant's mental retardation ought to be presented as a mitigating factor at sentencing, it did not render him or her ineligible for the death penalty. Now here they were just 13 years later -- not so long in the history of what the court called our ''evolving standards of decency'' -- saying that the world had changed, that Americans were no longer willing to countenance the ultimate punishment for people who by definition could never be as morally culpable as other adults.", "headline": {"main": "The Executioner's I.Q.
