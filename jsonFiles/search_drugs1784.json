Rennie, a former aircraft pilot with a history of mental illness, was questioned by Secret Service agents after he allegedly threatened to kill President Gerald R. Ford. The incident resulted in his involuntary commitment to the Ancora Psychiatric Hospital, a state institution in Hammonton, N.J. Today Mr. Rennie, who is 40 years old, is at the center of a legal battle over medication practices of psychiatrists that some experts say will have to be resolved by the United States Supreme Court. The outcome is expected to have a significant effect on the care of the 220,000 patients in the nation's mental hospitals. An emerging right of mental patients to refuse antipsychotic medication has been recognized so far by Federal courts in Massachusetts and Ohio, by the highest state courts in Colorado and Oklahoma, and, in Mr. Rennie's case, by Judge Stanley S. Brotman of the Federal District Court in Camden, N.J. Judge Brotman imposed far-reaching restrictions, which have been in effect since January 1980, on the medication practices of New Jersey's five state mental hospitals for adults. The state is asking the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, to overturn the restrictions, calling them ''complex and highly intrusive, unprecedented and unsound.''", "headline": {"main": "MENTAL PATIENTS' RIGHT TO REFUSE MEDICATION IS CONTESTED IN JERSEY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1358, "_id": "4fd121ce8eb7c8105d5e3c1b", "snippet": "In 1974, John E.

Veterans who are black or members of other minority groups were found to be strikingly disadvantaged in postwar schooling, careers and earning power, and with most veterans now in their mid-30's, the study concluded that most career setbacks may be irrevocable.
