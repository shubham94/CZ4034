From high-speed drills to X-rays, the men and women who pull and preserve teeth have often turned to technology to take their practice one more step beyond the image of the torture chamber. It's no surprise then, that dentists are going digital. Patients will still have to open wide, of course, to have cavities filled and teeth removed. Some things never change. But X-ray film may one day be replaced by a wafer-size sensor that electronically generates an X-ray image on a chair-side monitor. The dental mirror may be replaced, or at least augmented, by a slender fiber-optic tool that uses a miniature video camera to show incipient trouble spots. And along with the fiber-optic wand may come a range of computerized devices that inject Novocain, check the health of the gums and even analyze the bite -- no more chomping and grinding the teeth on squares of black paper.", "headline": {"main": "Overbite, Underbite, Megabyte: Dentistry Gets an Upgrade"}, "abstract": "High-technology dental equipment offers promise of faster treatments, less exposure to X-rays and less pain; some dentists resist digital gadgets, questioning their cost and value; many are using computers for small jobs; photo (M)", "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1782, "_id": "4fd20b2c8eb7c8105d77970a", "snippet": "TECHNOLOGY has always been the dentist's stock in trade.
