The problems, while irksome, can be remedied later. It would have been a better plan if it had been drawn up by people who believed in government-supported health care and were actually willing to forgo other initiatives (like tax cuts) in order to pay for it. Instead, the Republican-controlled Congress produced an oddly shaped program whose most salient feature has been dubbed the ''doughnut hole.'' All beneficiaries have their initial drug purchases covered (except for deductibles and co-payments) up to a specified limit. Then anyone with higher bills falls into the ''doughnut hole,'' where there is no coverage and the beneficiary pays the full cost until reaching $3,600 out of pocket, at which point catastrophic coverage kicks in and pays most of the bill.", "headline": {"main": "A Good but Puzzling Drug Benefit", "kicker": "Editorial"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "word_count": 738, "_id": "4fd25f868eb7c8105d80f9ba", "snippet": "Medicare's new prescription drug program is an important new benefit and its problems, while irksome, can be remedied later.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/opinion/27sun1.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICARE"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-11-27T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Letter", "blog": [], "news_desk": "The City Weekly Desk", "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: Re ''At Age 128, Looks Still Matter'' (Nov. 20), about the Jefferson Market Library in Greenwich Village: In 1946 the Jefferson Market Courthouse was used as the first central office of Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York.
