However, that he disagrees with the (uncertain) results of an (incomplete) study of vitamin supplements in Finland does not justify his dragging quinoline yellow dye into the argument. By reading the \"fine print\" in the article in The New England Journal of Medicine, he learns that the vitamins that were given in the study were colored with quinoline yellow.

So on Friday's surprising report that unemployment fell to 6.4 percent and 267,000 payroll jobs were added in April (to top it off, without the truckers' strike that would have been 73,000 higher), the stock and bond markets went into mourning.
