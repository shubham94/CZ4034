But dozens of studies involving more than a million people have hailed such a drug. It is none other than ordinary aspirin, the standby for reducing pain, fever and inflammation. The findings of recent studies strongly suggest that an aspirin a day -- or at least every other day -- may be better than an apple at keeping the doctor away. Aspirin, these studies indicate, can reduce a person's chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke and of developing cancers of the colon and other digestive organs. It may also improve brain function in people with dementia who have suffered little strokes, ward off or reduce the severity of migraine headaches and help prevent hazardous high blood pressure in pregnant women.

Until this view of the cause of ulcers was endorsed this month by an independent panel of medical experts convened by the National Institutes of Health, a Federal agency in Bethesda, Md., the theory and benefits of antimicrobial therapy were still considered unproved and radical.
