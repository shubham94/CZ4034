SNIDER -->SNIDER--Arnold H. III, passed away Friday, January 3rd after a short but courageous battle with cancer. Arnie was 68 years old. Arnie was a loving husband, father and grandfather who not only achieved great success in his career on Wall Street, but was also a dedicated and tireless philanthropist. Arnie began his career as a financial analyst specializing in pharmaceuticals at Kidder Peabody. During his seventeen years at Kidder, he established and led a recognized team of health care analysts, served as Head of the Healthcare Research Group as Managing Director, and as Chairman of the Stock Selection Committee. He was considered a highly successful analyst and \"stock picker\", who was selected to the Institutional Investor All-America Research Team in 1986 and 1987. He was also ranked as the leading pharmaceutical industry analyst by the Greenwich Research Poll. Arnie moved to the field of asset management in 1988 when he joined Tiger Management, bringing his business acumen and deep knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry to his oversight of the firm's global healthcare investments. In 1993, he founded Deerfield Management Company, which specialized in healthcare equities, and served as Deerfield's Managing Partner until he formally retired in 2005. During retirement, he utilized his business and financial skills to successfully advise on a number of important business and charitable projects. He served as a Chairman of the Board of N30, a small, privately owned pharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel drugs in diseases which currently have no cure. He also served as a trustee and as the Chairman of the Investment Committee for the Davidson College endowment, his alma mater where he was a champion of The Davidson Trust, committed to making Davidson accessible to all talented students regardless of their financial circumstances. While a Trustee, he created the Arnold H. Snider Scholarship, which provides full scholarships for two students in each class. As important as Arnie's professional accomplishments were, he was equally committed to a number of philanthropic endeavors. Arnie's expansive knowledge of the healthcare industry and drug development provided a foundation for his philanthropic efforts in a number of areas of medical and scientific research, including geriatric medicine, spinal cord injuries, and lupus. Along with his wife, Katherine, he endowed the Kate Mills Snider Geropsychiatry Outreach Program and Professorship Fund within the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. They also established the Arnold and Katherine Snider Geriatric Fund at Princeton Hospital. Arnie also served as the Vice Chairman, Board of Directors, for the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation and as Chairman of the Foundation's Research Planning Committee. In 2000, Arnie and his wife established Rheuminations, Inc. a foundation to support lupus research and develop educational programs for patients with lupus, through which they created The Mary Kirkland Center for Lupus Research at the Hospital for Special Surgery, a related Kirkland Scholar Program that has provided research grants to individual lupus investigators at academic institutions in the US and Canada, and an educational website for lupus patients. In 2003, they founded the Lupus Clinical Trials Consortium, Inc. to support the development of new therapies for lupus, which evolved into a multi-center lupus patient data base registry intended to support lupus research and related publications. Arnie received his BA from Davidson College and an MBA from the University of Virginia School of Business. Arnie was an avid reader of politics and history, and was devoted to classical music and to golf. He was a gentle, kind and generous person whose friendships were defined by warmth and loyalty. Arnie deeply loved and took immense pride in his family. He is survived by his wife, Katherine, daughter, Sarah Kirkland Snider Mackey, son, Ned Snider, son-in-law, Steven Mackey, daughter-in-law Marina Greenstein Snider, three grandchildren, Jasper and Dylan Mackey and Simone Snider; his brother, Lewis Brittle Snider of McLean Virginia, and a nephew, Britt Arnold Snider of Chevy Chase, VA. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Arnie's memory may be made to any of the following charities: Arnold H.
