This is understandable enough: the realities of a disease like schizophrenia are so harrowing, and its effects on its victims and the people close to them so devastating, that we are eager for deeper meanings and happy endings. But if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness, we also need movies like Tim McCann's ''Revolution No. 9,'' an unadorned, unsparing chronicle of a young man's descent into a nightmare of delusion, paranoia and self-destructive behavior. Jackson (Michael Risley) is a 27-year-old New Yorker (originally from the Midwest) working at a dot-com and newly engaged to Kim (Adrienne Shelly). Jackson's offbeat, deadpan sense of humor and air of distracted intensity make the early signs of his incipient illness hard to detect. After accusing some co-workers of rearranging objects on his desk, he becomes convinced that he is being harassed by a conspiracy of disparate forces and individuals trying to control his mind and steal his identity. He suspects Kim's young nephew, a would-be hacker, of involvement and tracks down the director of a perfume commercial that he thinks is a linchpin of the plot.", "headline": {"main": "Portraying Severe Mental Illness Without Romanticizing It", "kicker": "FILM REVIEW"}, "abstract": "A O Scott reviews movie Revolution No 9, directed by Tim McCann (S)", "print_page": "23", "word_count": 697, "_id": "4fd26b298eb7c8105d822f10", "snippet": "From ''King of Hearts'' to ''A Beautiful Mind,'' many of the most widely embraced movie treatments of severe mental illness have been marked by romanticism and sentimentality.
