Gil Burnett, a retired trial judge from New Hanover County, N.C., thinks it's worth a try. Frustrated by 23 years of punishing crimes whose ''root cause,'' he says, was unwanted pregnancy, Burnett is pushing a plan called Project for Happier Lives, which would entice young women to stay un-pregnant through cash sweepstakes. Under it, any girl age 10 to 19 could enroll in three years of monthly classes in money management, career planning and (the crux) saying no to sexual advances, a subject Burnett has dubbed ''Games Guys Play 101.'' For staying un-pregnant, each girl would get the chance to win monthly drawings of $25 gifts (for hairdos and the like) and a $5,000 grand prize at the end of the year. Though the community has agreed that the program makes sense, there has been pointed opposition to the idea that society can buy good behavior. Burnett, who characterizes himself as a die-hard realist, argues that the plan is an unusual but reasonable technique for a county that had 200 teen-age pregnancies in 1996. At the moment, the county commission has stalled on whether to allow the health department to offer official support, but Burnett is steaming ahead with more than $15,000 in private financing and a vision of the project being replicated nationwide. Meanwhile, Burnett's supporters are not moved by the argument that purchased virtue is a vice.", "headline": {"main": "Say No . . . and Win!", "kicker": "SUNDAY: JANUARY 11, 1998: SEX"}, "abstract": "Gil Burnett, retired North Carolina judge, is pushing plan to encourage young women not to get pregnant by offering prizes in monthly cash sweepstakes; drawing (S)", "print_page": "13", "word_count": 310, "_id": "4fd1f7278eb7c8105d751f7a", "snippet": "Can free manicures and the lure of cold cash keep teen-age girls from getting pregnant?
