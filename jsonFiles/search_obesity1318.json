The women in the class are dressed like most fashion-conscious fitness buffs: shimmery leotards, tights, leg warmers or plush sweat suits. But unlike those who work out at other clubs around the city, these face away from the mirrored walls for they prefer not to see themselves exercising. There are no size 9's and the chances are poor that there ever will be. The majority of the women who belong to the Greater Woman, an exercise studio that opened on East 89th Street last week, are all significantly overweight - not the proverbial 5 or 10 pounds from their weight goals. One of the lightest members of the class is at about 155 but is only about 5 feet tall. The heaviest is several inches taller and weighs just under 300.", "snippet": "The exercise classes are conducted like many others: warm-up stretches, aerobic exercises and cool-down movements.
