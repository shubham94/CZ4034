The tactic, described by Gardiner Harris in a recent Times article, involves frightening patients into believing that a stingy Medicare program will make it impossible for oncologists to provide chemotherapy in the comfortable surroundings of easy-to-reach offices, thus forcing them to transfer the patients to less convenient hospitals for treatment. The American Society of Clinical Oncology, the nation's largest professional society of cancer doctors, wisely distanced itself from such scare tactics in a letter published in Thursday's Times. The letter stated that ''the society does not support any campaign that plays on the fears of patients or exploits them for political purposes or any other reason.'' The current controversy comes after years in which Medicare greatly overpaid cancer doctors for the drugs they use while underpaying them for administering chemotherapy in the office, a complex task that requires highly trained staff and sophisticated equipment. It's not clear how much of that large overpayment for drugs was used by oncologists to subsidize the undercompensated services and how much contributed to incomes exceeding $300,000 for oncologists in 2002.", "headline": {"main": "Cancer Scare Tactics"}, "abstract": "Editorial calls for oncologists to refrain from using scare tactics with patients and patient advocacy groups in effort to get more money from Medicare; says controversy comes after years in which Medicare overpaid doctors for drugs they use while underpaying them for administering outpatient chemotherapy, allocation which is being reversed; says doctors will have opportunity after new fees are formally proposed to seek redress", "print_page": "22", "word_count": 374, "_id": "4fd239c08eb7c8105d7cdc4b", "snippet": "Angry cancer doctors are trying to stampede their patients and patient advocacy groups into supporting their demands for more money from Medicare next year.
