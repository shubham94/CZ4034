The courier disappears into the building with one or two large gray containers and drops them off at a small company called Advanced Cell Technology. The gray cases look like toolboxes, but they are actually sophisticated shipping containers, commonly used for transporting materials used in animal-breeding work, and they contain the starting material for a series of experiments that may completely rewrite the tables of human longevity. Or they may be remembered only for being among the most ethically troubling scientific endeavors of our times. Inside the gray cases are hundreds of cow eggs -- big, plump and beautifully rotund oocytes, as they're technically known -- each one painstakingly plucked the day before from the ovaries of cows slaughtered in Iowa. They are doused with a marinade of enzymes that prime them for imminent fertilization and then sealed in small plastic test tubes before being shipped overnight to Worcester. On the drizzly, overcast day in mid-December when I visited the laboratories at Advanced Cell, the shipment of eggs arrived a little before me. In all the time that cows have roamed the planet, their oocytes have never encountered the insults they were about to face that day. The eggs would be stripped of their DNA, deliberately fused with human cells and fooled into thinking that fertilization had occurred, in the fervent commercial hope that some sort of an embryo might result.", "headline": {"main": "The Recycled Generation"}, "abstract": "Stephen S Hall article on the promise of stem-cell research to create a self-generated and limitless supply of transplant tissue with which to treat disease and injury and halt the aging process; notes that since human-stem cells cannot now be obtained without destroying a human embryo, the right-to-life debate profoundly affects that scientific, commerical and ethical landscapes that intersect with stem cells; focuses on research at Geron Corp and and Advanced Cell Technology under leadership of Michael West; also considers those aspects of immortalizing medicine that make it a bad idea to many thoughtful people; photos (L)", "print_page": "30", "word_count": 7268, "_id": "4fd233c58eb7c8105d7c4749", "snippet": "Almost every weekday morning, usually before 10:30, an overnight delivery truck with an unusual cargo negotiates the hilly streets on the outskirts of Worcester, Mass., and comes to a halt in front of a brick-and-tinted-glass building called Biotech...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/30/magazine/the-recycled-generation.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "WEST, MICHAEL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ADVANCED CELL TECHNOLOGY INC"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "GERON CORP"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STEM CELLS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ABORTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LONGEVITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRANSPLANTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FETAL TISSUE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Stephen", "middlename": "S.", "lastname": "Hall", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By Stephen S.
