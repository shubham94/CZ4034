(TNT) HALF LIGHT -- This comeback vehicle for Demi Moore, who plays a mystery writer trying to put her life back together after the death of her 5-year-old son, went straight to DVD. But fans say its setting -- an isolated fishing village in Scotland -- and its haunting story line are big screen worthy. 8 P.M. (Food Network) EMERIL LIVE -- Emeril Lagasse indulges in a little goodnatured competition with his friend and network rival Mario Batali.
