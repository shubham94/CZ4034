Start in the blighted southeast section of downtown. For every mile traveled to tony Montgomery County in Maryland, life expectancy rises about a year and a half. By the time you get off, says Sir Michael Marmot, a British epidemiologist who has been studying the link between social position and health, you will find a ''20-year gap between poor blacks at one end of the journey and rich whites at the other.'' The notion that status in and of itself -- not just as a stand-in for money, education or nutrition, quality of medical care, bad habits or good genes -- largely determines how healthy you are has become a cutting edge of public health research. Biologists, neurologists, economists, psychologists, primatologists and more have been trying to pinpoint precisely what links the two.
