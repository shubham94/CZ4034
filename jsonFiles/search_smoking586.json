But when he invented a gene therapy technique to treat heart disease, he did what any self-respecting academic scientist does these days: he started a biotechnology company. Today, he has one foot in academia and the other in industry. On campus, he trains doctors and runs a gene therapy lab, financed in part by his company, Collateral Therapeutics. As its chief scientist, he has drummed up support for a public offering of stock, and helped design clinical trials for his therapy.", "snippet": "Dr. H.
