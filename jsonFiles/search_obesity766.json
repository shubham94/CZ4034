Bush administration officials said they would confront France, Germany and other skeptics of military action against Iraq by demanding that they publicly agree that Iraq had defied the Security Council. The officials said they were debating whether to seek a second U.N. resolution authorizing force against Iraq. A1 In a blunt rejection of American impatience toward Baghdad, the leaders of France and Germany said they shared common views on Iraq and advised that any Security Council resolution for military action would have to await the report of weapons inspectors. A10 Iraqis seem increasingly offended by the inspections, and the government appears to be encouraging public complaints about them, even as its officials agreed this week to expand cooperation with the U.N. A10 Members of the Saudi royal family and advisers to Crown Prince Abdullah say chaos from the breakdown of the existing order in Iraq has become an overarching fear. The prince is said to be trying to persuade President Bush to go along with a strategy in which a decision to go to war is followed by a pause for intensive diplomacy to remove Saddam Hussein. A1 Israeli Labor Party Behind Polls show that the Labor Party's candidate for prime minister, Amram Mitzna, holds positions that are extremely popular. Yet the polls indicate that Labor is headed for a drubbing in elections. The party that built Israel may slip below 20 seats in the 120-seat Parliament. A3 North Korea's Weapons Claim North Korea said it had no intention of producing nuclear weapons, making the pledge to South Korea in high-level talks in which both sides appeared to be playing to different audiences. A12 Quake Emergency in Mexico President Vicente Fox declared a state of emergency in Colima, a coastal state hit overnight by a powerful earthquake that rolled across central Mexico from the Pacific Ocean, killing at least 29 people and rattling millions of Mexico City residents. A5 NATIONAL A14-23 Housing Funds Planned For Religious Groups The Bush administration is planning to allow religious groups for the first time to use federal housing money to help build facilities where religious worship takes place, as long as part of the building is also used for social services. A1 U.S. Retracts Health Policy The Bush administration said it was rescinding a new policy that allowed managed care organizations to limit coverage of emergency services for poor people on Medicaid. A14 Inquiry Into Pelican Deaths Federal officials are investigating the deaths in California of several brown pelicans that appear to have been purposely killed, despite belonging to a federally protected endangered species. A14 A New Cabinet Secretary The Senate unanimously confirmed Tom Ridge as the nation's first secretary of homeland security, with Democrats and Republicans alike heaping praise on Mr. Ridge even as they warned that his huge new department faced a daunting responsibility to prevent terrorist attacks on American soil. A13 Bush Backs Abortion Protests President Bush told tens of thousands of abortion protesters that he shared their commitment to ''protect the lives of innocent children waiting to be born,'' and asserted that the anti-abortion movement was gaining steam in Congress and the culture at large. A16 Vote on Clean Air Rules Voting along regional and party lines, the Republican-controlled Senate rejected an attempt to delay new pollution rules that many Democrats say will roll back clean air standards and endanger human health. A23 Justices Rule in Bias Case The Supreme Court ruled that owners of real estate agencies cannot ordinarily be sued for the discriminatory actions of the agents who work for them, but their companies can still be held liable. A18 Steep Rise in Identity Theft According to the Federal Trade Commission, identity theft complaints nearly doubled in 2002, continuing to make it the most widely reported consumer crime since the agency started issuing reports three years ago. A18 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Sharpton's Headquarters Damaged by Fire The ballroom at the Harlem headquarters of the National Action Network, where the Rev. Al Sharpton has held court for six years, was destroyed by fire. City officials released a statement saying the fire was not suspicious and was probably caused by an electrical problem. B1 School Integration Agreement Seven years after Connecticut's highest court ordered the state to end racial disparities in Hartford's overwhelmingly black and Hispanic schools, state officials settled on a $245 million integration plan that civil-rights lawyers representing the students called a historic, if incomplete, step to reforming the city's impoverished education system. B5 Deadly Mob Saga Detailed In 1987, an imprisoned crime boss ordered the killing of a former mob prosecutor. But a pair of hitmen killed his father by mistake, prosecutors said in a sweeping indictment. And that was the start of a long mob saga with an escalating body count. B2 McDonald's Lawsuit Dismissed A federal judge in Manhattan dismissed a lawsuit that sought to hold McDonald's Corporation liable for damages related to obesity and ill health in teenagers, saying there was no evidence that McDonald's had concealed information about its ingredients.

B7 BUSINESS DAY C1-12 AOL Weighs Sale of Book Unit AOL Time Warner is seeking to sell its book publishing unit in an effort to pay down some of the heavy debts taken on with AOL's acquisition of Time Warner, people involved in the discussions said. A1 Master Key Copying Revealed A security researcher at AT&T Labs-Research has revealed a little-known vulnerability in many lock systems that lets someone take any key from an entire building and create a copy of the master key for that building. C1 Merrill Lynch Turns Profit A continuing campaign of cost-cutting helped Merrill Lynch & Company swing a profit in the fourth quarter, but the firm's executives do not expect a rebound soon and they forecast more trouble for the industry and fewer jobs at Merrill. C1 Chase Looks Ahead After Loss J. P. Morgan Chase reported a fourth-quarter loss of 20 cents a share, 2 cents a share bigger than last year, mostly because of $1.3 billion in expected charges, and tried to convince investors that its worst problems were behind it.
