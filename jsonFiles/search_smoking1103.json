Researchers said the finding could aid understanding of the causes of endometrial cancer, which strikes 37,000 American women each year and kills 2,900. The new report corroborates earlier evidence that smoking lowers the incidence of endometrial cancer and is consistent with previously observed links between smoking and estrogen-related body changes on the one hand and between estrogen levels and rates of endometrial cancer on the other. Estrogen, an important female hormone, is known to stimulate growth of cells in the endometrium and is believed to promote cancer when it is not counterbalanced by another hormone.", "snippet": "Heavy cigarette smoking by women reduces their risk of developing cancer of the lining of the uterus, the endometrium, but this benefit is vastly outweighed by other health hazards of smoking, according to a new report.
