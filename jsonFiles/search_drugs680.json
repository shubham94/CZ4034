In many others, though, their presence may have achieved the opposite of what the writers intended: they made readers wonder whether they were being conned. I'm not talking about the partisan political operatives whose apparent license to spin, sneer and smear devalues so much political reporting. I'm concerned with those experts rolled out to explain or contextualize complex matters (as reporters who use them would argue) or to confirm what the reporter already thinks (as far too many readers believe).

In the 24 minutes since guards had last checked her, she had tied a bed sheet around her neck and, after many attempts over three years in prison, finally strangled herself. When word of Roger's suicide spread through the cellblocks of the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility that sultry weekend, two correction officers cried. Fellow inmates were angry. The superintendent, who was away for a few days, was devastated. A mentally ill young woman had died, and she had died in the most stressful and isolating place in the New York state prison system. Jessica Roger, 21, killed herself in the ''box,'' and many thought she didn't belong there. For more than a third of Roger's 1,200 days at the prison in Westchester County, she was, as she said in a letter to her mother, ''locked up and locked in'' as punishment for her fits of rage and resistance. For 250 days, she was confined to her cell, unable to participate in programs or communal meals. She spent another 160 days in the ''special housing unit,'' what inmates call the box. The box is the most severe punishment in prison: the final threat, the ultimate time out. It is a small barren chamber set apart from the general population with a concrete floor, a steel door and no clock to mark the time. The essential quality of the box is isolation -- a gloved hand passes food through a slot in the door; a caseworker's muffled voice filters through the holes in a small Plexiglas window. Inmates are allowed few personal possessions. Lights are never fully extinguished. It is four walls for 23 hours a day -- a psychologically punishing experience by design. For people like Jessica Roger, it can also be an incubator of psychosis.", "headline": {"main": "A Death in the Box"}, "abstract": "Mary Beth Pfeiffer article traces how American prisons have become nation's primary supplier of mental-health services; says about 250,000 Americans with mental illness live in prisons, many committed for petty crimes; says they do poorly in prison atmosphere, creating scenes and lashing out unpredictably, often ending up in 'special housing unit', described as box; says prison officials are well aware of situation and have been sued over special housing units in at least 10 states; says treatment has led to suicide attempts, many successful, by the mentally ill; cites case history of Jessica Roger, who committed suicide while in isolation in Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, New York; photos (L)", "print_page": "48", "word_count": 4716, "_id": "4fd2a4868eb7c8105d88acee", "snippet": "Jessica Roger had been in and out of mental hospitals 17 times since she was 11 years old.
