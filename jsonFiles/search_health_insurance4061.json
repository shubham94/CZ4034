The unions had contributed huge sums to the Democrats, and when an issue came along that seemed to threaten jobs and wages, they called in their chits. But in the cynical competition for Congressional votes, another familiar player -- private industry -- was absent. Businesses that would normally have promised big money to persuade Democrats to vote the other way were nowhere to be found. The reason, according to a new study, is that business is deserting the Democrats. When the trade vote took place, Democrats noted and in many cases openly rejoiced in labor's resurgence. At the same time, they privately wondered about the disappearance of business groups in high technology, financial services and other areas that would predictably have pressed them to support legislation giving the President enhanced power to negotiate trade agreements.
