The new regulation, announced by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Margaret M. Heckler, and Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, creates advisory review committees within each hospital. It is a major shift in the way the Federal Government has been dealing with handicapped infants, and it is to take effect in 30 days, on Feb. 11.

A few weeks later, another California baby is expected to become the second example of this newest method of providing children to couples unable to conceive them naturally. Neither child will be genetically related to the woman who will give it birth. Each baby was conceived within the body of another woman altogether, an ''ovum donor,'' and is the result of the union of its father's sperm and the donor's egg. After five days within the donor's uterus, at a time when it consisted of only 80 to 100 cells arranged in a fluid-filled sphere, each embryo was removed by a process known as lavage, or ''washing out,'' and then placed within the infertile womb of its father's wife, where it developed normally.", "headline": {"main": "HUMAN EMBRYO TRANSPLANTS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "42", "word_count": 4418, "_id": "4fd13cef8eb7c8105d6139ad", "snippet": "Harris Brotman is a Chicago-based writer with a doctorate in genetics.
