Museums * ''BLACK ROMANTIC: THE FIGURATIVE IMPULSE IN CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN-AMERICAN ART,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through June 23). If you need to be reminded how big the world of art is and how small the art world is, take a look at what's here. A much anticipated, mixed-bag gamble of a populist theme show, it is a survey of figure paintings by 30 black artists from across the country, a mishmash of good and bad that betrays distressing curatorial disregard for bedrock quality and style distinctions, ostensibly held together as an overview of feel-good pictures extolling black culture. What results is an equal-opportunity Rorschach test. Everyone will bring his own prejudices and neuroses to the table. Annoying though it partly is, ''Black Romantic'' nevertheless willy-nilly offers up some persuasive art and raises genuine, important issues: why wouldn't some of what passes for art in Chelsea be interchangeable with what's here? Why is one (white) figurative artist awarded points for imitating an old master and another (black) artist dismissed for doing that? Whom does a place like the Studio Museum serve? ''Black Romantic'' forces all this into the open, where it should be. For that, and for giving a wider audience to a few fine painters, unknown to the parochial, predominantly white art world, it's on balance a plus. Hours: Sundays and Wednesdays through Fridays, noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 for students and 62+; $1, children under 12 (Michael Kimmelman).", "headline": {"main": "ART GUIDE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "40", "word_count": 4319, "_id": "4fd268bb8eb7c8105d81ef4d", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend.
