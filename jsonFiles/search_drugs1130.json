While the courts have handed down multimillion-dollar awards based on the presumption of a health hazard, leading yesterday to Dow Corning's declaration of bankruptcy, the heavy-duty scientific studies now being completed have pointed to exactly the opposite conclusion, that there is no evidence that breast implants are harmful. Part of the reason for this clash of cultures is that the legal world looks at individual cases of illness, whereas scientists hold that specially designed studies of whole populations are the only sure touchstone of truth. The cases that have convinced the courts concern women who complain of debilitating and mysterious maladies that they attribute to silicone leaking from their breast implants. Several years ago, those individual cases, typically described as \"anecdotes\" by scientists, prompted several epidemiological studies to be undertaken in an effort to search for statistically valid links between the implants and any disease.", "headline": {"main": "Legal System and Science Come to Differing Conclusions on Silicone"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": 1706, "_id": "4fd1cc708eb7c8105d702a7a", "snippet": "In the case of silicone breast implants, the courts and much of the scientific world have proceeded on strikingly unparallel tracks.
