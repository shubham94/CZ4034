Heroin addiction, while still more prevalent among the poor, has recently risen among members of the white middle class, rehabilitation experts say. And cocaine appears to be contributing to the increase. A state study has found that some cocaine abusers have become addicted to heroin after experimenting with that drug to overcome the mental anxieties created by cocaine. At the same time, cocaine, once the exclusive preserve of wealthy drug users, has become a popular street drug.", "headline": {"main": "DRUG FLOOD ALTERING PATTERNS OF USE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1951, "_id": "4fd14fd28eb7c8105d6307d2", "snippet": "Supplies of illegal heroin and cocaine have grown so plentiful in the New York City area that drug experts see a dissolving of the traditional lines between people who use the two drugs as well as between people who sell them.

For over-12's, the street scene in Covent Garden, which features buskers and dancers, and Madame Tussaud's wax museum and planetarium have proved very popular. On a more serious level, kids like the Tower of London, with Crown jewels and Beefeaters, very much. The telephone directory's Yellow Pages have a list of baby-sitting agencies. One that can be highly recommended is Universal Aunts, 250 Kings Road, London SW3 (telephone 351-5767). They will also meet children arriving alone by plane, and they conduct sightseeing tours for them, singly or in groups. For real emergencies, dial 999 and give particulars to the operator.
