Dr Eric Chivian, director of Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, says it is impossible to predict exact impact of global warming on complex systems, but says there is no uncertainty that changes will severely threaten life, including human life; Dr Howard Frumkin, director of National Center for Environmental Health and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, contends that while absolute certainty of impact of global warming is not known, it is incumbent on scientific community to anticipate and prepare for potential harm that can arise; Nick Tataryn says exploring solutions is imperative; Daniel A Segal, anthropology professor at Pitzer College, says it is important to pay attention to responsible efforts to control global warming rather than to act as if it does not exist; Russ Weiss says dispute over handling global warming is between responsible scientists and Bush administration, whose policy is to do almost nothing; Alan Schulman says debate over global warming detracts from issues and from finding solutions;
