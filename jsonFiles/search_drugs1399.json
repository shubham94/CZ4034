Fortunately, it was a clean needle. I was starting an IV on a baby, and after several unsuccessful attempts I had finally threaded a tiny plastic catheter into a twisty little hand vein. I reached for a fresh syringe, full of sterile saline, trying to keep the catheter steady, and when I tried to unscrew the needle attached to the new syringe, I handled it clumsily and felt a small but real prick through the rubber glove I was wearing into my thumb. Reasonably enough, I didn't worry too much about it at the time. True, the baby had AIDS, but you don't transmit the HIV virus by sticking yourself with a clean needle when there's an AIDS patient in the room. I started to get paranoid in the bleary hours of the morning, when I found myself, as usual, sitting in my rocking chair and nursing my daughter. What if somehow the virus had gotten into that tiny hole made in my skin by that sterile needle? I was looking down at my daughter's head, as she suckled and snorted with that avid middle-of-the-night concentration, and I was insanely terrified that my breast milk was contaminated.", "headline": {"main": "Hers; Mothers With AIDS: A Love Story"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": 1349, "_id": "4fd19ea28eb7c8105d6b1d42", "snippet": "WHEN MY DAUGHter was 4 months old, I stuck myself with a needle.
