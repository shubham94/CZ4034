Most of the congregants are women. Whether for social or biological reasons or both, said the Rev.

Well, in the next election, Ms. Watson was cleaned away with a big-money television blitz by a group calling itself Farmers for Fairness, a euphemism for the hog growers. As long as such front groups avoid the words ''vote for'' or ''vote against,'' they are not regulated by campaign finance laws. Thus, by courtesy of a much criticized Supreme Court ruling, special interests have been granted the rights of free speech once reserved for individuals, insuring that plenty of money is available to enhance corporate welfare.", "snippet": "Bill Moyers begins ''Free Speech for Sale,'' tonight's vigorous assault on the power of moneyed interests in American politics, with the story of Cindy Watson, a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly who took on the state's hog..."}], "meta": {"offset": 0, "hits": 2, "time": 32}}}
