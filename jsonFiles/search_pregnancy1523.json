By contrast, another archetypal modern motif, the grid, reflects the architectural fabric of modernity and an infinitely extendable space of Cartesian rationality. In art, the grid tends to sponsor formalist tendencies; the orb often inspires Symbolism, Surrealism or primitivism. The show bears this out, including as it does a number of well-known artists associated with mystical romance, like Joseph Cornell, whose 1958 shadowbox contains a cork ball and a smiling Victorian sun against a white, empyrean beyond; Richard Pousette-Dart, in whose small abstract painting (1967) a haze of cosmic light radiates from a center of concentric circles, and Alfonso Ossorio, whose circular mixed-media assemblage (1967) of bones and glass eyeballs is like a scary fetish of some not fully civilized tribe.", "headline": {"main": "'Essence of the Orb'", "kicker": "ART IN REVIEW"}, "abstract": "Ken Johnson reviews Essence of the Orb, wide-ranging selection of works at Michael Rosenfeld Gallery (S)", "print_page": "34", "word_count": 253, "_id": "4fd20b0c8eb7c8105d778ea0", "snippet": "Michael Rosenfeld Gallery   24 West 57th Street   Manhattan   Through Thursday        This wide-ranging selection of works proposes that the orb is one of the archetypal motifs of modern art.
