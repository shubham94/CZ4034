The families were united by a marriage and grew, over three generations, into a closely knit clan numbering scores of people. But they did not find prosperity under the California sun, and in time, the police here say, virtually all of them acquired long criminal records. In an unusual legal confrontration, the Pasadena Police Department is trying to break up this family in an effort to end what it calls a ''cycle of crime that is transmitted from generation to generation.'' It is seeking a court order designating four of the youngest members of the clan, who range in age from 18 months to 10 years, as wards of the court, so they can be placed in foster homes.", "headline": {"main": "OFFICIALS ON COAST ASK COURT TO TAKE 4 CHILDREN FROM FAMILY'S 'CYCLE OF CRIME'"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "word_count": 1210, "_id": "4fd10f7d8eb7c8105d5c47f0", "snippet": "More than 30 years ago, a family in Waco, Tex., and another in Prentiss, Miss., followed the same dream that lured millions of other migrants to California and moved to a predominately black neighborhood here.
