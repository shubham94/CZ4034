This undoubtedly accounted for the reputation of spinach as a food rich in iron and calcium that children should eat if they want to be strong. In recent years a more sophisticated understanding of how nutrients are absorbed through the intestines into the body and of the many factors that can interfere with that absorption has led to a complete rethinking of the utility of foods and food combinations. Haters of spinach, for example, can now rejoice, for it turns out that it is not all that it is touted to be: it contains substances that impair absorption of iron and calcium. To be sure, the study of food-nutrient interactions is an infant science that requires much more research before the interactions are well understood. But they have become increasingly important in recent years, in part because of the increased consumption of vegetables, whole grains and other sources of dietary fiber.", "snippet": "NUTRITIONAL scientists once assumed that if a food contained a good deal of a particular nutrient it was a good dietary source of that nutrient.
