He has been known for the beguiling physicality of his solos, the complexity of his group works and his confrontational gestures and words. The Muhammad Ali of the dance world, he possesses an audacity, eloquence and insolence that have elicited both awe and irritation.", "headline": {"main": "Bill T.
