The changes are reversing a trend that made a person's danger to himself or to others the sole legal grounds for involuntary commitment. Lawyers and psychiatrists have battled for decades over the rights of mental patients and their treatment needs. In the 1970's, the lawyers by and large prevailed, and stringent limitations were placed on involuntary commitment of the mentally ill. Now, the psychiatrists are winning victories, with six states adopting a new standard that makes it possible to commit mentally disturbed people who are unable to provide for basic needs, such as shelter, or who would suffer ''severe and abnormal mental, emotional or physical distress'' if they are not hospitalized. The new laws, in effect, allow hospitalization to prevent a worsening of already existing mental illness or to prevent the physical harm such deterioration might bring.", "headline": {"main": "STATES MOVE TO EASE LAW COMMITTING MENTALLY ILL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1808, "_id": "4fd1735c8eb7c8105d6679b6", "snippet": "A NUMBER of states are changing their laws to make it easier to commit the mentally ill for involuntary treatment.
