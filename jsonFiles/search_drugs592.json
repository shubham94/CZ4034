He weighs about 12 pounds and measures 34 inches from the tip of his tail to the sutured incision on the top of his head. His fur is a m\u00e9lange of black, yellow and olive, with white underparts and a coal-black face. Until his operation, two days before I met him, he was skittering about an open-air enclosure on the grounds of a biomedical facility on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. Afterward, he was caged in a hut shared with half a dozen other experimental monkeys, all of whom bore identical incisions in their scalps. Judging from the results of previous experiments, the human neural stem cells inserted into their brains would soon take hold and begin to grow, their fibers reaching out to shake hands with their monkey counterparts. The green vervets' behavior was, and will remain, all monkey. To a vervet, eye contact signals aggression, and when I peered into X047's cage, he took umbrage, vigorously bobbing his head in a stereotypical threat display. Still, it was hard not to stare. By virtue of the human material added to his brain, XO47 is a chimera -- that is, an organism assembled out of living parts taken from more than one biological species. The word comes from the monstrous creature of Greek mythology -- part lion, part serpent and part goat -- that is slain by the hero Bellerophon. Less fearsome chimeras occur naturally -- lichen, for instance, is a mix of fungus and algae. Most, however, are created in the laboratory by scientists like Dr. Eugene Redmond of Yale University, the soft-spoken, 65-year-old psychiatrist and neurosurgeon who operated on XO47. He set up the St. Kitts Biomedical Foundation on this island because that is where the monkeys are -- an overabundant feral population of them, ideally suited for research. Redmond has transplanted immature human brain cells into a region of XO47's brain that produces dopamine, a neurochemical that is depleted in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease. If the human cells can take hold and differentiate and bolster the monkey's own dopamine-producing machinery, a similar operation on a Parkinson's patient, the reasoning goes, should have an even greater chance of success.", "headline": {"main": "The Other Stem-Cell Debate"}, "abstract": "Jamie Shreeve article on creation of chimeras--organisms assembled out of living parts taken from more than one biological species--as part of research using stem cells; most biologists do not find such research alarming, but bioethicists and policy makers are troubled by recent developments that have made chimeric experiments more common and increasingly capable of producing human-animal amalgamations; driving surge in such experiments is enormous but still untested promise of human stem cells; using animals, scientists can study what controls differentiation of stem cells and how they could be used to treat humans; drawings (L)", "print_page": "42", "word_count": 5063, "_id": "4fd25aef8eb7c8105d807c8a", "snippet": "To test the potential curative powers of human embryonic stem cells, biologists want to inject them into lab animals.
