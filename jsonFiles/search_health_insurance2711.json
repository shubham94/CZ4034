Buffett, said yesterday that second-quarter profit rose as a decline in insurance losses helped offset a drop in underwriting. Quarterly profit was $1.45 billion, or $941 a share, up from $1.28 billion, or $834 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $18.12 billion from $18 billion. The company, based in Omaha, reported insurance premium revenue fell to $5.2 billion from $5.48 billion a year earlier. Earnings from its insurance underwriting fell to $376 million from $422 million, while investment income from its insurance business rose to $585 million from $479 million. (AP) Cardinal Health Posts 27% Decline in Profit A medical products supplier, Cardinal Health, said yesterday that its quarterly earnings fell 27 percent because of restructuring costs and one-time charges, while revenue rose 15 percent. The company, which supplies medicine, medical supplies and services, reported earnings of $287 million, or 66 cents a share, compared with earnings of $394 million, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended June 30 and was the fourth quarter of Cardinal's fiscal year, rose to $19.5 billion from $16.9 billion. Excluding special items and nonrecurring charges of 23 cents a share, the earnings would have been 89 cents a share, matching expectations. (AP) Comcast Gives Chairman a $10 Million Extension The Comcast Corporation, the cable-television company, extended the contract of its chief executive, Brian Roberts, and will pay him at least $10 million a year in salary and bonus for the next five years. Mr. Roberts, 46, will also receive deferred compensation starting at $2 million this year and rising to $2.43 million by 2009, the company said in a regulatory filing. Mr. Roberts became chief executive in November 2002. (Bloomberg News) Boeing's Head of Satellite-Intelligence Unit Retires Boeing said yesterday that the head of its satellite-intelligence unit would retire at the end of the year. The executive, Roger Roberts, 58, will be succeeded on an interim basis by Howard Chambers, vice president for program management, a Boeing spokeswoman, Marta Newhart, said. Projects being led by Mr. Roberts include the Air Force's $19.5 billion Future Imagery Architecture spy-satellite program. Boeing named Mr. Roberts as head of the space and intelligence systems division in 1997 when it acquired the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. (Bloomberg News) British Airways Profit Doubles on Increase in Passengers British Airways said yesterday that its first-quarter profit more than doubled as revenue increased 8.3 percent. Net profit for the three months ending June 30 rose to \u00a390 million ($160 million) from \u00a343 million. Revenue rose to \u00a32.06 billion ($3.7 billion). Pretax profits rose 65 percent, to \u00a3124 million. The chief executive, Rod Eddington, left, said the results were driven by more customers flying in premium priced seats. He added that the airline had record first-quarter passenger load factors, a measure of how full its planes were across the network. British Airways warned that its annual fuel bill was likely to be \u00a375 million ($133.5 million) more than previously thought. (AP) Shell to Challenge $131 Million Tax Claim in Venezuela The international oil group Royal Dutch/Shell will challenge a $131 million tax demand made by Venezuela's tax authority as part of a wider review of foreign companies, a company official said yesterday. Shell received notification of the back tax demand from the tax authority on July 14, and was then given 15 working days to pay the amount in addition to a 10 percent fine. Officials from the oil company insist Shell has paid all the taxes it owes and are preparing a response now that the 15-day period has ended. (Reuters) Canadian Bank to Pay $250 Million in Enron Case The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said yesterday it would pay the Enron Corporation $250 million to resolve claims the lender aided accounting fraud, bringing it closer to resolving a costly legal dispute with the bankrupt energy trader. The bank, which on Tuesday agreed to pay Enron shareholders $2.4 billion, is the third of 10 financial institutions to settle the so-called MegaClaims litigation. (Bloomberg News) Investment and Asset Units Drive Profit at British Bank Barclays posted a 2 percent increase in profits in the first half of the year, driven by its investment banking and asset management units, the bank said yesterday. The bank, based in London, said profit rose to \u00a31.84 billion ($3.3 billion) from \u00a31.8 billion. The increase was driven by a 19.6 percent increase in profit in the investment banking unit, which helped offset a 17 percent decline in credit card profit and a decline in profit in the retail bank sector. Bad debts rose 20 percent, to \u00a3706 million ($1.26 billion). (AP) S.E.C. Inquiry of Payments by Oil Producers Several oil producers -- Exxon Mobil, Marathon Oil, Amerada Hess and Devon Energy -- said yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission had started a formal investigation into payments made to the government of Equatorial Guinea. The S.E.C. has requested documents from the companies and other oil and gas producers that have operations in Equatorial Guinea. They all said they were cooperating with the investigation that began informally in 2004. Exxon Mobil operates the biggest oilfield in Equatorial Guinea. Exxon Mobil, Marathon, Hess and Devon were part of an informal inquiry last year into accusations of bribery in the country. (Bloomberg News) Exports Help German Industrial Output Increase Industrial production in Germany, Europe's largest economy, rose more than expected in June as the euro's decline against the dollar bolstered exports and companies invested more in construction and goods like factory machinery. Production at factories, utilities, construction sites and mines increased 1.4 percent from May, when it slipped 0.4 percent, the Economy and Labor Ministry in Berlin said yesterday.
