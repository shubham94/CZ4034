Pataki, who refused to return Mayor Giuliani's congratulatory phone call, asked the Mayor to attend a meeting to discuss city issues -- but set off a new feud by scheduling the meeting on Staten Island and inviting nine other city officials as well. The Mayor, according to his press secretary, will not attend, in part because he is offended that he was not invited exclusively. A1. NEW YORK POLICE FACE PATROL CUTS The Giuliani administration acknowledged for the first time that the spending cuts it has proposed to close a $1.1 billion budget gap could force the Police Department to take hundreds of officers off patrol duties and put them into jobs now filled by civilians. A1. NEW YORK CITY JAIL CHIEF SAYS RIKERS IS UNDER CONTROL Despite three days of food and work strikes by thousands of inmates at Rikers Island, the city's Correction Commissioner said that \"we're not losing control\" and insisted that the Giuliani administration's plan to cut the number of correction officers by 900 would not risk the safety of officers or inmates. B3. 11TH POLICE SUICIDE LEAVES QUESTIONS When Officer Daniel Atkinson shot himself in the head with his department-issued 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, he broke a grim record, becoming the 11th officer in the nation's largest police department to take his own life, the most in any year in recent history. B3. REGION TALK-SHOW HOST GETS A REBUKE Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey went back on the Bob Grant radio talk show to politely lecture the show's host on his responsibility to avoid the sometimes \"troubling\" racial comments that occasionally come from him and his callers. B7. NEW JERSEY MAYORS ARE COOL TO WHITMAN Governor Whitman went to the annual convention of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities to ask mayors and town leaders to enter into a new spirit of cooperation and understanding with her administration. But compared with the electrifying response she received at last year's convention, the reaction was subdued. Mayors have complained throughout the convention about the effects the Governor's state tax cuts are beginning to have on their budgets and property taxes. B7. THEY SAID SHE WAS D.O.A.; THEN SHE MOVED The old woman was sprawled on the floor, cold and motionless. Paramedics and the Albany County Coroner found no signs of life. But as a morgue attendant was transferring the body to a funeral home, he noticed movement and a faint breathing sound. She was alive, but unconscious. The coroner -- an elected official who is an insurance agent, not a doctor -- called it a miracle. Health officials were debating whether Albany ought to have a full-fledged medical examiner. B7. SUSPECT SAYS CONFESSION WAS REHEARSED The defendant in the Rockland County murder and carjacking trial said that he was \"rehearsed and coached\" by two detectives into giving a 49-page confession to an assistant district attorney just hours after the crime. B6. D'AMATO EXAMINING BROTHER'S EXAMINERS Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato said he would investigate Justice Department actions in the Federal fraud case against his brother, Armand, that was recently dropped. B8.
