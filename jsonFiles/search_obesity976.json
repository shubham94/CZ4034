But how? One mechanism seems to be an alcohol-induced increase in protective high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which helps to keep arteries free of fatty deposits. A new study by researchers at University Hospital in Zurich points to another important mechanism: reducing the growth of arterial muscle cells that would normally occur after eating a high-fat meal. These cells are big factors in the production of atherosclerosis, a narrowing of the passageways through coronary arteries that is the underlying cause of most heart attacks.", "snippet": "STUDIES involving tens of thousands of men and women have strongly suggested that moderate consumption of alcohol can reduce the risk of heart attacks.
