The suburban communities ringing New York City are in the midst of such a frenzied real-estate boom this spring that from Montauk to Morristown, Stamford to Scarsdale, homes are being snapped up within hours of being offered for sale.

Is there any truth to the belief that an egg can be stood on its end during the equinox? A. According to Dr. Andrew F. Cheng, a physicist at Johns Hopkins University, it is theoretically possible to stand an egg on its end during the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, the two days of the year when the sun is directly above the Equator. At these times the tidal gravitational force due to the sun is directed vertically, facilitating the balancing of an egg on its end - providing the egg is at the Equator. However, this effect is too small to be noticed in kitchen experiments where such other factors as air pressure, friction, light winds, vibration, and the shape and texture of the egg and the counter come into play. In any event, the tidal force due to the moon is much greater than that due to the sun. If you can balance an egg on its end during the equinox, you can probably balance it on its end at other times as well, Dr. Cheng said. Q. Why are some babies born prematurely? A. ''There is overwhelming evidence that a mother's health is the leading cause of premature birth,'' said Dr. Dharmpuri Vidyasagar, a professor of pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical School. Although premature births can be related to fetal malformations such as birth defects and genetic syndromes, in many cases they are the result of maternal problems such as malnutrition, hypertension, lack of rest, diabetes, abnormalities of the uterus, alcohol or drug abuse, smoking, or poor medical care, Dr. Vidyasagar said.", "headline": {"main": "Q&A"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": 387, "_id": "4fd16d8b8eb7c8105d66056c", "snippet": "Q.
