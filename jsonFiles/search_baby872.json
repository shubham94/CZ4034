Gathering around her bedside like benevolent priests, the doctors told the young couple that, yes, a fetus has been known to live after only 23 weeks' gestation, but that its chances of surviving without severe abnormalities are vanishingly small; a normal pregnancy, after all, lasts about 40 weeks. The doctors said they wouldn't know until they actually saw Jennifer's baby in the delivery room -- because maybe it would be closer to 24 weeks old, in which case the odds improved dramatically. But they explained that every borderline infant must be considered something of a medical experiment. Jennifer is a pretty, spirited 22-year-old with a mop of curly blond hair and wide green eyes. At home in Abington, Mass., taking care of her first child, an 18-month-old daughter named Siarra, Jennifer had seemed mature beyond her years, filled with the uncommon energy and grace it takes to be a good mother. But lying in her hospital bed at Brigham and Women's, hardly showing in her oversize maternity gown, she looked childlike herself, far too young to be facing such grim prospects for her family.", "headline": {"main": "'Does Anyone Here Think Tnis Baby Can Live?'"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "word_count": 11258, "_id": "4fd200498eb7c8105d762f92", "snippet": "The Brigham doctors had tried to prepare the DeCostas for both possibilities when Jennifer first arrived at the hospital three days earlier, having inexplicably gone into labor in her 23d week of pregnancy.
