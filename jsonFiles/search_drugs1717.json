GOODMAN IS A brilliant molecular biologist and dedicated teacher. And, in this revolutionary era of corporate science, he has also become an astute businessman. Two and a half years ago, Goodman made a singular proposal to the officers of the West German- based Hoechst A.G., one of the world's largest chemical companies: Give me enough money to create a 100-person department of molecular biology at an American university, guarantee me 10 years of unrestricted basic research and, in exchange, I'll let you see what I do. Hoechst's response was to offer Goodman nearly $70 million, probably the largest single grant ever made in biology. When it came to writing a contract, Hoechst negotiated an important extra for itself: If Goodman should turn up something potentially marketable, Hoechst would have the exclusive option to license and develop it. The company would not, however, have the right to suggest moneymaking directions the research might take. Hoechst was happy, in spite of its limited role, and so was Howard Goodman. Others were more skeptical. Every institution that depends on the Federal Government for any or all of its financing is staring in the face of a $200 billion national deficit that continues to grow beyond the control of even a conservative Republican President, and that, paradoxically, seems to leave less money for everyone.
