The study found that two relatively new forms of psychotherapy, cognitive behavior therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy, achieved results comparable to a standard antidepressant drug, imipramine, in reducing the symptoms of depression and improving the functioning of patients. All three therapies completely eliminated serious symptoms in 50 to 60 percent of the patients treated for 16 weeks. Praise for Study The study was hailed as a ''landmark'' by the scientists who presented it today at the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting here. Shervert H. Frazier, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, which sponsored the study, called it ''an important contribution to the understanding of these disorders.''", "headline": {"main": "PSYCHOTHERAPY IS AS GOOD AS DRUG IN CURING DEPRESSION, STUDY FINDS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1090, "_id": "4fd1700f8eb7c8105d662ad0", "snippet": "A long-awaited major study has concluded that two important forms of psychotherapy are as effective as a standard drug treatment in curing depression, a mental disorder that afflicts millions of Americans.

In addition to the obvious psychological effects of relieving stress and mental tension, the new findings indicate, deep relaxation, if practiced regularly, can strengthen the immune system and produce a host of other medically valuable physiological changes. In asthmatics, for example, relaxation training has been found to widen restricted respiratory passages. In some diabetics, relaxation can reduce the need for insulin. In many patients with chronic, unbearable pain, the training has brought about significant relief.
