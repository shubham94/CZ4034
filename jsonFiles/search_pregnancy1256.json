The murder was particularly grisly. The baby's body had been dismembered, and authorities in Buena Vista County in Iowa are understandably determined to do a thorough investigation. But crimes that create public revulsion are the most important tests of authorities' willingness to abide by the limits of the Constitution.", "headline": {"main": "Investigative Excesses in Iowa"}, "abstract": "Editorial says Planned Parenthood clinic in Storm, Iowa, is properly refusing to turn over names of women who had pregnancy tests there to prosecutors investigating death of infant whose dismembered body was found at recycling center; says honoring subpoena would undermine confidential environment vital to clinic's operations", "print_page": "24", "word_count": 307, "_id": "4fd238e68eb7c8105d7cc48d", "snippet": "After a dead infant's body was discovered in an Iowa recycling center in May, local investigators issued subpoenas for the names of women who had visited local hospitals and clinics for pregnancy tests in the previous nine months.
