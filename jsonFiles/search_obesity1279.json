Apparently you don't have to run marathons or even minimarathons to be fit. According to the new study of 17,000 Harvard alumni, a brisk three-mile ''daily constitutional'' should do the trick. The study found that men who participated in moderate activity, such as walking, climbing stairs and sports that used 2,000 or more calories a week, had death rates one-quarter to one-third lower than their sedentary counterparts. The life-saving benefits of exercise peaked at expenditures of 3,500 calories a week, beyond which there was, in some cases, a slight detrimental effect.", "snippet": "MANY people were pleasantly surprised by a recent finding that demanding exercise routines are not needed to reap the life-saving benefits of physical activity.
