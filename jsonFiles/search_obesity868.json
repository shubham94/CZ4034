Just one example of a serious consequence of obesity and lack of exercise is adult onset diabetes, now called type-2 diabetes. When I was in medical school 35 years ago, there was very little adult diabetes around and 200-pound women and 250-pound men were extreme rarities. Not every overweight person will develop this disease, which can lead to strokes, blindness, heart attacks, kidney failure and amputations for circulatory problems.
