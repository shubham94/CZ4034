(VH1, VH1 Classic, Palladia) SHINE A LIGHT (2008) Using 18 cameras to capture every groove and growl of his wizened subjects -- the Rolling StonesMick Jagger, Keith Richards (above right with Buddy Guy), Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts -- Martin Scorsese documents the 2006 Beacon Theater stop by the band during its Bigger Bang Tour. ''Ultimately the movie is Mr. Jagger's show,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''If his long-running circus act is ridiculous when you analyze it, conjoined to the Stones' music, it becomes a phenomenal high-wire exhibition of agility, stamina and cheek.'' Mr. Scorsese, he said, ''is a besotted rock 'n' roll fan who wholeheartedly embraces its mythology. Its scruffy guitar heroes and roustabout rebel-prophets are the musical equivalents of the hotheads and outlaws who populate so many of his films. Almost every shot of 'Shine a Light' conveys his excitement.'' The movie ''makes no attempt to explain the Stones or to tell their story,'' Mr. Holden added. ''All it wants to do is to give you the best seat in the house and the best sound you could possibly hope for.'' 7 P.M.
