Fitness spas, where chirpy instructors screamed ''Feel the burn,'' typified the 1980's; everyone jumped and sweated for hours in big, mirror-lined rooms and almost never went outdoors. Now comes a new definition: the holistic spa. True to its New Age name, the holistic spa aims to treat the whole person -- mind, body and spirit -- and gently instill good habits meant to last long after the visit. The prototype calls for a diet of organically grown food that's healthy but ample (no more lettuce-leaf entrees), generous exercise with an emphasis on strength training, hiking and yoga (goodbye step aerobics) and exotic pampering treatments using techniques and natural ingredients from the Far East, ancient India or even the region around the spa. Health services, such as bone density tests, acupuncture and consultations with a nutritionist, are often included in the holistic approach.
