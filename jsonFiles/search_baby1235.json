They met there two weeks ago, and also last June, when the rhododendron and laurel were in bloom. The trees in full leaf provided a shield, preventing outsiders from glimpsing the tennis matches, the softball game or the children tumbling on the greensward. A vehicle constantly patrolled the perimeter of the grounds. The ''cousins'' - the collective name for the 22 fourth-generation heirs of John D. Rockefeller, founder of the Standard Oil Company and one of the great American family fortunes - arrived unobtrusively and were passed through the guarded iron gates. They drove station wagons and sports cars, an occasional Mercedes and a few Jeeps - visible symbols of diverse tastes and life styles.", "headline": {"main": "THE COUSINS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": 5637, "_id": "4fd157b78eb7c8105d63b8f3", "snippet": "Kathleen Teltsch is a reporter on the metropolitan staff of The Times.

For many workers, that would not make much difference. They get little in the way of fringe benefits other than medical insurance or pension plans. But an increasing number, especially those who work for large, unionized manufacturing companies, are getting a quarter of their compensation or more in tax-free benefits such as employer-paid baby-sitting, dental care, legal fees and commuting costs.
