By conservative estimates, they spend nearly $4 billion annually on pills, powders and other sports-nutrition products in the hope that they'll improve health and increase performance. New Orleans Saints center Jeff Faine recently told a reporter that he takes about 65 pills a day; for the sake of time management, he has taught himself to swallow as many as 17 at a time. This daily gorging pales next to that of Bill Romanowski, the former linebacker. In his 2005 autobiography, ''Romo: My Life on the Edge,'' Romanowski writes that he kept a tackle box filled with some 500 pills and would take handfuls a day, all washed down with protein shakes. He also famously admits to taking vials of THG, an anabolic steroid, but most of what he consumed were legal supplements available at any Walgreens or GNC store. Such supplements are not necessarily benign. In 2003, Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler died, in part, from a reaction to ephedrine, a wildly popular supplement used to increase energy and metabolism. Ephedrine, a stimulant derived from the ephedra plant, can elevate heart rate and blood pressure, in some cases fatally. It's now illegal to market ephedrine as a dietary supplement, though it's still widely available, often as a decongestant or a cold remedy.
