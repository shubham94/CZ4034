Gone is all spending for highly restrictive abstinence-only sex education programs that deny young people accurate information about contraceptives, sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. The measure redirects sex-education resources to medically sound programs aimed at reducing teenage pregnancy. Federal support for the wishful abstinence-only approach, which began in the 1980s, ballooned during George W. Bush's presidency. As the funding grew, so did evidence of the policy's failure. A Congressionally mandated study released in 2007 found that elementary and middle school students who received abstinence instruction were just as likely to have sex in the following year as students who did not get such instruction.", "headline": {"main": "End to the Abstinence-Only Fantasy", "kicker": "EDITORIAL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": 376, "_id": "4fd28ef98eb7c8105d865cef", "snippet": "Democratic leaders must see that an amendment to the health care reform bill that would revive a $50 million program for abstinence-only sex education is stricken.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/opinion/20sun2.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "HATCH, ORRIN G"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REFORM AND REORGANIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEALTH INSURANCE AND MANAGED CARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SEX EDUCATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAW AND LEGISLATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ABSTINENCE (SEXUAL)"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2009-12-20T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Some Chicagoans grouse that President Obama has reneged on promises to return home regularly.
