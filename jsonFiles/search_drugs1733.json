However, it is clear t hat some of the more important questions have yet to be answered b y the Reagan Administration. Following are some of the key questions raised by Mr. Reagan's ''federalism initiative,'' together with the answers available today: Q. Why does President Reagan want the Federal Government to assume full responsibility for the cost of Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, that is now shared with the states? A. The President has not given a theoretical justification or rationale. In general, he maintains that welfare programs are ''less costly and more responsive to genuine need'' when they are administered at the local level. But officials say transferring state Medicaid costs to the Federal Government would make sense as part of a large-scale ''sorting out'' of Federal and state responsibilities. The President has to relieve the states of some financial burdens as an inducement for them to accept the many new responsibilities that he wants them to take.", "headline": {"main": "QUESTIONS ON PRESIDENT'S PROPOSALS ON SHARING STATE AND U.S. PROGRAMS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 1426, "_id": "4fd11a018eb7c8105d5d39f2", "snippet": "President Reagan left many questions unanswered when he proposed a comprehensive reshuffling of Federal and state responsibilities for domestic social programs.

This mainly took the form of rescinding some rules, suspending others that were about to take effect, pending review, and reducing enforcement of still others. While the business community applauded these efforts, consumer and environmental groups opposed them. The long-term impact on consumers is expected to depend, to a great degree, on whether industry passes along the savings from regulatory relief and, in areas of health and safety, whether industry shoulders more of the burden for selfregulation. According to an Administration report on President Reagan's first year, the Task Force on Regulatory Relief, led by Vice President Bush, saved businesses and, indirectly, consumers about $2 billion in annual operating costs and about $5 billion in one-time capital investment costs.
