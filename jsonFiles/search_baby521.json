I am reading this book because in another minute I'll be -- but can this be? -- 50. It's actually more a matter of weeks than minutes, and yes, I'm keeping count, but the particulars don't make much difference because it's clear to me that whenever 50 shows up -- it could be tomorrow or two years from now -- it comes as a blow to one's perennially youthful psyche, as impossible to grasp about one's own sprightly self as it seems perfectly plausible when it comes to other people. Reaching one's 50th birthday is no longer a feat the way it was in, say, Montaigne's time, when the odds were against reaching 60 (Montaigne didn't) and ''death of old age'' was ''a rare, singular and extraordinary death.'' Although it pains me to my contrarian core to have to admit to being part of a national trend (or, as some view it, an epidemic), my birth date marks me inescapably as part of the graying herd. I am just another face in a crowd of aging baby boomers, demanding the best golden years money and a well-developed sense of entitlement can buy. It may be true, as Francis Bacon observed, that age will not be defied, but that doesn't mean we're prepared to yield to its advance either. Who, I might ask, ever feels 50 inside? Like the proverbial thin person stuck inside every fat person, inside every 50-year-old is nestled a 30- or 25-year-old -- if not an even younger ghostly self, an adolescent habitu\u00e9 of dreams and fantasies who haunts the sites of ancient traumas, replaying juvenile regrets or hopes, failing the chemistry final or bedding the crush-object who never gave you a second look back then.", "headline": {"main": "Keeping the Forces of Decrepitude at Bay", "kicker": "STYLE"}, "abstract": "The Way We Age Now article by Daphne Merkin on turning 50 and its impact on body and psyche in society that increasingly treats aging as malady; says she feels more defeated than liberated and is not inclined to accept sagging muscle tone and other physical signs of aging with grace; wonders how it is that American women have been so successfully terrorized by thought of showing their age; photo (M)", "print_page": "64", "word_count": "5393", "_id": "4fd252a98eb7c8105d7f8569", "snippet": "I am lying in bed, reading Dr. Gerald Imber's ''Youth Corridor,'' a friendly and sagacious book with helpful drawings and a clearly laid-out text, about the whys and wherefores of plastic surgery.
