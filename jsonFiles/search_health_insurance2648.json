The bill for my grandson's 10 days in the neonatal intensive care unit in a suburban Los Angeles hospital last November was $110,000. Still, the costs of my surgery surprised me. HOSPITAL -- $45,732, all but $211 for unspecified ''miscellaneous'' covered by my insurance. Among the charges were $14,000 for four days in a semiprivate room, $17,668 for my titanium knees, $600 for giving me back my own blood, and $1,136 for unspecified ''supplies.'' SURGEON -- $25,000. How much of that will be covered by my major medical insurance remains to be seen. The surgeon accepts only Medicare. ANESTHESIOLOGIST -- $5,200. Again, we'll have to see what my policy will pay, since the doctor accepts no insurance. PATHOLOGIST -- A mere $640 to confirm what we already knew: advanced arthritis in both knees. REHABILITATION CENTER -- $6,634 for five days as an inpatient, including four days of therapy, with $5,430 expected to be covered by insurance. After some mysterious ''adjustments,'' I was charged only $12. OUTPATIENT PHYSICAL THERAPY -- Thirty visits a year supposedly covered by my insurance. I haven't had to pay a cent so far, but I received a bill for $193 for a first visit and $44 for each subsequent one. No telling how long this will go on, but I will do whatever is needed to return to full physical activity. DRUGS -- Insurance pays most of the cost.
