The states, ever more burdened in the decade since Ronald Reagan's \"new federalism\" began shifting a host of new responsibilities to them, are less able to meet those responsibilities because the recession has dried up tax revenue.

Those in the public eye (politicians, celebrities, journalists) or authority figures like teachers, doctors or ministers are common objects of erotomanic delusions, which sometimes lead to harassment and, more rarely, danger for the object of the delusions.
