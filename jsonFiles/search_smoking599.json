Not only are the northern days still delightfully long but it is also the month for the Edinburgh International Festival, a world-renowned feast of music, dance and theater.

It has been a year since Scotland embarked on a bold democratic experiment, swearing in its first England-free Parliament in almost 300 years and getting to run its own affairs when it comes to things like education and health. The new legislators have yet to move into their custom-made building at Holyrood, but construction can be observed in the Old City, on Edinburgh's south side. When Parliament is in session, the legislators themselves can be seen building Scotland's new political order in their temporary headquarters, near the George IV Bridge.", "snippet": "August may be the best month of all to visit Edinburgh, the most regal of Scottish cities.
