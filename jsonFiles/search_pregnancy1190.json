The director and his international star are both tall, good-looking and smiling as they come down to the hotel lobby to do an interview about the director's first movie. But it is the star, SOPHIA LOREN, who also happens to be the director's mother, who puts an arm around the reporter's shoulder and keeps it there. It is an interesting thing, to be in the clasp of an icon, and Ms. Loren's clasp is as strong as it is warm. Her hair is auburn and softly curling; she wears oversized, lavender-tinted glasses and she is apologizing, on a very humid day, for changing the site of the interview. This weather makes your hair look like hell, Ms. Loren says. The arm remains around the shoulder. The film is ''Between Strangers,'' a story of three unhappy women, and it will be shown on the Women's Entertainment channel in early October. It was written and directed by Ms. Loren's younger son, EDOARDO PONTI. The cast includes KLAUS MARIA BRANDAUER, G\u00c9RARD DEPARDIEU, MALCOLM McDOWELL and MIRA SORVINO, each of whom, Mr. Ponti said, worked for $75,000. At the 2002 Venice Film Festival, critics were not impressed, and the Italian director DINO RISI accused Ms. Loren of carrying out ''Operation Mamma.'' A week later, he apologized. On Monday, Mr. Ponti, who is 30 and studied film at the University of Southern California, and Ms. Loren, who will turn 69 tomorrow, sat down for lunch in the Essex House. ''You like a glass of wine? No?'' Ms. Loren asks, the tone suggesting surprise and disappointment. And, looking over the menu, ''Pasta here? No, I eat pasta in Italy.'' Occasionally, in talking to her son, she lapses into a sentence or two of Italian. ''Mi amore,'' she calls him. The mood between them is affectionate. Mr. Ponti has an apartment in Geneva, which he shares with his older brother, CARLO PONTI Jr., 34, a conductor, and their girlfriends; Ms. Loren lives a few miles away. She has little to say about her personal life of present, only that her husband and mentor, the producer CARLO PONTI, is about to turn 90. But she will recall remaining in bed for eight months for each pregnancy, which comes as a surprise to her younger son. ''Eight months for me? I didn't know that,'' Mr. Ponti says, and, ''I thought for me it was easier.'' ''Not for you, for me it was easier, because I knew I would have another baby before, but anyway I would like to have another one,'' Ms. Loren says, her English a little fractured but her meaning clear. ''But I was very scared when I had to deliver you, to know that I had to do another Caesarean and some other things all over again.'' For the most part, she leaves the conversation to her son. He insists he acquired his stars because they liked his script. He also says he based much of the woman his mother plays on her. ''Extremely vulnerable, extremely fragile and one who has an undercurrent of great strength,'' Mr. Ponti says. ''Slow, determined strength. Sometimes I use the analogy for my mother, 'She has the strength of a drop of water.' In other words, if some piece of water will fall on granite, a drop over years, it's going to carve a hole.'' The mother laughs. Sounds as if you were nagging him, Ms. Loren is told. ''Oh, no, no,'' she says. How is Ms. Loren fragile and vulnerable? ''Even though I look aggressive, I look very, very much sure of myself, Ms. Loren says. ''I'm not at all like this.'' Mr. Ponti tries to explain: ''It is for me this great, great sensitivity that she has in a way. I think that what we have to talk about is the hair-trigger emotionality of this person, of really being so honest with her heart, with her feelings, which in essence makes a person vulnerable.'' He gestures to his mother, who is sitting with her hands clasped in her lap. ''Look at her body language now,'' Mr. Ponti says. Ms. Loren laughs nervously. ''Please,'' she says softly, in a way so that one is not certain this should continue. ''What does that say?'' the son presses. That she is trying to keep herself from speaking and let her son have the floor? ''I think she is bracing herself, because we talk about her and it makes her shy in a certain way,'' Mr. Ponti says. Later, the two are asked about those who said Mr. Ponti was able to cast his stars through his mother's influence.
