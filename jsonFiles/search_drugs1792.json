To some scientists, all of these diverse health emergencies, each involving widely different bacteria, are united by a common thread. In each case, the ultimate source of the damage to human patients is not so much the various bacteria that cause food poisoning, or become resistant to drugs, or make the special poison that causes the symptoms of diphtheria. Rather, the harm is done by wandering pieces of genetic material that infect those bacteria and give them special, harmful traits. In some cases the manner in which these genes move from place to place is known. In others it is only suspected and, in many cases, it is still entirely mysterious. The total effect on human and animal health, however, is vast.", "headline": {"main": "WANDERING BITS OF GENETIC MATERIAL ARE BLAMED FOR VAST HEALTH HARM"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1264, "_id": "4fd10f808eb7c8105d5c498d", "snippet": "THE emergency may be a case of food poisoning, with nausea and great discomfort; a gunshot wound, infected and suddenly resistant to most of the standard antibiotic drugs; or diphtheria, an infectious disease that is uncommon today, but a threat to...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/19/science/wandering-bits-of-genetic-material-are-blamed-for-vast-health-harm.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "GENETICS AND HEREDITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BACTERIA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD CONTAMINATION AND POISONING"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By HAROLD M.
