Scientists have been trying to identify what ancillary pleasure might be responsible for keeping people hooked on smoking, since nicotine itself does not produce clear-cut addictive behavior in laboratory tests. They suspect that nicotine enhances some associated sensation in the smoking experience, perhaps taste, and that once such a connection is established, nicotine becomes its own reward.
