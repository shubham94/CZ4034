For a moment, the night is still. The Chicago wind rattles the loose tenement windows, and a grumbling muffler echoes down an otherwise-silent street. Then Moore slips a Kenny G disc into her oversize player, and a struggle ensues between his soothing sounds and her early-morning flurry. She flicks on the bare bulbs that glare from the ceiling and marches into the room of her 14-year-old son, Marchello. \"Get your butt up,\" she says.", "headline": {"main": "Better Work Than Welfare.
