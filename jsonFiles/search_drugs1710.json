Truly flew the space shuttle Columbia to a safe landing on a dry lake bed in California two years ago he was beset by the fear that he was developing motion sickness. Indeed, at least a third of the astronauts who have flown in space have been beset by feelings of dizziness and nausea, and for centuries, many otherwise dauntless travelers, from skippers of ocean going vessels to racing car drivers, have been similarly humbled. Now, however, a new method for administering drugs, a procedure called transdermal medication, has been developed that uses neither pills nor injections but rather lets the medicine seep through the skin. It is not only helping astronauts and other travelers overcome their occasional bouts of motion sickness, disorientation and malaise. But its apparent success in that area has encouraged at least six pharmaceutical houses to work toward using transdermal medication for cancer chemotherapy, duodenal ulcers, glaucoma, asthma, allergies, hypertension and diabetes, as well as contraception.", "headline": {"main": "DRUGS: NEW METHOD PROVES EFFECTIVE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1439, "_id": "4fd12e688eb7c8105d5f9c2c", "snippet": "ONLY hours before Capt.

You stop noticing the stunned pedestrians with blood trickling down their cheeks who happened to be standing on the street when the lethal Mercedes - the favorite choice of Beirut car bombers - suddenly turned into a ball of flame. You stop seeing the smoldering charred carcasses of the other automobiles engulfed in the blast or the chaos of the rescue workers as they scurry around on tiptoe between the shards of glass and twisted car parts to pry out the dead and wounded. Instead, after a while, you find your mind focusing on the incongruities: the juicy roast chickens that were blown all over the street from an adjacent restaurant but somehow still look good enough to eat, or the smell of liquor from a shelf full of broken Johnnie Walker bottles. And eventually, after seeing enough car bombs, you start to notice the leaves: When a car packed with 100 sticks of dynamite explodes on a crowded street, the force of the blast knocks all the leaves off the trees and the road is left choking with them like an autumn lawn. Red Cross workers still tell the story of the man they found at a car bombing near the Ministry of Information whose chest was blown open. They knew he was still alive because through the blood that filled his mouth, little air bubbles kept surfacing. The thing they remembered most, though, was that two leaves had come to rest gently on his face - one on each eye.", "headline": {"main": "LIVING WITH THE VIOLENCE OF BEIRUT"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": 6610, "_id": "4fd12e718eb7c8105d5fa243", "snippet": "ALL CAR BOMB SCENES start to look the same after a while.
