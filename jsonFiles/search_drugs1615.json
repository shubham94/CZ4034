Under the pressure of an Aug. 15 deadline, they must develop a plan acceptable to the city to acquire, reconstruct and begin operating some property -probably an old hotel - for about 100 dependent lower-income single adults. Acceptance will mean that they will be able to use the $2 million that the Macklowe Corporation agreed to pay to help build and maintain single-room-occupancy dwellings, in exchange for the acceptance of a plea of guilty to misdemeanor charges resulting from the illegal demolition of four Times Square buildings last January. The vice president for construction, John Tassi, also pleaded guilty. The brokers keep calling, said the Rev. John M. Felice, co-director with the Rev. John J. McVean of the highly regarded residences known as St. Francis I, at 125 East 24th Street, and St. Francis II, at 155 West 22d Street.
