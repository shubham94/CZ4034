They reflect America's failure to adopt a national health care system that covers all Americans, one that is affordable and financed fairly, based on ability to pay. The more than 40 million uninsured Americans can surely empathize with the victims' families because they, too, need health care coverage. It's time for our government to face this issue, not to be put off by the lobbying and campaign contributions of the insurance companies and others in the health care industry who insist that coverage exists to assure profits for companies rather than care for consumers.
