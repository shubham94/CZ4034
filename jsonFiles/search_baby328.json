It was an event that would force Beaulieu not only to confront the death of her child but also to embrace a new way of dying. We were sitting last spring in the kitchen of her small apartment in Manchester, N.H. Beaulieu took a drag on a Marlboro, poured a cup of coffee and told me that her daughter, Amanda Panzini, had been a rambunctious, bighearted teenager. She loved animals, even ''flea-ridden, mangy dogs,'' Beaulieu said, and was a fiercely loyal friend. When confronted by the possibility of donating her brain-injured daughter's organs after the accident, Beaulieu never doubted that Amanda would have wanted them to go to someone who needed them. But Amanda first had to be declared dead, and in her case, the only way that could happen was if her parents chose a precisely choreographed death -- one conducted by medical personnel in a hospital procedure meant to allow Amanda to die while preserving her organs. From this, the doctors and Beaulieu hoped, would come new life. The last time Beaulieu talked to her daughter was on the morning of June 21, 2008, a Saturday. Amanda attended an eighth-grade dance the night before; she told her mother that she had her first kiss there. After Beaulieu left for work at a nearby minimart, Amanda decided to ride her bike a few blocks to her friend Kate's house. She didn't take her helmet. At the crossing of Taylor and Young Streets, a Ford F-150 pickup truck slammed into Amanda and threw her into the street. When the paramedics arrived, Amanda wasn't breathing. They inserted a tube into her windpipe and rushed her to Elliot Hospital nearby. Beaulieu received an emergency call at the minimart; the paramedics had identified Amanda by the name engraved on her iPod.", "headline": {"main": "The Last Decision"}, "abstract": "Doctors follow new protocol for organ donation that brings into question definition of death; organ donation typically follows brain death of patient, but some doctors and hospitals are now harvesting organs following cardiac death, which is 'irreversible cessation' of heartbeat; families share stories of difficult decision to allow their children to die and organs to be taken for transplantation; until recently, donation from cardiac death allowed doctors to use almost all organs except heart, but shorter wait times between removal of ventilator and procedure to procure heart have made it possible for heart transplants as well; some question shorter period and say it is unethical; photos (L)", "print_page": "38", "word_count": 4999, "_id": "4fd2931a8eb7c8105d86d2e4", "snippet": "A new approach to organ donation doesn\u2019t require waiting until the donor\u2019s brain death.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/magazine/20organ-t.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2009/12/20/magazine/20organ-t_CA0/thumbStandard.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2009/12/20/magazine/20organ-t_CA0/thumbStandard.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"width": 600, "url": "images/2009/12/20/magazine/20organ-t_CA0/articleLarge.jpg", "height": 400, "subtype": "xlarge", "legacy": {"xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 400, "xlarge": "images/2009/12/20/magazine/20organ-t_CA0/articleLarge.jpg", "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "HEART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BRAIN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEATH AND DYING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRANSPLANTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOCTORS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOSPITALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SURGERY AND SURGEONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FAMILIES AND FAMILY LIFE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Darshak", "rank": 1, "lastname": "SANGHAVI"}], "original": "By DARSHAK SANGHAVI"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2009-12-20T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 2, "offset": 0, "time": 42}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
