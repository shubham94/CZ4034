In New York, she worked for Manufacturers' Hanover Trust in the Leasing Department. In 1994, she returned to California, this time living closer to daughter Lisa. In Los Angeles, she began a shortlived career as an actress doing several commercials for Hispanic television in particular, including ads for Miller Lite Beer, Cigna Health Insurance and Southwest airlines to name but a few. Clara moved back to New York in early 2000 and after a period of ill health, succumbed to pneumonia. There will not be a viewing.
