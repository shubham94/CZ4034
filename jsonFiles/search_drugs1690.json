It also asked the hospital where he worked to pay back to the Government $122,371 for one project on which he falsified data. The actions by the Federal agency were the harshest it has ever taken in such a case. The Harvard Medical School announced that it had issued new faculty guidelines on how to investigate charges of such fraud. The decision came after a year-long investigation by the National Institutes of Health into the case of Dr. John R. Darsee, a former research fellow at the Brigham and Woman's Hospital, which is affiliated with the medical school. In addition to punishing Dr. Darsee, the Federal investigators criticized supervisory practices in the Brigham laboratory where Dr. Darsee worked. The investigators said these might have contributed ''to the ease with which he was able to produce fabricated data and to the subsequent difficulty in documenting the extent of the problem.'' The supervisors denied that.", "headline": {"main": "U.S. TO PENALIZE HEART RESEARCHER ON FRAUDULENT PROJECT AT HARVARD"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1226, "_id": "4fd12dc78eb7c8105d5f8bd7", "snippet": "The National Institutes of Health moved yesterday to bar a former Harvard Medical School scientist who admitted committing a fraud in heart research from receiving Federal funds for a decade.

That debilitating fear of being successful, which some regarded in the 1970's as particularly prevalent among career-minded women, increasingly appears to be an abiding problem for members of both sexes. Indeed, at times, it seems to afflict almost everyone. Psychiatrists and psychologists say they are still far from understanding all the reasons for fear of success, but they are finding that as a general concept it is proving more and more useful in helping their patients understand themselves. Moreover, they are certain that they see only a small portion of those affected with this syndrome of self-sabotage. ''Just look around,'' says Dr. Jesse O. Cavenar Jr., a professor of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. ''You can see it in your drinking buddies, in your neighbors or in the people you work with.
