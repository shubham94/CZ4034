It was the opposite of most crowd scenes. Here the president was pushing through the ropes to get at the people. He was tired and sweaty, his face infused with crimson. But the swarm of bodies, pressing his way, energized him. He seemed propelled by the heat of their need. Most of the throng -- like most of Brazil -- was throttled by poverty. These thousands in the city of Sobral were dressed in threadbare clothes and mud-covered sandals. Some stood on tiptoes, hoisting small children who squirmed in their arms. Others held tightly to the bicycles they had ridden across the rain-drenched roads. ''Lula, Lula!'' they shouted, relentlessly pushing forward, those closest grasping for the president's sleeve. A small bear of a man, Lula is bearded and round-shouldered with a wide neck and a thick middle. He moved from one person to the next, hugging some and pausing to hear what they had to say, patting the palm of his hand against the side of their faces. ''O-l\u00e9, o-la, Lu-la, Lu-la!'' the crowd began to sing, as if roused to a chant at a soccer game. ''You are a saint!'' cried one barefoot old woman. Her eyes were desperate and bloodshot. She was clutching Lula and wouldn't let go. ''You will help us,'' she said, and as the president bent closer to hear, she bestowed the accolade of the people: ''You are one of us.''", "headline": {"main": "Poor Man's Burden"}, "abstract": "Barry Bearak profiles Pres Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, focusing on challenges he faces improving lives of nation's poor in a post-revolutionary, free-market world; notes that while Lula contnues to talk passionately of feeding Brazil's poor and filling their pockets, his overall strategy has been one of hidebound austerity, cuting back spending; photos (L)", "print_page": "30", "word_count": 7673, "_id": "4fd2a2d18eb7c8105d88848c", "snippet": "Lula, his speech over, waded into the embrace of the masses.
