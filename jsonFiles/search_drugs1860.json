Every year at this time, supplies of donated blood drop to a dangerous low, often forcing communities to halt elective operations temporarily so that enough blood is available to meet emergency needs.

One patient with a bleeding ulcer could quickly exhaust the supply of a large hospital. A major accident, such as a plane crash, could easily wipe out a region's entire stockpile and still not be enough.
