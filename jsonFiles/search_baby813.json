AT 31, WITH FIVE CHILDREN, she's one of the 1.7 million immigrants now estimated to be living in California illegally. She speaks almost no English, even though she has been in America for more than eight years. In her clean and sparsely furnished living room, her kids -- Gustavo (11), Mario (7), Maribel (6), Cesar (5) and Joan (4) -- are in front of the TV, laughing first at \"Home Improvement,\" then at \"The Simpsons.\" The refrigerator is almost empty; it contains only a gallon of milk, some Kool-Aid, a few tortillas. Her life is frugal, a devotion to the future of her children. Though there are three bedrooms in the apartment, all five sleep with her because she hates to let them out of her sight. Since she has no car and can rarely afford the bus, the family walks everywhere, Maria leading the way like Mother Goose with the kids behind toting Batman and Pocahontas backpacks. On a typical day she walks six miles, shuttling between her apartment and the local school in Van Nuys.", "headline": {"main": "What Immigration Crisis?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": 7682, "_id": "4fd1d1bd8eb7c8105d70c81e", "snippet": "MARIA T.
