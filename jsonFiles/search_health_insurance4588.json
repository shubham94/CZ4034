With Senate action expected this week, final passage is possible before lawmakers break for Easter. With a goal of cutting the $300 billion deficit to below $200 billion in four years, the resolution would set firm limits on total spending and taxes. In a sense, though, this is the easy part. A family might calmly decide to put a firm limit on, say, spending for food, but then find it a lot harder to pass by the steak counter and head for the rice and beans. Individual committees must soon climb into the ring to wrestle this beast, trying to translate a sweeping, faceless mandate into a nasty spending cut here, a biting tax increase there. \"The real budget work will be done in the trenches,\" said Representative Robert Michel.
