The protein might help explain why the spread of the virus through saliva is apparently so rare, said the scientists, who were from the National Institute of Dental Research in Bethesda, Md. The protein does not directly attack H.I.V., the AIDS virus. Instead, it seems to act indirectly, by attaching to the surface of white blood cells known as monocytes, thus preventing infection with H.I.V., said Dr. Tessie B. McNeely and Dr. Sharon M. Wahl, the scientific team leaders. They reported the findings at a meeting sponsored by the American Society for Microbiology.", "headline": {"main": "Protein in Saliva Found to Block AIDS Virus in Test Tube Study"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 1407, "_id": "4fd1fdd98eb7c8105d75e3f1", "snippet": "A small protein in human saliva blocks the AIDS virus from infecting human cells in the test tube, Federal scientists reported at a meeting here last week.
