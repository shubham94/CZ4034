The residents of New York are increasingly turning to managed-care health plans, which often charge less and provide more benefits than traditional fee-for-service physicians. But many doctors dislike managed care because these plans closely supervise physician practices and hold down physician income. Unable to win in the market, doctors want the State Legislature to constrain the competition. Legislation pushed by the A.M.A. in New York and many other states would put restrictions on the ability of managed-care plans to hire and fire doctors, thus adding to a health plan's expenses and forcing up premiums by perhaps 20 percent. Worse, the legislation might be interpreted to forbid health plans to restrict patients to a fixed panel of physicians -- the primary tools that managed-care plans use to monitor treatment and contain costs. Indeed, the legislation could make common forms of health maintenance organizations illegal in New York.", "headline": {"main": "An Anti-Patient Act"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "20", "word_count": 270, "_id": "4fd1cc6e8eb7c8105d702a24", "snippet": "Doctors in New York State, backed by the American Medical Association, are lobbying Albany to protect them from losing their patients.
