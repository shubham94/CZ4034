The promotional campaign, together with some unanswered questions about the drug's toxicity, led the Food and Drug Administration for the first time to take regulatory steps against drug company promotional kits and news releases sent to television and radio stations, newspapers and magazines. The F.D.A. reprimanded Lilly in a letter that the agency has released as a warning to other drug makers. When Lilly first marketed Oraflex in the United States last May, the company invested in a costly promotional effort, hoping to capture a large share of the $1-billion-a-year drug market among the 31 million Americans who suffer from arthritis. Oraflex is Lilly's brand name for benoxaprofen, which belongs to a large class called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. More than a dozen such drugs are marketed in the United States, and among them they have been linked to more than 1,000 deaths since 1969, according to the F.D.A. But in its press kits, Lilly claimed that Oraflex had ''different activity from that of other drugs in its class'' and that ''preliminary evidence also suggests that the disease process may be retarded in human patients'' who take one Oraflex pill each day.", "headline": {"main": "BRIEFS ON THE DOCTOR'S WORLD"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 1252, "_id": "4fd1234d8eb7c8105d5e7444", "snippet": "ONE of the most extraordinary campaigns to promote a prescription drug to the public in recent history came to a highly publicized halt this month when Eli Lilly and Company suspended sales of its arthritis drug, Oraflex, from world markets because...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/17/science/briefs-on-the-doctor-s-world.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ADVERTISING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MARKETING AND MERCHANDISING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOCTORS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS AND DRUG TRADE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"qualifier": "M.D", "firstname": "Lawrence", "middlename": "K.", "lastname": "ALTMAN", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By LAWRENCE K.
