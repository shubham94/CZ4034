BROWN, ''Portraits in Jazz, Blues and Other Icons,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through June 29). This three-decade, 30-piece retrospective profiles a painter who has restlessly explored Modernist abstraction, Neo-Expressionist narrative and portraiture. His big, luxuriantly congested, storytelling pictures from the 1980's are the most visually rich and imaginatively expansive. His portraits of great jazz and blues musicians are, at their best, theatrically energetic. But a big double portrait of Willem de Kooning steals the show. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; $3, students and 62+ (Ken Johnson).", "headline": {"main": "ART GUIDE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "36", "word_count": 4222, "_id": "4fd22e178eb7c8105d7bbea3", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend.
