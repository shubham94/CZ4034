Last week she and others in the study received a letter marked ''urgent,'' notifying her that the experiment had been halted a year early, because tamoxifen had shown such a powerful protective effect -- 45 percent fewer cases of breast cancer in the women taking it -- that the scientists felt ethically bound to offer the drug to all the women in the study, some of whom had been assigned to a group that were taking placebos.", "snippet": "WHEN Bernice Olson heard in 1992 that a nationwide study was under way to determine whether the drug tamoxifen could prevent breast cancer in high-risk women, she volunteered right away.
