The analysis by a noted British epidemiologist, Richard Peto, of Oxford University, provoked spirited debate and sharp disagreement when it was presented today at a conference of experts who were brought together by the National Institutes of Health to assess the value of drug therapy in treating breast cancer victims after surgery. The conference is not concerned with the use of drugs to treat tumors that are known to be present, but rather with the use of drugs as a preventive measure to treat patients who may or may not have cancer cells remaining hidden in the body. A panel of experts is scheduled to present its conclusions on the value of such therapies at the conclusion of the conference on Wednesday.", "headline": {"main": "BREAST CANCER ANALYSIS STIRS A DEBATE AT PARLEY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "word_count": 646, "_id": "4fd151a58eb7c8105d6335ae", "snippet": "A provocative new analysis of more than 100 clinical trials involving 36,000 women around the world has concluded that relatively mild hormonal therapy is more effective than toxic drugs in preventing recurrence of fatal breast cancer in women over...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/11/us/breast-cancer-analysis-stirs-a-debate-at-parley.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "PETO, RICHARD"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "GREAT BRITAIN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HORMONES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BREAST"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CANCER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WOMEN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS AND DRUG TRADE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By PHILIP M.
