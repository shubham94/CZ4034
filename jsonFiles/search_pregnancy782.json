An official close to him said that Mr. Olmert did not want the political machine to trump the legal one, and believed it would become clear during the inquest that he had done nothing wrong. Page A10 THE GERMAN MILK PARTY? The Federation of European Dairy Farmers estimates that, on Wednesday alone, 10.6 million gallons of milk were dumped in a boycott by European dairy farmers. Why? While food prices have soared, the price of milk has not, in part because the European Union has raised quotas but not prices. As the price of milk fell, prices of fuel and feed rose. But cows keep producing and will sicken if not milked, so dairy farmers will keep working, and dumping, as long as the boycott lasts. Page A6 THE LAST DAYS OF NEPAL'S MONARCHY Nepal's 239-year-long monarchy neared its end, as a newly elected assembly told Gyanendra, king of Nepal, to step down from his throne in 15 days. The assembly is led by former Maoist guerrillas who emerged from the jungle after 10 years of war and traded gunplay for politics. They also demanded an end to the monarchy. Winning more than a third of Parliament's 601 seats, they hold a majority position and the party's leader is expected to take over as prime minister. Those suspected of remaining loyal to the monarchy have spoken by detonating small bombs in Katmandu. Page A8 SOUTH AFRICA WEIGHS SHELTER PLAN Waves of xenophobic violence have been visited against immigrants in South Africa, leading them to flee the impoverished squatter areas they had been living in. Relief organizations have proposed shelters intended as a temporary solution that could house as many as 70,000, but have been delayed pending a government decision. Doubts have been raised about South Africa's ability to run them, and international agencies fear that the camps could become rife with conflicts and sexual violence. Page A12 NATIONAL A PARTIAL PICTURE Of Carbon Footprints A new study by the Brookings Institution rating energy use showed, in general, smaller carbon footprints for the West Coast, with the Honolulu area ranked No. 1 followed by the area including Los Angeles and Orange Counties in California, the Portland-Vancouver area in the Northwest and the New York metropolitan area. At the bottom: a cluster of rust-belt urban areas including Cincinnati; Indianapolis; Lexington, Ky.; and Toledo, Ohio. PAGE A21 A PLAN FOR THE OCEANS With numerous projects being proposed for the waters off its shores, Massachusetts is now the first state to have a framework for a protection plan for its ocean waters. It sets ground rules for all offshore projects and businesses, including energy ventures and conservation areas that lie within three miles of the coast. PAGE A15 FINDING THE TABLES TURNED As President Bush's press secretary, Scott McClellan was part of the apparatus used by the White House to take on Mr. Bush's critics. Having departed that job, and with a new book that now casts him as one of those critics, Mr. McClellan is learning that the apparatus still functions without him. PAGE A14 CARE FOR THOSE WHO GIVE CARE The Army has begun to recognize that the war in Iraq is taking a toll not only on the troops, but also on those who counsel those troops, the chaplains. None have been killed, but some have been wounded, some in ways that cannot be seen. ''I've been really pushed to my limits and beyond,'' one said. ''At times, I've really wondered if I could get through.'' PAGE A19 SECT MOTHERS SPEAK OUT As the highest court in Texas prepares to rule on whether child welfare authorities had the right to take 468 children from a ranch early last month, the mothers are trying to make their case with the public by speaking out more forcefully about the harm they think the separation has already done to their children. PAGE A14 BUSINESS WITH FURTHER MERGERS UNLIKELY, Airlines Face Making Own Cuts Mergers other than the already-announced deal between Delta and Northwest seem unlikely, so airlines seeking to offset rising fuel prices are likely to cut costs, cut routes and park planes without the camouflage that a merger would have provided. And that means that the grumbling will come through unfiltered. PAGE C1 EXXON CHALLENGE DEFEATED Exxon Mobil's chairman and chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, defeated a shareholder effort supported by many members of the Rockefeller family that would have divided the chairman and chief executive positions. The vote was at an annual meeting punctuated by a debate of the company's policy toward renewable energy and global warming and, though nonbinding, would have been a serious rebuke. PAGE C3 NATURAL GAS RISING LIKE GASOLINE A longstanding assumption of American energy policy -- that natural gas will be plentiful abroad, and therefore readily available for importation, as production falls off in North America -- is being challenged as the supertankers that were supposed to deliver cargoes of gas from Africa and the Middle East to the United States are taking them to places like Spain and Japan instead. PAGE C1 LIFE VALUES IN THE CORPORATE WORLD Students who join Stewart Friedman's management class at the Wharton business school commit to sharing intimate details with their classmates about their most important relationships. And though that may not sound like the stuff of business school education, Mr. Friedman and others have tapped into a desire by both students and established entrepreneurs for more integration of their careers and personal lives. PAGE C5 Strength in Durable Goods econ C4 METRO EXERCISER'S LOUD NOISES Lead to Assault Trial Stuart Sugarman adjusted the stationary bicycle for his frame, clicked his specialty cycling shoes into the pedals and, when spinning class started, began the most conspicuous part of his ritual: his loud noises. Christopher Carter, who was two bikes down, took issue with the noises. Now a trial in Manhattan Criminal Court is to determine whether what Mr. Carter did to stop Mr. Sugarman from making those noises qualifies as assault. PAGE A25 DEFENDING A PERK Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York says giving members of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's board free E-ZPasses to drive across its bridges and tunnels without paying tolls, as well as passes to ride the subways, buses and commuter railroads without paying, violates a state law requiring that members serve without compensation. The authority disagrees, and plans to go to court to fight for the perk. PAGE A24 STYLES STILL TURNING A PROFIT In Fashion's Fast Lane One survey this month found more than half the respondents saying they planned to spend less on apparel; another found almost a third of people reporting ''severe anxiety'' about their personal finances. All of which can be good news, it seems, if you happen to be in the fast-fashion business. ''The least vulnerable brands now are the ones at the lower end of the luxury market and the upper end of the midtier market,'' one analyst said. PAGE E1 YOGA FOR THE MASSES The explosion in popularity of yoga has been good news for novices looking for classes -- there is seemingly one on every corner, and maybe another upstairs. But for the advanced student looking for something a little -- or a lot -- more challenging, the result is not so good. In seeking to be accessible to the many, classes become less desirable for the few. PAGE E10 FEEL THE STRETCH, AVOID THE MARK Various concoctions are marketing as being able to prevent stretch marks resulting from pregnancy. Can they? The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says no. But the American Pregnancy Association suggests that women can reduce the probability of stretch marks (the key word being ''probability''). But be aware that genetics and race play a role in stretch marks, too. skin PAGE E3 NO ORDINARY JOE This sort of thing used to be reserved for wines, but beers have gotten into the act, along with single malt scotches. And so it follows that coffee tastings -- known to aficionados as cuppings -- now appear, at which the devoted might pay $20 each to taste three coffees, each from a different country. Take along a sophisticated palate if you want to pick up the hints of basil and jasmine. PAGE E6 SPORTS AT 17, READY TO RUN Against Sport's Elite Chanelle Price is a high school senior with some typical items on her to-do list this time of year: finish writing two papers, take two final exams. She also has one most unusual item: run the 800 meters at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore., on June 8. From there, who knows, maybe the Olympics in Beijing. PAGE C12 WHEN IT WENT TO THE WIRE The occasion of this year's run at horse racing's Triple Crown cannot help calling forth memories of the last one, 30 years ago, when two outstanding horses not only faced off in each of the three races but also finished 1-2 in each of them. ''Seen through the current prism of fragile, transient champions, Affirmed and Alydar seem from another planet, another age, another breed,'' George Vecsey writes in Sports of The Times. PAGE C14 HOME FINDING AN ALTERNATIVE To That Chlorine Smell For those who want -- or have -- a swimming pool, but do not want the smell and possible other side effects of a chlorine sanitation system, other options exist. Pool installers may not tell you about them, and they are not cheap, but for some people they are a must. ''Our target audience is the person who shops at Whole Foods,'' said one installer. PAGE F1 PUTTING DOWN (SHALLOW) ROOTS Move often enough, Peter Moore says, and ''you realize quickly how you are burdened by your past, and so you become a ruthless editor.'' And Mr. Moore, an architect and developer, and his wife, Kathryn Lynch, a painter, have moved often enough. But they've been in the same place for three years now: the top floor of an 1890s brick warehouse on Washington Street. ''Our semipermanent home,'' he calls it. PAGE F5 Shopping for Newlyweds F4 OBITUARIES DAVID GAHR, 85 He turned his back on a promising career as a scholar to take pictures and listen to music and as a result landed among the pre-eminent photographers of American folk, blues, jazz and rock musicians of the 1960s and beyond. PAGE C11 SOPHIE B. ALTMAN, 95 In 1961 she started a television quiz show for precocious high school students, later added pep bands and cheerleaders and was as surprised as anybody when the show, ''It's Academic,'' became the world's longest-running quiz show. PAGE C11 ARTS ABC IN ANCHOR TALKS With Charles Gibson ABC passed over Charles Gibson in 2005 as anchor of ''World News,'' but events put him in the job anyway, success followed, and now he is in talks to stay there for the foreseeable future. Does he want to? ''I honestly don't know,'' he says. One person who must be anxiously waiting the outcome is Diane Sawyer, whose future probably is linked to the result. PAGE B1 AN ETHICS DISCLAIMER The media reporter (and sometimes ethics arbiter) Howard Kurtz invited Kimberly Dozier, the CBS journalist wounded in Iraq, onto his program on CNN on Sunday to talk about her memoir, ''Breathing the Fire.'' After the interview, he revealed that his wife had ''done some promotion work'' for the book. He and his employers see no problem with that. Some media ethicists do. PAGE B3 'LOST' LEADING THE LOST Even committed viewers of the ABC series ''Lost'' might be forgiven for not being able to follow every twist of its anarchic plot or not being aware of the relevance -- even the existence -- of the many obscure allusions made. And anyone who has looked even briefly at ''Lost'' blogs knows that some people are trying way too hard. Season Four concludes tonight. PAGE B1 Gliding Through Space B5 EDITORIAL IN DEFENSE OF WORKERS The Supreme Court upheld the rights of employees who charge age and race discrimination. Perhaps the justices realized that Americans want a court that does not stack the deck for the powerful. Or, they may simply be getting better at respecting precedent. PAGE A26 I KNEW IT ALL ALONG A new memoir by President Bush's former press secretary, Scott McClellan, could be named: ''I Knew It Was a Terrible Mistake, but I Didn't Mention It Until I Got a Book Contract.'' PAGE A26 NEW JERSEY PRIMARY CHOICES The Editorial Board endorses Frank Lautenberg for the Democratic Senate primary and former Representative Richard Zimmer for the Republican race. Republicans should pick Leonard Lance for the Seventh Congressional District. PAGE A26 OP-ED NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF Does Islamic terrorism threaten this year's Olympic Games? The Chinese authorities have warned of terror plots emanating from the mostly Muslim region of Xinjiang. On a trip to the ancient Silk Road oasis of Kashgar, signs abound of the authorities' anxiety about stability in China's Muslim west. PAGE A27 GAIL COLLINS South Dakota, along with Montana, is going to have the Last Primary on Tuesday. When you live in a reliably red state with only three electoral votes and no real fund-raising potential, it takes being overlooked in the presidential races to a whole new level. The people here, like Hillary, can use a good moment.
