American and British researchers have found that the protection seems to last as a long as a decade after a woman stops taking the pill. The findings, pointing to an extraordinary instance in which a drug appears to prevent cancer, are only part of the evidence suggesting that the pill, although not entirely free of hazard, has wide-ranging health benefits. A review of the recent medical literature shows that other unexpected effects of the pill range from reduced incidence of irondeficiency anemia to pelvic inflammation to, perhaps, rheumatoid arthritis.", "headline": {"main": "HEALTH BENEFITS OF THE PILL FOUND TO OUTWEIGH ITS DRAWBACKS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2137, "_id": "4fd1234f8eb7c8105d5e7616", "snippet": "IN sharp contrast to early fears, the birth control pill does not appear to cause any cancer, according to recent research, and, in fact, evidently protects many women from getting cancers, particularly those of the ovaries and of the lining of the...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/13/science/health-benefits-of-the-pill-found-to-outweigh-its-drawbacks.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CANCER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIRTH CONTROL AND FAMILY PLANNING"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Lawrence", "middlename": "K.", "lastname": "ALTMAN", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By LAWRENCE K.
