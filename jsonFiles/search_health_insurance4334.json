The Republicans are rushing through Congress the greatest attempt in modern history to reward the wealthy at the expense of the poor. They are also sacrificing the health needs of the elderly to pay for a tax cut for the affluent. Incredibly, Mr. Gingrich was accusing the Democrats of fomenting class and generational resentments by pointing this out. President Clinton can do no less than veto the Republican legislative package that is roaring toward passage in Congress. We have long argued that Medicare, the health insurance program for elderly Americans, is in need of reform. Many Republican ideas for introducing competition into the health care system and forcing providers to deliver care more efficiently are sound. But the cuts being pushed through Congress are so big they threaten to dry up money for medical training, devastate nursing homes and drive hospitals and doctors away from taking care of Medicare patients. Right now, Medicare makes up less than 12 percent of the Federal budget. But Medicare cuts account for more than twice that percentage of the lower spending in the Republican-approved budgets over the next seven years. Notwithstanding Mr. Gingrich's appeal, the facts clearly demonstrate that health programs for the elderly are bearing a disproportionate share of the austerity pushed by the Republicans.", "headline": {"main": "Class Conflict in Washington"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": 776, "_id": "4fd202dc8eb7c8105d768c61", "snippet": "How touching it was for House Speaker Newt Gingrich to appeal for brotherly love at the end of the titanic debate over Medicare last week. \"We want no class warfare,\" he declared. \"We want no conflict between generations.\" Even by Mr. Gingrich's...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/22/opinion/class-conflict-in-washington.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "NEWT GINGRICH"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MEDICARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BUDGETS AND BUDGETING"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1995-10-22T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}], "meta": {"hits": 33, "offset": 30, "time": 30}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
