''The sick, twisted little bean counter who came up with the health maintenance organization.'' As a prickly but secretly noble physician who spouts outrageous truths, Ted Danson's John Becker is no more believable than the saintly Marcus Welby was. But here, in a promotional spot for the new CBS sitcom ''Becker,'' he sounds oddly realistic, echoing opinions heard more and more often, on and off television. Under the heading ''Becker on H.M.O.'s,'' the harangue continues: ''You go in with a headache; they do a credit scan before a CAT scan. Need surgery? They biopsy your wallet. H.M.O.'s, you know what H.M.O.'s stand for? Have money or die.'' More astute than the labored series itself, the promo sounds a theme that medical dramas have also leaped on this season. ''Chicago Hope,'' ''E.R.'' and the new ''L.A. Doctors'' have all included more than one major story pointedly attacking H.M.O.'s. The shows reflect the widespread image of H.M.O.'s as faceless, heartless monoliths that would rather save a penny than save a life.
