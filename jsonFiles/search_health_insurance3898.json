At least 150 people have died. A1 German Rejects Offer Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroder's choice for Economics Minister, Jost Stollmann, turned down the position. The rejection is the strongest sign that the incoming Government will be more left-wing than pragmatic.

The move is an indication that the new Government may be willing to help set up a compensation fund.

A final vote is scheduled for today. A1 Backlash as an Issue A Democratic poll found that Jay Inslee, a Democrat in Washington State running for the House, had gained ground since he became the first, and only, Democrat in a tight race to run a commercial criticizing his opponent for voting for a broad impeachment inquiry. A24 More Jones Case Documents A Federal judge in Little Rock, Ark., made public hundreds of pages of documents from the Paula Corbin Jones lawsuit against President Clinton. Ms. Jones's lawyers will ask an appeals court today to reinstate her suit, which the District Court dismissed on April 1.

D'Amato got inserted into an appropriations bill that passed two weeks ago. Eight companies that control the mortgage insurance business object to the measure.
