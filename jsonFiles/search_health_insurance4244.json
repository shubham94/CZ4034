{"status": "OK", "response": {"docs": [{"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk;", "lead_paragraph": "Murray Klavens, 72, a retired manager at a semiconductor company who lives in Hicksville, L.I., says he knows a rip-off when he sees one. And that's what long-term care insurance policies were when they came out in the late 1980's, he says. \"They were much more expensive, they offered a lot less in home-care benefits, and your assets were still at risk\" in case of an extended illness, he says. But in June 1993, Mr. Klavens found a much-improved policy and began paying $2,709 a year for it. The about-face is being repeated across the country as long-term care policies get a second look. For a number of reasons -- including proposed cuts in government health care -- the policies are more appealing than a few years ago, when they were widely dismissed as too expensive and too limited. Long-term policies \"are something I now tell everyone of my clients to look at,\" said Peter J. Strauss, a fellow of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys and a partner with the New York law firm of Epstein Becker & Green. For starters, the new policies have fewer restrictions and include more types of care than before. Policies may extend well beyond nursing home care to home care, adult day care and assisted living in senior housing. Rather than requiring a doctor's certification, the policies will now pay if a social worker, physical therapist or other professional health care provider confirms that the policyholder needs help with one or two daily functions or has some mental impairment. Another reason for increased interest is that the Federal Government and the states are threatening to cut back on health care programs because of budget concerns. One program that is a target for cuts in New York, for example, provides assistance to the homebound and the disabled, who may rely on such services to live independently and who say their only alternative may be a nursing home. When health care revision looked likely a year ago, financial advisers urged their clients to put long-term care policies on the back burner. But such legislation ran out of steam in Congress, and virtually no one expects an overhaul of the health care system anytime soon. Congress did take action, though, to make it harder for the elderly to claim poverty and qualify for nursing home coverage through Medicaid, a combination Federal and state program for the poor. Medicare, a Federal-state program for the elderly, covers short-term nursing home needs after a hospital stay, but, depending on the state, stops payment at about 30 days. With nursing home costs running more than $100 a day, spending all one's assets for nursing home care is a very real possibility. Depleting one's assets is perhaps the greatest financial fear of the elderly, who often hope to leave a home or other hard-earned investment to their children. To address this concern, California, Connecticut, Indiana and New York have teamed up with public agencies to create long-term care policies that protect assets. These states offer policies that guarantee not to deplete assets for long-term care even after the policy's benefits are exhausted. No matter how improved, long-term care policies are not for everyone. Norma M. Severns, a certified financial planner with Armstrong, Welch & MacIntyre in Washington, and an elder-care specialist, finds long-term care policies most suitable for the middle class. Someone with $1 million in investments is likely to have income that could cover nursing home and similar bills, she said. And someone who has less than $100,000 in assets and $20,000 in income may find annual premiums of $1,500 or more too costly and could wind up depleting assets for nursing home insurance. As a rule of thumb, \"long-term care premiums should never exceed 10 percent of income,\" Ms. Severns said. The prime candidate for a long-term care policy is someone 50 to 60 years old. For those older, premiums rise sharply. A policy that costs $1,000 annually if taken out at age 55 might cost $3,000 at age 70. Buyers should look for a policy that is renewable for life and that cannot be canceled for any reason other than failure to pay premiums, which should remain level over the policy's life. Waiting until after retirement to buy a policy can lead to another problem as well. With age, the chances increase of being rejected because of a medical condition, like a stroke, Parkinson's disease or fading vision. \"Sign up while you're still young and healthy,\" Mr. Strauss advised. Mr. Klavens said kidney problems that had developed since he bought a policy would probably disqualify him if he were trying to find coverage today. Mr. Klavens bought his policy through the New York State Partnership for Long-Term Care (800 633-3088). Should the benefits be exhausted, after three years of nursing home bills for example, policyholders have to contribute only current income to pay their care bills. Medicaid will pay the remainder, no matter what the policyholder's assets. That promise was the deciding factor for Mr. Klavens, who has an individual retirement account of more than $100,000 and a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. \"I didn't like the idea that my assets might still be dissipated,\" he said, if he needed care for longer than three years or exhausted the $164,000 maximum benefit on his policy. Ruth Loeb, 74, of Manhattan, said she bought a policy to help protect her two daughters and five grandchildren. \"I want to have something left for them,\" Ms. Loeb said. Under the New York partnership program, the minimum amount of coverage is three years of long-term care in a nursing home at $105 a day or six years of support services in the home at $52 a day, or some combination. Because the average nursing home stay is less than three years, Ms. Severns said, the state aims to reduce its costs by encouraging more people to start out with private insurance instead of Medicare and Medicaid. As an inducement, it picks up any additional costs when the insurance benefits are exhausted. Connecticut, California and Indiana offer what they call \"dollar for dollar\" protection of assets in their long-term care insurance programs. If someone buys a policy that will pay $100 a day for three years, or a total of $109,500, that person could keep an equivalent amount of assets and still qualify for Medicaid to cover bills at the end of the three years. Joan Quinn, who is president of Connecticut Community Care, a care management concern, said she had seen \"how little is covered by regular insurance if you stay at home.\" So a year ago she bought a policy through Connecticut's partnership program (203 424-4943). Because she bought in her 50's, Ms. Quinn pays $1,200 a year for $100,000 of comprehensive coverage, meaning she can pass $100,000 on to her heirs without Medicaid making a claim on those assets. Within states, premiums may vary considerably by insurer. In New York, annual premiums for a 60-year-old who takes out a policy that offers $105 in daily nursing home benefits and begins to pay after a 100-day waiting period ranged from $945 at the John Alden Life Insurance Company to $1,655 at the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association. Rates from several insurers are published in a booklet titled \"Insurance Policies Covering Long-Term Care Services in New York State.\" A free copy is available from the New York State Insurance Department, Publications Unit, Empire State Plaza, Agency Building #1, Albany, N.Y. 12257. Trying to maximize coverage may be a mistake, health care advisers say. Three to five years of long-term care is usually sufficient, and buying more may make premiums unaffordable. Extending the waiting period before coverage begins is one way to reduce premiums. A waiting period of 20 days is considered a good compromise, Ms. Severns said, though up to 100 days is possible. Only if the premiums are truly unaffordable, she said, should people consider a longer waiting period. For anyone who bought a policy several years ago, elder-care experts recommend asking the insurer to modify the policy to include a wider range of care. Even a few years in age can make a big difference in premiums and makes starting from scratch untenable.", "headline": {"main": "Comeback for Long-Term Care Policies"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "35", "word_count": 1373, "_id": "4fd1c6788eb7c8105d6f7abd", "snippet": "Murray Klavens, 72, a retired manager at a semiconductor company who lives in Hicksville, L.I., says he knows a rip-off when he sees one.
