As it turned out, each patient was infected by an organ or tissue -- a kidney, a liver, an artery -- that he or she received in a transplant several weeks earlier. Their shared donor, William Beed Jr., a young brain-dead man, had rabies, caught apparently through a bite from a rabid bat, something the surgeons never suspected. They all thought he had suffered a fatal crack-cocaine overdose, which can produce symptoms similar to those of rabies. ''We had an explanation for his condition,'' says Dr. Goran Klintmalm, a surgeon who oversees transplantation at Baylor University Medical Center, where the transplants occurred. ''He'd recently smoked crack cocaine. He'd hemorrhaged around the brain. He'd died. That was all we needed to know.'' Since the rabies deaths, recriminations have flown, procedural reviews have begun and sorrow and regret have dogged the families of the organ recipients. But the outbreak also exposed a controversy that until then was roiling only the rarefied world of transplant specialists. The issue, although freighted with monetary and bio-ethical complexities, can be boiled down to one deceptively simple question. Should transplant surgeons be using organs from nearly anyone?", "snippet": "Transplant surgeons are increasingly using organs from bad donors. But with little known for certain about the consequences, doctors are confronting complex medical and ethical questions."}], "meta": {"offset": 0, "hits": 1, "time": 33}}}
