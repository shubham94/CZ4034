''Public Housing,'' the latest landmark documentary from Frederick Wiseman, sustains Mr. Wiseman's clear-eyed objectivity, a simple but uncanny means of immersing an audience in the world that the camera studies. But in his anatomy of the Ida B. Wells housing project on Chicago's South Side, Mr. Wiseman allows himself one faint bit of editorializing. Several times during the course of this monumental 3-hour-and-20-minute community portrait, Mr. Wiseman lets the viewer notice an ice cream truck that cruises this grim neighborhood and listen as it tootles absurdly cheery nursery songs (e.g. ''Pop Goes the Weasel''). For the 5,000 residents of Ida B. Wells, how can this mean anything but a false promise or a cruel joke?", "headline": {"main": "As Life Unfolds at a Housing Project", "kicker": "FILM REVIEW"}, "abstract": "Excerpts from Janet Maslin review of Frederick Wiseman documentary Public Housing, which was shown at 1997 New York Film Festival and is now opening in Manhattan (M)", "print_page": "5", "word_count": 497, "_id": "4fd205428eb7c8105d76da71", "snippet": "''Public Housing'' was shown as part of last year's New York Film Festival.
