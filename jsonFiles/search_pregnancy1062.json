While I believe that dads should actively participate in every aspect of their children's lives and their partners' pregnancies, there's still something totally absurd about the idea of the ''couple's shower.'' It was Regina who had the ''Baby Bargains'' book. She knew what she wanted and what we needed, and her judgment served as Talmud in our house. My only priority was hanging up a poster of Johnny Cash in the nursery. The shower was held poolside on an oppressively muggy August day in Regina's mother's backyard, which overlooked a golf course.
