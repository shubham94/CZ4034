But while customers continue to pour out their woes at neighborhood pubs, at least in California they aren't smoking while they do it. The state banned smoking in bars as of last Jan. 1. Recognizing an opportunity, a team of University of California at San Francisco researchers took advantage of this natural experiment to investigate the respiratory health of bartenders before and after the law went into effect. The results, published in the most recent issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, indicate that even a month to two months of daily toil in an environment newly free of secondhand smoke can cause a significant reduction in symptoms like coughing, eye and nose irritation and phlegm production, as well as some improvement in lung function.", "snippet": "In the line of duty, bartenders are exposed to more than their share of other people's troubles -- and other people's cigarette smoke.
