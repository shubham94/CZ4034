Constant and exaggerated warnings about an obesity epidemic, they say, are causing ''fatism'' and ''sizeism,'' discrimination against those who are overweight. As evidence the authors note that people who are obese tend to earn less money and marry less frequently than their thinner counterparts, and that women are most frequently affected. Ms. Kwan and Ms. Trautner maintain that someone can be fit and fat, and that public-health officials ''exacerbate sizeism'' by their repeated messages that being overweight increases the risk of a series of diseases including cancer and diabetes.", "snippet": "In ''Weighty Concerns,'' by Samantha Kwan and Mary Nell Trautner, in the spring 2011 issue of Contexts, the magazine of the American Sociological Association, the authors complain that Americans are in the thrall of a ''moral panic'' about weight....", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "TRAUTNER, MARY NELL", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "KWAN, SAMANTHA", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "CONTEXTS", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "OBESITY", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "4", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 304, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}, {"news_desk": null, "document_type": "blogpost", "_id": "4fd3a0418eb7c8105d8e56ba", "headline": {"kicker": "ArtsBeat", "main": "Thinking Cap: The Weight Panic"}, "pub_date": "2011-07-12T11:30:38Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"original": "By PATRICIA COHEN", "person": [{"lastname": "COHEN", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Patricia", "organization": "", "role": "reported"}]}, "abstract": "Along with the familiar criticisms of the culture\u2019s obsession with thinness, Ms. Kwan and Ms. Trautner would like to see Congress pass a law that bans discrimination against fat people.", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/12/thinking-cap-the-weight-panic/", "section_name": "Arts", "lead_paragraph": "Thinking Cap offers reports from the world of ideas.", "snippet": "Along with the familiar criticisms of the culture\u2019s obsession with thinness, Ms. Kwan and Ms. Trautner would like to see Congress pass a law that bans discrimination against fat people.", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "value": "News", "name": "type_of_material"}, {"rank": "2", "value": "Obama, Michelle", "name": "persons"}, {"rank": "3", "value": "Medicine and Health", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "4", "value": "Obesity", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "5", "value": "American Sociological Assn", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "6", "value": "House of Representatives", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "7", "value": "Senate", "name": "organizations"}], "print_page": null, "type_of_material": "Blog", "word_count": "335", "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}, {"news_desk": "Science", "document_type": "article", "_id": "540fa37c7988101387749e34", "headline": {"content_kicker": "Vital Signs", "seo": "Wait to Restart Birth Control Pills, C.D.C.
