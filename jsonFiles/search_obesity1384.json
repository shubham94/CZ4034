The secret of its success was that the Government picked up much of the tab for these expensive treatments through Medicare. The company's revenues swelled, from $30 million in 1973 to $245.5 million in 1980, and its 140 outpatient clinics make it the nation's largest company offering hemodialysis treatments. Now, National Medical Care is facing uncertainties that has sent its stock in a tailspin. Growth is limited, of course, by the number of people requiring such treatment. Beyond that, the company is feeling the bite of Government cutbacks. The once burgeoning hemodialysis industry, which like many other industries grew and depends on public funding, is threatened as costs rise and the Government maintains a fixed reimbursement rate, unchanged since 1973. In addition, language that appears to require the establishment of a dual rate favorable to general hospitals offering hemodialysis was quietly slipped into the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. The measure seeks to ''encourage the more efficient delivery of dialysis services,'' and the private companies such as National Medical Care see it as allowing the general hospitals to raise their fees while lowering or putting a cap on their own. The Health Care Financing Administration will soon implement the law by publishing a new Medicare rate.", "snippet": "N ATIONAL MEDICAL CARE INC. made its fortune in outpatient centers for treating kidney failure with machines that artificially purify the blood.
