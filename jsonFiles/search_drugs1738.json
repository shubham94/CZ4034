It was sanctioned behavior, based on a belief central to his culture: Any contact a man had with menstrual blood -or even with a menstruating woman - would, as one anthropologist put it, ''corrupt his vital juices, permanently dull his wits and eventually lead to slow death.'' The world has come a long way from such excess, but that is not to say the journey is complete. The vagaries of present-day attitudes toward menstruation can be charted by the shifting definition of menstrual distress. Twenty-five years ago, menstruation was considered a disability that hampered a woman's performance on the job and in the bedroom - it was irrefutable proof of female inferiority. Fifteen years ago, the women's movement sought to dispel such stereotyping, insisting that women were capable of holding their own in the marketplace no matter what the time of the month might be. Today, a new consensus is taking shape: Those women who suffer from severe menstrual distress are seen as suffering from a physiological disorder. This hormonal imbalance affects a small minority of women - up to 10 percent, by most estimates - causing them problems that may warrant a physician's intervention.", "headline": {"main": "DISPELLING MENSTRUAL MYTHS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "64", "word_count": 4760, "_id": "4fd11d7e8eb7c8105d5dbbbe", "snippet": "When a New Guinea tribesman found his wife lying on his blanket at the time of her menstruation, he divorced her.
