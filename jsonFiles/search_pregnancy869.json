Based on Kenneth Grahame's children's book about a few anthropomorphized members of the animal kingdom, this adaptation stars Bob Hoskins and the British comedian Matt Lucas, among others. Just like ''The Sopranos,'' the story features a scalawag son of great wealth, but his name isn't Anthony Jr. It's Mr. Toad. Also returning for a new season Sunday is ''ENTOURAGE'' (HBO, at 10 p.m.). Ari has been fired as Vince's agent. Replacing him now is another young power agent, Amanda (Carla Gugino), who wants Vince to break out of the box, play against type. What is her idea for him exactly? A costume drama based on an Edith Wharton novel. (What fun Wharton would have had with the codes and excesses of young millennial-era celebrity!) If you have had it with urbanites in their 30s, obsessing about conception, pregnancy, baby nurses and Lamaze classes, and if you just can't help feeling wistful for the days when young marrieds just drank too much and cheated, then tread cautiously toward the premiere of ''NOTES FROM THE UNDERBELLY'' on Thursday (ABC, 10 p.m.), directed by the filmmaker Barry Sonnenfeld. The series makes a fetish of everything prenatal. An exercise in Gucci-free earnestness, ''THE BRICK AWARDS,'' to be broadcast on Thursday (CW, 9 p.m.), honors young adults who have done something good for the world in public health, environmental preservation and other fields.
