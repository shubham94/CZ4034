But faced with women's growing interest in exercise and sports and their desire to stay in shape while a new life takes shape within them, doctors gave exercise during pregnancy a second look. And to the surprise of many, medical research has shown that most women can safely continue to exercise throughout pregnancy, as long as they make some sensible adjustments to their routines.

Mr. Mandal says his runs are now more effective because he has an easy and accurate way to gauge his workout intensity. To help exercisers avoid either overdoing or underdoing it, experts advise establishing a target training zone: 50 to 90 percent of maximum heart rate, the fastest your heart is capable of beating. (A quick way to estimate maximum heart rate is to subtract your age from 220; thus, if you are 40, your maximum rate is about 180 and your target training zone is 90 to 162 beats a minute.
