What they will see on April 9 is a stunning physical and technological achievement. The 777, the largest twin-engine plane ever built, sports the biggest, most powerful aircraft engines ever made -- the housing around each is as wide as the fuselage of a 737 or 757. Designed entirely on computer screens and assembled without mockups, it is the first \"paperless\" jetliner. And because it has just two engines, and needs only two pilots, it should cost 25 percent less to operate than older models of the four-engine 747, which it is meant to eventually replace. Just 22 feet shorter than the 747, the new plane can carry up to 440 passengers, as many as some 747's. And while its range is now about 4,600 miles, that will go up to 7,250 miles before long, matching the 747.", "headline": {"main": "Can Boeing's New Baby Fly Financially?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2952, "_id": "4fd1bf998eb7c8105d6ed722", "snippet": "IN two weeks, tens of thousands of people will crowd onto a cavernous factory floor here, 25 miles north of Seattle, to watch the Boeing Company introduce its new wide-body jetliner, the 777.
