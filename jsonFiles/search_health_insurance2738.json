It requires certain large grocers to provide health care benefits for their employees. The law -- like a handful of similar efforts from Long Island to San Francisco -- is a response to the growing strain on Medicaid and other government assistance programs from uninsured workers. A major inspiration for the legislation is clearly Wal-Mart. One report showed that nearly 9,000 Wal-Mart workers needed public insurance in Wisconsin, and that more than 10,000 children of the store's workers in Georgia were treated at taxpayer expense. The list goes on.
