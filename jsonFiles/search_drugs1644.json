Green bought a psychiatric hospital south of San Francisco, intending to use the site for an apartment complex. But after studying his acquisition, Mr. Green stuck with the hospital. It proved to be a good decision. Today, Mr. Green, an accountant by training, is chairman of Community Psychiatric Centers, which now owns 25 psychiatric hospitals in 12 states and Britain and has achieved a reputation as the most profitable psychiatric hospital chain in the nation.
