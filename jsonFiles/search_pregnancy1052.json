Als understands, as much as anyone, that premature infants are fragile creatures and that even the smallest noise or disruption can overload their still-developing plum-size brains. Stepping gently, she led me to a tiny boy lying on his back in a plastic bed no bigger than a briefcase. He was surrounded by a tangled nest of wires, tubes and hoses, a respirator and other lifesaving devices. As we watched, a nurse arrived and fumbled with an IV needle; she grabbed one of the baby's tiny, almost translucent heels and stretched his leg in the air to give herself room to work. The baby tried to retract his leg. He started to cry. The nurse glanced at Als and then pushed the needle into the heel. Als winced. The nurse couldn't find a vein. She pulled the other leg, tried that heel and failed again. The baby cried harder. Als cupped her hands over her mouth; she knew she shouldn't interfere, but she had trouble restraining herself. A second nurse came and put her hands on the baby's chest to keep him from squirming. Als walked away. She couldn't watch any longer.", "headline": {"main": "A Second Womb"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "37", "word_count": 4078, "_id": "4fd25c858eb7c8105d80a689", "snippet": "Will a Harvard psychologist succeed in her efforts to re-engineer the neonatal intensive-care unit and reduce the price of prematurity?", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/14/magazine/14PREEMIE.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "imagepages/2005/08/10/magazine/14prem.2.html", "rank": "2", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupHeight2": "325", "MultimediaUrl2": "imagepages/2005/08/10/magazine/14prem.2.html", "MultimediaPopupWidth2": "250", "MultimediaType2": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "imagepages/2005/08/10/magazine/14prem.1.html", "rank": "1", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupWidth1": "250", "MultimediaUrl1": "imagepages/2005/08/10/magazine/14prem.1.html", "MultimediaPopupHeight1": "325", "MultimediaType1": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "images/2005/08/10/magazine/14prem.1.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/08/10/magazine/14prem.1.75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55, "height": 55}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BRAZELTON, T BERRY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BABIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REPRODUCTION (BIOLOGICAL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Paul", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Raeburn"}], "original": "By Paul Raeburn"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-08-14T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Magazine"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Sports Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Congratulations abounded for Ron Philo Jr. yesterday after he made the cut at the P.G.A.
