President Francois Mitterrand suggested that Washington should provide more support for the third world, while President Reagan stressed his goals of a smaller Government and a stronger military. (Page A1, Columns 4-5.) The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Kenichi Fukui of Japan, whose work was neglected for decades, and to Roald Hoffmann of Cornell University, who developed a similar theory independently. Their work involves what is considered a major advance in applying the theories of quantum mechanics to predict the course of chemical reactions.

I lay in the cradle of the computerized axial tomographer - the CAT scanner -with foam-rubber padding across my chest and a liquid sensitive to radiation dripping into a vein in my arm. In the control room, a technician pushed a button, and the cradle inched into a large metal tube. Like a salami in a delicatessen meat slicer, I passed slowly through the scanner. Five months earlier, I had lain in this cradle shortly after a malignant tumor had been discovered in my left lung. I did not know then if I could be treated.
