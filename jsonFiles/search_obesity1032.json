While the parents look on, a drop of blood is fed into a machine, and a nurse reads impassively from the printout: ''Neurological condition probability, 60 percent. Manic-depression probability, 42 percent. Attention-deficit disorder probability, 89 percent.'' Then, after a pause and a sideways glance at the father: ''Heart disorder probability, 99 percent. Early fatal potential. Life expectancy, 30.2 years.'' Dad is devastated. Only 30 years? On second thought, maybe he'll make the next boy his namesake. Like most scenes in ''Gattaca,'' the science-fiction film that opened on Friday, starring Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman, this one evokes the perils of genetic testing. In another sense, however, it could be an allegory for the risky birth of the film itself. A comedy or action film is born every hour, but a drama focused on a serious scientific issue is a rare breed, one fraught with congenital handicaps. Prone to hype, inaccuracy and bloodlessness (call it a high heart-disorder probability), such issue-oriented films tend to sell their subjects short (see ''Outbreak'') or sag under their own good intentions (see ''Contact''). They are, in the futuristic lingo of ''Gattaca,'' ''faith babies.''", "snippet": "THE JOYS OF CHILDBIRTH, 21st-century style: a wailing baby is carried to a counter top and unceremoniously pricked.
