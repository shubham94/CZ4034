The Chicken McNugget, a lab experiment of an entree, larded with ingredients like TBHQ, a flavorless ''stabilizer,'' and Dimethylpolysiloxane, an ''anti-foaming agent,'' is Exhibit A in a lawsuit that could transform the fast-food industry. And it is the McNugget's artificiality -- the judge labeled it a ''McFrankenstein creation'' -- that is putting McDonald's on the legal defensive.", "snippet": "When McDonald's first rolled out the Chicken McNugget in the 1980's, comedians could always get a laugh by asking, with a leer, just what part of the chicken the McNugget was supposed to be.
