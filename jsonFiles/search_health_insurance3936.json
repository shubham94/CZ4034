The panel, convened by the National Institutes of Health, concluded that mammograms might indeed save a very small percentage of women from death.

With all such calculations of probabilities open to challenge, the panel shied away from a blanket recommendation that all women in their 40's have mammograms, as is universally advised for women 50 and older. Instead, the panel concluded that women in their 40's should make that determination individually, in consultation with their doctors.
