Broadway * ''ANNIE GET YOUR GUN.'' Making her Broadway debut, Reba McEntire glides into the title role of Irving Berlin's classic musical like a seabird landing on water. Like Annie Oakley, this chart-topping country singer is a nonchalant showoff, making a highly polished performance look easy. Ms. McEntire has also put a highly personal, proprietary stamp on a role dominated by the ghost of Ethel Merman, using her no-nonsense twang and balladeer's throb to make familiar songs sound fresh as this morning, suggesting Berlin by way of Nashville instead of Tin Pan Alley. And she does what even Bernadette Peters, who won a Tony in this revival, could not. She doesn't just overcome the surroundings of Graciela Daniele's garish, condescending, production; she transforms them, turning the show's smirk into a smile. Be warned, though: the minutes are long when Annie isn't onstage. Brent Barrett is ideal as the man of Annie's dreams (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, near 45th Street, (212) 307-4100.
