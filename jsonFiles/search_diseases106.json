(1964 2014) Carlos F. Barbas III, the Janet and Keith Kellogg II Chair professor and member of The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), died June 24 after a battle with a rare form of medullary thyroid cancer. He was 49. Barbas, who grew up in St. Petersburg, Florida, double-majored in physics and chemistry while graduating with honors at Eckerd College. He earned a PhD in 1989 and conducted postdoctoral studies at Pennsylvania State University and at The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla. He joined the TSRI faculty in 1991, where he conducted studies focused on the development of new therapeutic approaches to human diseases through studies at the interface of synthetic organic chemistry, molecular biology and medicine. Some of his accomplishments include developing the first human antibody phage libraries, creating the first synthetic antibodies, developing the first artificial transcription factors capable of regulating endogenous genes, and pioneering chemically programmed antibodies. Each of these approaches has resulted in a new drug class that is currently in clinical trials or approved for the treatment of a variety of diseases. To translate his research into new therapies, Barbas founded three companies. In 1997, he co-founded Prolifaron, which was acquired by Alexion. In 2002, he started Cov-X, which was acquired by Pfizer. In 2008, he founded Zynegenia to develop the next generation of antibody-derived drugs. Barbas received national and international recognition for his work. He was the recipient of the Investigator Award from the Cancer Research Institute, the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award, Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Pioneer Award and the Tetrahedron Young Investigator Award in Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry. He was named a scholar of The American Foundation for AIDS Research and a fellow of the American Associate for the Advancement of Science. In 2014, Barbas was named a fellow of the Academy of Microbiology. He was author on more than 330 scientific articles and was a named inventor on 58 issued U.S. patents. In a 2009 profile <<a href=\"http://www.eckerd.edu/news/\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.eckerd.edu/news/</a> index.php?f=detail&id=2956> for his alma mater, Eckerd College, Barbas reflected on his decision to become a researcher: \"It's better than I envisioned. I didn't realize when I was studying science all the other opportunities it gives you to see the world. I have a very interesting kind of job that includes traveling the world to give talks. Things that I've worked on are being tested on people, and at some point, there will probably be someone in my family or someone I know who benefits directly.\" In another interview [<a href=\"http://www.scripps.edu/newsandviews/e_20080114/covx.html\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.scripps.edu/newsandviews/e_20080114/covx.html</a>], he said, \"It has been a dream of mine to develop drugs that make a difference.\" \"I extend my deepest condolences to Carlos's family,\" said Michael Marletta, president and CEO of TSRI. \"He was a creative scientist who tackled broad-ranging and important biomedical questions to lay the foundation for new therapies. He was admired and loved by his many friends on our campus. We will miss him greatly.\" Carlos loved to tell jokes, to prank his friends, host legendary parties, race fast cars, go to the gym and, most of all, to spend time with his family.
