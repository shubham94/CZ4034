publicized pet food recall that involved tainted Chinese ingredients, China is coming under international pressure to prove that its exported products are safe. The question worrying Chinese officials is how to assure that ''Made in China'' means well made. [Page C1.] WOLFOWITZ RESIGNS -- Paul D. Wolfowitz announced his resignation as president of the World Bank, ending weeks of furor over charges of favoritism that revealed widespread dissatisfaction with his leadership at the bank. [A1.] THE VALUE OF JOHN SNOW -- John W. Snow, former Treasury secretary who is chairman of Cerberus Capital Management, the company buying Chrysler, is one of the latest politicians hired by private equity for the connections and skills that are honed while working in the upper echelons of government. [C1.] VOTE ON TEXAS PENSION REFORM -- Texas lawmakers are on the verge of rejecting a requirement that state and local governments disclose the cost of the health care they have promised to retired employees. The proposal is intended to encourage politicians to deal ahead of time with the huge obligations they have imposed on future taxpayers. [C1.] LIMITED IMPACT OF DEFAULTS -- The Federal Reserve does not foresee a broader economic impact from the growing number of mortgage defaults and home foreclosures, its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke said, and he cautioned against excessive regulation of lenders. [C1.] A gauge of future economic activity forecasts that the nation's economy will slow in coming months, and suggests that higher gas prices are beginning to take their toll.[C4.] STITCHING TOGETHER A COMPANY -- Louis Gallois, Airbus's third chief executive in 12 months, took the job last year after Airbus and its parent, EADS, announced a major delay in producing its new flagship, the A380 superjumbo jet. He has made progress toward setting the company back on track. But healing the multinational rifts that led to the delay is a challenge he concedes he did not fully anticipate. [C3.] WPP BUYS ONLINE ADVERTISING FIRM -- The WPP Group, the advertising holding company, agreed to pay about $649 million to acquire 24/7 Real Media, an advertising network and technology company. [C3.] FINANCIER DENIES HE IS A TARGET -- A Syrian-born financier, Wafic Said, who helped broker a $79 billion arms contract between BAE Systems and Saudi Arabia two decades ago, said that he was not a target of a money-laundering investigation opened this week by the Swiss authorities. [C3.] WORKING BOTH SIDES OF A DEAL -- Citigroup played a leading role on both sides of a recent deal when Whyte & Mackay, the whiskey maker, was bought out by United Spirits. Citigroup was an adviser to the distiller, and a lender to the buyer. [C7.] WAYS TO KEEP VIEWERS -- A broadcast network, CW, will soon offer advertisers two more ways to try holding the attention of viewers throughout those commercial breaks that consumers love to hate. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C5.] OUT OF PRINT? NOT SO FAST -- Simon & Schuster is proposing a change in the way it defines when a book is out of print. The change, which reflects new print-on-demand technologies, would allow more books to stay under contract longer, and the Authors Guild is urging a protest. [C3.] AFTER SPITZER -- Under Eliot Spitzer, lawyers in the New York attorney general's office reined in Wall Street analysts, curbed mutual fund abuses and corralled insurance companies. Now that Mr. Spitzer, left, occupies the governor's office in Albany, the options facing these lawyers have ranged from law firm partnerships to state agency heads. And some have chosen to join big Wall Street law firms. [C6.] MARKETS SLIP -- Stocks edged lower as an upbeat report on business conditions in the mid-Atlantic region, coupled with data suggesting strength in the job market, signaled a reduced chance of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. [C9.] UNION'S HELP FOR YOUNG WORKERS -- The Service Employees International Union has created a nonprofit organization that plans to provide health insurance and financial advice to young workers, while also publicly advocating for issues important to labor. [A18.] SEEKING A NOMINEE'S WITHDRAWAL -- Senate Democrats urged President Bush to withdraw his nomination of a lobbyist from the National Association of Manufacturers to lead the Consumer Product Safety Commission, saying the candidate was unqualified and the appointment posed conflicts of interest.

Headrick, amid concern that his re-election was aided by votes cast without guidance from shareholders.
