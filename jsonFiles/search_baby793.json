My hellebores have hundreds of seedlings popping up at their bases. Obviously, I will pot up some or move them to other parts of the garden. But it is impossible to move each one, and I am afraid of injuring the mother plant by digging too deep and too close. My question is, what harm is done by leaving them? There are so many, so close together, that I am afraid they will crowd each other out and take nutrition away from the mother plant. A. From early spring through the end of May is the best time to move those seedlings. Use a dandelion weeder or a kitchen fork to gently loosen the soil with a jiggling motion, and then lift and tease out the roots of the individual seedlings, letting them come apart at their own speed. Avoid using trowels or other large tools that may disturb the mother plant if you go too close. Transplant the seedlings, which are probably two to three years old, into a shady area where drainage is good. Water them in well, and watch for drought stress over the summer. Don't try transplanting the seedlings if it is hot, because they could become stressed before the roots recover and the plant begins to transpire.", "headline": {"main": "Garden Q.&A.", "kicker": "Garden Q.&A."}, "abstract": "Questions and answers on gardening: controlling prolific seeding by hellebores, leafing problems of sycamores, applying Bacillus thuringiensis against Eastern tent caterpillars; drawing (M)", "print_page": "12", "word_count": 943, "_id": "4fd1f9478eb7c8105d756021", "snippet": "Too Many Seedlings     Q.
