Tashkin advocates medicinal use of dronabinol, a synthetic cannabinoid in capsule form, instead of smoked cannabis. Most patients who have compared smoked cannabis with dronabinol say that smoking is always more effective. Variations in the absorption of oral cannabis from the digestive tract make it difficult to control the dose. Also, people who suffer from nausea and vomiting find it difficult to take cannabis orally. Dr. Tashkin reviews some concerns about the long-term effects of cannabis smoking on the lungs. After studying cannabis more than 25 years, I have come to believe, largely due to Dr. Tashkin's work, that pulmonary effects are the only well-documented harm from long-term cannabis use. I believe his letter exaggerates this, but it has little to do with use of cannabis as a medicine. I would share Dr. Tashkin's concern if medical cannabis users had to smoke many cigarettes a day. But most people who use cannabis as a medicine (for multiple sclerosis, AIDS weight loss syndrome, migraine headaches, epilepsy, menstrual tension, nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy) need a few puffs to relieve symptoms. Patients who use some of the newer, more potent strains of marijuana need to inhale even less noxious smoke. Dr. David B. Busch of the Department of Environmental and Toxicologic Pathology has demonstrated, examining lung cells, that sinsemilla, a potent form, has fewer of the pulmonary effects Dr. Tashkin describes than standard varieties. Water pipes can also filter carcinogen substances in marijuana, a practice the Government unfortunately discourages. When marijuana becomes available as a medicine, we should see even more efficient ways to separate noxious from useful constituents of the smoke. Dr. Tashkin's cautions should be taken seriously in some contexts, but they have little relevance to the use of smoked cannabis as a medicine.
