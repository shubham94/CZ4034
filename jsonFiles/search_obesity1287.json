Access America Inc., a subsidiary of Blue Cross and Blue Shield, sells trip cancellation insurance that will reimburse travelers for the nonrefundable portion of their travel expenses if they are headed to a city where there has been a terrorist attack within 30 days of their scheduled arrival. If a traveler had planned a trip to Madrid next week, for example, but decided not to go after the terrorist bombings this week that killed 9 civil guards and wounded 43 civilians, the traveler could cancel the trip and collect the costs of hotel room deposits, airline tickets and tour fees depending on how much coverage he or she bought. Access America added the terrorism clause in April to its trip interruption or cancellation coverage. The insurance is one of a variety of travel insurance coverage plans that travelers should consider if they are taking summer trips, whether to foreign countries or within the United States.", "snippet": "FOR those intrepid travelers who decided months ago that, terrorism or no terrorism, they were going abroad this summer, a travel insurance company now offers a policy that covers second thoughts.

Well, many of them have legitimate cause to complain. According to a report in the July 4 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, some people gain weight more easily than others - and have more trouble taking it off. Perhaps it is this hard-core weight-troubled group that supports the seemingly endless supply of diet books published each year, more than 100 of which are on the market at any one time, with a best seller among them every week. The current hot diet books are ''Fit for Life,'' by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond, and ''The Rice Diet Report,'' by Judy Moscovitz - in which the road to weight loss is paved with foods eaten in specific combinations - and ''The Rotation Diet'' by Dr. Martin Katahn, a high-carbohydrate approach advocating short periods of severely limited caloric intake.", "snippet": "YOU know all those people who insist that if they so much as glance at a piece of apple pie, they gain weight?
