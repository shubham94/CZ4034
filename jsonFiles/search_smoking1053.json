The quotation from ''La Belle Dame Sans Merci'' set Miss Carson's theme, that the indiscriminate use of pesticides was poisoning the natural world. If this continued, she warned, the environment would become so damaged that the song of birds in springtime would be silenced forever. She also warned of serious risks of cancer and other threats to human health. Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since ''Silent Spring'' was published in 1962. It became one of the most influential books of this century, helping to touch off an environmental revolution and changing the way the nation and much of the world looks at pesticides and pollutants generally.", "snippet": "At the beginning of her landmark book, ''The Silent Spring,'' Rachel Carson quoted these lines from John Keats:   The sedge is wither'd from the lake, And no birds sing.

If members of the American College of Physicians who met here earlier this month felt that way, they were not admitting it. Through lung cancer, heart disease and chronic lung disease, experts say, cigarettes are implicated in 350,000 deaths each year - one out of every six in the United States. But while the percentage of adult American smokers has dropped from 55 to about 30 (and to less than 17 percent of physicians) researchers have found that many of those who are still puffing do not even want to stop. Would higher taxes or stronger warning labels change their minds? What about a ban on cigarette advertising, which the American Medical Association recently endorsed but the tobacco industry contends would be unconstitutional and ineffective? Or rules that restrict lighting up in public places, such as those recently passed in Long Island and proposed by Mayor Koch? What more can doctors do about what many believe is public health enemy No. 1? These were among the questions considered at the College of Physicians meeting by a panel that comprised Dr. C. Everett Koop, the United States Surgeon General; Dr. Elizabeth M. Whelan, executive director of the American Council on Science and Health; Dr. Alan Blum, founder of Doctors Ought to Care, a coalition of community health groups, and Dr. David P. L. Sachs, an expert in smoking cessation research who is on the clinical faculty of the Stanford University School of Medicine.", "snippet": "IN the 1940's, a tobacco company proudly advertised that ''more doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarettes.''
