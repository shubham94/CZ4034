Baden said yesterday that he had submitted his resignation as the chief deputy medical examiner in Suffolk County and would return to the staff of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York City, where Mayor Koch removed him as Acting Chief Medical Examiner four years ago. Dr. Baden has been on a leave of absence from the city during his two years in Suffolk, where he had been considered a leading candidate to become Chief Medical Examiner until last winter. He became embroiled in a dispute with the Suffolk County Executive, who tried briefly to dismiss Dr. Baden. He is returning to New York so he will not lose city Civil Service protection, according to his lawyer, Robert C. Gottlieb. Dr. Baden's resignation in Suffolk will take effect Sept. 9, Mr. Gottlieb said.", "headline": {"main": "BADEN QUITTING SUFFOLK TO RETURN TO CITY POSITION"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 714, "_id": "4fd1468f8eb7c8105d621a76", "snippet": "Dr. Michael M.

One woman's joints are painfully swollen and stiff as if arthritic. Another has problems swallowing and digesting food and has lost a great deal of weight. Despite their great variety of symptoms, all these people have the same disease. It's called scleroderma - from the Greek meaning ''hard skin'' - so named because its primary manifestation is a thickening and hardening of skin and lining tissue anywhere and sometimes everwhere in the body. In the most severe form of scleroderma, the victims may watch themselves in effect turn to stone. Only the central nervous system is predictably spared the disease's ravages.
