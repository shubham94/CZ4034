NATO military leaders were expected to finish planning for a peacekeeping force at a meeting in Belgium today. A1 NATO continued air strikes across Yugoslavia, despite signs that President Slobodan Milosevic might be prepared to negotiate. NATO jets carried out strikes against Yugoslav units that NATO said were trying to repel an offensive by the Kosovo Liberation Army along Kosovo's southwestern border. A12 NATO air attacks killed at least 16 civilians and wounded 43 when four missiles hit a hospital complex in the town Surdulica. The intensifying air campaign is tied to efforts to get President Milosevic to agree to NATO demands. A12 Kosovo Update A13 Tiananmen Inquiry Sought More than a hundred relatives of people killed when the Chinese army smashed pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989 have petitioned the Government to open a criminal investigation of the officials responsible. This is the first time that the victims' relatives have tried to use China's nascent legal system for redress. A1 China Assails Espionage Report China issued its broadest attack yet on the Congressional report that says China stole nuclear and missile technologies, calling the document a tissue of half-truths, conjecture and lies. China's Information Minister said detailed information on American nuclear weapons was readily available from public sites on the Internet. A6 India Agrees to Peace Talks Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee agreed to hold talks with Pakistan about the ''warlike situation'' in Kashmir, even as India continued bombing what it called a Pakistani-sponsored band of 700 guerrillas occupying Indian territory. A6 Kurdish Leader Apologizes The rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, on the first day of his trial in Turkey on treason charges, apologized for his past and said he would call for an end to guerrilla violence if Turkish authorities would give him the chance to turn his army into a civilian political party. Mr. Ocalan admitted that he and his fighters were responsible for all the killings and other acts attributed to them. A3 New Appointees in Russia President Boris N. Yeltsin put Viktor Khristenko, left, and Mikhail Zadornov, two familiar and reform-minded fiscal experts, in top economic posts. Both appointments seemed to have been sought by Mr. Yeltsin's latest Prime Minister, Sergei Stepashin, who has been battling rival political forces to place loyalists in senior Government posts. A14 World Briefing A10 NATIONAL A16-21 U.S. Is Investigating A New Medicare Practice The Government is examining the growing use of part-time rehabilitation clinics in doctors' offices. The doctors rent office space a few days a week to therapists, who are paid by Medicare to treat patients referred by the doctors. Critics say the practice runs the risk of violating fraud, abuse and kickback laws. But one company that runs such clinics, Senior Health Care, said its arrangements were legal because it paid ''fair market value'' for the space it rented and that doctors were not required to refer patients. A16 New Type of Cosmic Objects New surveys of the sky are surprising astronomers with mystifying discoveries in recent weeks, including an entirely new cosmic category of numerous dim, reddish objects that scientists are calling methane brown dwarfs. The discoveries were announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. A19 Fixing Up the Space Station Astronauts from the shuttle Discovery repaired a radio, replaced flawed battery packs and installed foam mufflers over noisy fans on the international space station. A16 Government Net Sites Attacked Computer hackers vandalized two Government sites on the Internet and left a note threatening to attack more because of an F.B.I. investigation. Last week, hackers disrupted the F.B.I. and Senate sites. The attacks were apparently in retaliation for what the hackers say is F.B.I. harassment of hacker groups. A20 Egyptian Collection Reopens The Egyptian gallery of the Oriental Institute in Chicago, featuring a colossal statue of Tutankhamen, opened last weekend for the first time since 1996. The institute's galleries were closed to the public for a $10.1 million renovation primarily to safeguard artifacts from climate damage. The other galleries are to reopen during the next three years. A20 Instilling Values in School The nation's public schools, which taught the Bible for generations until the 1960's, are under growing pressure to offer ethics instruction as a way to promote safe learning free of harassment. Educators say the recent school shootings and last week's Supreme Court ruling on sexual harassment by students have given the issue new urgency. School administrators are worried about legal protections, but advocates of public moral education say that though the Supreme Court banned prayer in schools it has never insisted that schools be neutral on values. A17 Memorial for a Lynching About 60 people gathered in a white church in Georgia for a Memorial Day service recalling the killings of a black World War II veteran and three relatives in 1946. A Federal grand jury investigation at the time produced no indictments. The case was reopened in 1991, when a witness came forward, but there have been no arrests. A18 NEW YORK/REGION B1-10 Lincoln Center May Mount Big Campaign for Overhaul Officials at Lincoln Center are weighing the possibility of a vast fund-raising campaign to help the performing arts complex, which is approaching its 40th birthday, reverse the effects of decades of wear and tear and address other gnawing problems. A1 Burial of Train Victims A mother who immigrated from Ecuador and four young sons were buried in Connecticut. They were killed by a train as they walked on the tracks early Tuesday. B4 Girl, 3, Shot to Death A 3-year-old girl died after being hit in a drive-by shooting as she stood with her father on a Bronx street corner, the police said. B3 Brooklyn Home for Farm Team The city is looking at one of its most famous sandlots -- the playing fields at Prospect Park's Parade Grounds -- as a site for a New York Mets farm team until a permanent stadium is built in Coney Island. B3 SCIENCE TIMES F1-14 A Key to Good Health Research is showing that social class -- as measured by income, education and other markers of relative status -- is a powerful predictor of health, more powerful than genetics, exposure to carcinogens, even smoking. In other words, the higher the rung on the socioeconomic ladder, the lower the risk to health. F1 Stress and Longevity The ability to handle stress well seems to be a common trait among people in study of centenarians. F7 Drug Combination for the Heart Adding a ''super aspirin'' to a standard clot-dissolving drug is a more effective treatment for heart attacks than either drug alone, according to a study being published today. F2 Health & Fitness F7 ARTS E1-10 SPORTS D1-8 Spurs Shock Trail Blazers San Antonio came back from 17 points down to beat Portland, 86-85, and take a 2-0 lead in the Western Conference Finals. D3 OBITUARIES C13 William E. Ringel A Manhattan judge who ruled Andy Warhol's ''Blue Movie'' obscene, lectured civil rights protesters on the evils of anarchy and sent a parade of slumlords, thieves and vagrants to jail during 25 years on the bench, he was 97. C13 William R. Lawley Jr. A World War II bomber pilot who received the Medal of Honor for a mission over Europe, he was 78. C13 BUSINESS DAY C1-12 Opposition to Book Merger The F.T.C. staff has recommended that the commission block the planned $600 million acquisition by Barnes & Noble, the nation's largest bookseller, of Ingram Book Group, its largest book wholesaler, a person involved in the deal said. A1 Conrail Changeover Norfolk Southern and CSX, which dominate commercial rail traffic in much of the East, take over chunks of Conrail today, the most sweeping change in a generation in the Northeast's commercial railroads -- especially in the New York area. C1 Korean Bank Sales Delayed The Financial Supervisory Commission, the financial watchdog charged with cleaning up South Korea's debt-laden financial institutions, said it had extended negotiations over the final terms of the sale of Seoul Bank to HSBC Holdings until June 30. The commission also delayed for a third time the sale of Korea First Bank to a group of investors led by two American financiers. C1 Microsoft Executive on Leave Microsoft said Nathan Myhrvold, its chief technology officer, would take a yearlong sabbatical to pursue scientific research and travel. C2 Stocks Gain Around World European stocks ended slightly higher in thin volume, as holidays in the United States and Britain left trading quiet. In Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney, stocks rose.
