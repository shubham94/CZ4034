As outside air is kept out, household pollutants are sealed in. Cigarette smoke, paint odors, insecticide sprays, animal hairs, airborne asbestos fibers, mildew, oven fumes, even air-fresheners collect in the air. Tests have linked them to everything from coughs to an increased risk of cancer. Though researchers have been investigating outdoor pollution for decades and pollution in offices and public buildings for at least 10 years, only recently has air pollution in homes commanded significant attention. Experts estimate that people spend as much as 90 percent of their time indoors, much of it in their homes, and they are beginning to look at home pollution more closely. The Consumer Federation of America, a consumer-advocacy group, has called the problem its ''No. 1 health and safety issue of the year.'' The American Lung Association has begun a national education program to alert people to it. A Federal interagency task force has been established so that groups such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Energy and the Department of Health and Human Services can pool information and resources.", "snippet": "ALL the caulking, weatherstripping and insulating of the energy-conscious 70's has had an unintended and unhealthy effect: air pollution in homes.
