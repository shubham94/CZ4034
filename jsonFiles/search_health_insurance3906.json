Thomas Golisano ECONOMY AND TAXES -- Centerpiece of his campaign is an attack on Mr. Pataki for raising state debt, and says he would reduce it. Criticizes Mr. Pataki's use of financial incentives to business, saying they should be linked to guarantees of job retention over a specific period of years. Advocates elimination of Thruway tolls. Says state spending should be reduced, but does not say how. EDUCATION -- Supports charter schools. Says schools should be made to meet performance standards and reduce administrative costs. Advocates a freeze on public college tuition, and says the colleges should focus more on computer technology. Says schools should expand occupational training for students who are not academically oriented and are likely to drop out. CRIME -- Says the state should spend much more money on drug education and treatment, as an alternative to prison for nonviolent drug offenders. Supports the death penalty. Does not support stronger gun-control laws. Criticizes the current justice system as putting too many people in prison, but does not say what the alternative is. CAMPAIGN FINANCE -- Advocates term limits as the best way to limit the financial advantage of incumbents. But does not support restrictions on contributions, soft money or transfers from one committee to another. HEALTH CARE -- Says he will conduct a thorough investigation of Medicaid to find areas where spending could be cut. Opposes forcing health insurers to cover contraceptives. Advocates expansion of medical savings accounts for people to help cover health care costs. George E. Pataki ECONOMY AND TAXES -- Has consistently worked to lower taxes, most importantly those on income, property and business profits. Says he will continue to cut taxes in a second term, but does not give specifics. Aggressively promotes the use of financial incentives like tax breaks, loans, low-cost electric power to retain employers in New York State and to attract new ones. EDUCATION -- Signed into law state program to make kindergarten and prekindergarten classes available in every community, and to lower elementary class sizes by 2002. Strong advocate of charter schools, specialized schools that operate outside the usual bureaucratic restraints, which are opposed by teacher unions. Has agreed to major increases in education spending, but vetoed money to increase teachers' salaries and speed up school construction. Cut subsidies for public colleges and imposed a $750-a-year tuition increase, but also won a $3 billion capital improvement program for the campuses. CRIME -- Won re-enactment of the death penalty, tougher penalties for violent crimes and sharp limitations on parole. Advocates tougher sentences for juvenile offenders. Enacted state's first program of sending drug offenders to treatment rather than prison, but it is small in scope. Has said he favors easing state's strict drug-possession penalties. Supports continued prison construction. CAMPAIGN FINANCE -- Has said he dislikes the current system, but has not said how he would change it. Disapproves of advocacy groups independent of campaigns advertising for or against a candidate, and of wealthy people running for office with their own money, but says he does not think either one can be restrained legally. Has not taken a position on whether the state's high contribution limits should be lower, or whether soft money and transfers from one political committee to another should be limited. Opposes public financing. HEALTH CARE -- Has cut back Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, but has expanded health care programs for poor children. Has not said what he would do to help the three million New Yorkers without medical coverage. Betsy McCaughey Ross ECONOMY AND TAXES -- Favors mandating lower utility rates, greater tax credits for investment in research, and large-scale government investment in training adults for high-tech jobs. EDUCATION -- Was one of the prime forces behind the universal kindergarten and prekindergarten program signed by Mr. Pataki, now being carried out. Proposes an aggressive reading program for children in the early grades, and earlier testing to catch those children who cannot read. CRIME -- Supports capital punishment. Advocates laws requiring trigger locks on handguns, and laws holding adults legally responsible when their children cause injury or death with a gun. Supports greater use of drug treatment as an alternative to incarceration. CAMPAIGN FINANCE -- Favors banning soft money, and limiting contributions by special interests, particularly health insurers. HEALTH CARE -- Advocates giving patients the right to appeal to an independent panel of experts when their insurers deny coverage for a treatment, and says a law enacted this year to do that does not go far enough. Supports similar appeals system to obtain coverage for experimental treatment of people who are gravely ill. Says law should be changed to allow patients to sue health insurers for denial of coverage. Peter F. Vallone ECONOMY AND TAXES -- Voted several times in the 1980's for higher taxes, and was a prime force behind a 1991 city income tax increase to expand the Police Department. But has worked frequently since then to lower taxes, and led the way this year in rescinding the 1991 increase. Says the state will have trouble paying for Mr. Pataki's property tax cuts, but would not repeal them. Says surpluses should be used to pay off state debts. Calls the Governor's tax breaks to companies ''corporate welfare.'' Major economic development idea is to have the state give preference to New York companies in awarding contracts. EDUCATION -- Says public college tuition should be cut in half for students who maintain a B average. Advocates state-financed, educational after-school program at every school, but is vague about how to pay for it. Supports effort to make kindergarten and prekindergarten available in every community, and to lower elementary-school class sizes. Says the state budget surplus should have been used to speed up those efforts, rather than to pay for tax cuts. Says he does not oppose charter schools, but would want guarantees that other schools would not get less money and that teachers' job security would not be threatened. CRIME -- Supports the death penalty, and has backed tougher penalties for serious crimes. Says low-level drug offenders should be allowed to enter treatment instead of prison. Questions need for new prisons. Sponsored 1991 law that increased city income tax to pay for Police Department's expansion. CAMPAIGN FINANCE -- Has proposed for the state a system like the one he initiated in the city, which includes spending limits and mandatory debates for candidates who accept it. Supports much lower limits on individual contributions to state races, tight restrictions on soft money and transfers from one political committee to another. HEALTH CARE -- Advocates government-subsidized health care for all, saying it is the only way to insure the three million New Yorkers without any coverage, but is unclear on how to pay for it. Says the state should relieve local governments of their Medicaid costs, but again does not say how to pay for it.", "headline": {"main": "Where the Candidates Stand", "kicker": "THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE ISSUES"}, "abstract": "Outline of where New York gubernatorial candidates stand on issues of economy and taxes, education, crime, campaign finance and health care; photo (M)", "print_page": "5", "word_count": 1153, "_id": "4fd1e16f8eb7c8105d72a02b", "snippet": "B.
