Injections give a big burst of insulin rather than adjusting the levels based on how much sugar there is in the blood. Pumps have been developed that can be implanted in the body and dispense insulin gradually, but this still does not match the level of insulin to the need. Now researchers in numerous corporate and university laboratories are working on the crucial missing link: a tiny sensor that could sit in a blood vessel and monitor the levels of glucose in the blood. This information could then be relayed to an electronically controlled insulin pump, thus forming, in effect, a self-regulating artificial pancreas.", "headline": {"main": "Technology; The New Field Of Biosensors"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 792, "_id": "4fd15f1d8eb7c8105d647c8c", "snippet": "INSULIN injections are not the ideal solution for diabetics.
