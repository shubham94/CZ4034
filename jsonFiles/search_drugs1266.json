But while a temporary sleep disturbance is of little significance to health, dry mouth, another side effect of this and other medications that is commonly overlooked, can be more serious, especially if a drug is taken for a chronic ailment. Doctors often caution patients that a prescribed drug may cause gastrointestinal distress, emotional disturbances or potency problems. And many people now realize that certain drugs can induce sleep and should not be used when operating a vehicle or dangerous equipment. But few are warned about the effects both prescription and over-the-counter drugs can have on important organs like their mouths, eyes, ears and skin. Oral Health Since a steady flow of cleansing saliva is vital to the health of teeth and gums, persistent dry mouth can result in serious tooth decay, periodontal disease and, ultimately, loss of teeth. Travelers who use a scopolamine patch behind the ear to prevent motion sickness are usually all too aware of the oral dryness this drug causes. But for many other medications, the effects on saliva are more subtle and often overlooked or dismissed as a minor problem. Among the many drugs taken indefinitely that can slow salivary flow are diuretics like Lasix, Hydrodiuril and Dyrenium used to treat high blood pressure, other antihypertensive medications like Aldomet, Catapres and Minipress, anti-anxiety agents like Librium, Miltown and Valium, antidepressants like Elavil and Tofranil, antipsychotics like compazine, Haldol, Mellaril and thorazine and drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease like Artane and Larodopa. Dry mouth can also be caused by medications used for short-term relief, like antihistamines, which are often taken by people with upper respiratory infections as well as allergies. Among the most popular drugs in this category are Actifed (a combination of pseudoephedrine and antihistamine, both of which stem salivary flow), Benadryl, Chlor-Trimeton, Dimetane and Phenergan. Other drugs taken indefinitely can cause gums to enlarge, become tender or bleed. They include aspirin, its derivatives and estrogen. Vision Problems Dr. Jimmy Bartlett, an optometrist affiliated with the University of Alabama, has reported, \"It is not at all unusual for a patient to come into our clinic with a vision complaint, only to find out the real problem is a particular medication he or she is taking.\" He explained that most people do not realize that common medications, like steroids and diuretics, can cause eye problems. For example, the same medications that cause dry mouth can also dry up tear flow in the eyes, causing severe irritation for wearers of contact lenses. Dr. Bartlett listed these drugs as among the more commonly used ones that can cause ocular problems: *Corticosteroids, taken for a year or longer, can trigger the start of a cataract, or clouding of the lens that reduces sharpness of vision. The cataract stops developing, but does not disappear, when the drug is stopped. *Digitalis, the heart stimulant, is among several cardiac drugs that can disrupt color vision, sometimes causing patients to see colors that are not there. *Chloroquine (Aralen), used to prevent malaria and to treat connective-tissue diseases like arthritis, can cause sensitivity to and scattering of light as well as pigment changes inside the eye that dim vision. *Sulfa drugs and diuretics may cause nearsightedness and blurred vision. *Antipsychotics can produce a gritty, stinging and burning feeling in the eyes. *Oral contraceptives may in some women cause bleeding in the eye or clotting disorders that block blood flow to parts of the eye. Dr. Bartlett said that in most such cases the problem can be corrected by cutting doses or switching drugs. Hearing Problems Many drugs have toxic effects on the ear's delicate tissues. For example, continued aspirin use, like the doses commonly prescribed to treat arthritis, can cause ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and deafness. Tinnitus may also occur during treatment with chloroquine, a drug that can result in nerve damage several weeks after high-dose therapy ends. Some antibiotics can harm the ears. Auditory damage can be especially severe from kanamycin and neomycin. Gentamicin and tobramycin can damage the vestibular canals, causing dizziness and loss of balance. Skin Problems From 1 to 3 percent of patients experience skin reactions caused by medications. Problems range from rashes to oversensitivity to sunlight. For example, severe sun damage (sunburn, swelling, blisters, excessive pigmentation, rashes) can be set off by many antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs, the antihistamine Benadryl, antibiotics like tetracycline, doxycycline and the sulfa drugs, chloroquine used on a long-term basis, diuretics like the thiazides and Lasix, antidiabetic drugs, oral contraceptives, benzocaine and even some sunscreens. Allergic reactions, like skin rashes, are also common and often misleading because sensitivity to a drug may develop over time or may not show up until after the patient has stopped taking it. Skin rashes or hives have been associated with antiobiotics like penicillin, streptomycin, ampicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin and neomycin, and with allopurinol, barbiturates, codeine and some diuretics. What to Do Whenever a drug is prescribed, ask the doctor for a list of common side effects, both serious and pesky. Ask under what circumstances you should report a possible side effect as soon as it is noticed. Dr. Bartlett, the optometrist, also suggests that people on long-term medication (either prescribed or over-the-counter) should have frequent eye examinations. If you are taking a drug sold over the counter, be sure to check accompanying literature or labels for warnings about side effects. If you experience an unusual reaction while taking any medication, it is best to check with your doctor without delay, but do not discontinue a prescribed medication or adjust the dosage without first seeking medical advice.", "headline": {"main": "Personal Health"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "13", "word_count": 962, "_id": "4fd19dc18eb7c8105d6b0699", "snippet": "A TRAVELING companion who was having trouble sleeping was surprised and relieved to learn that Sudafed (pseudoephedrine), the decongestant she was taking to suppress symptoms of a cold, was a stimulant that often induced wakefulness.
