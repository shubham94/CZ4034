The daily visits have replaced the twice-weekly appointments with a private physician who saw her when her mother could still afford the health insurance offered by her employer. The clinic grew out of a deliberate attempt to counteract recent trends in health-care consolidation, an effort to make sure that insurance-poor inner cities don't suffer at the expense of the suburbs. It's one of more than 40 programs being financed by a foundation set up during creation of the eight-hospital St. Barnabas Health Care System two years ago, an agreement that resulted in the merger of two institutions with roots in Newark, Newark Beth Israel Hospital and St. Barnabas Hospital.", "snippet": "For the past month Khaliqa Bell, a 10-year-old fifth grader at George Washington Carver School here, has been a regular at a new clinic at the school, where she is treated  for her eczema.
