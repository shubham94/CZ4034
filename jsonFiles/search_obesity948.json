This intriguing phenomenon is called the French Paradox, and it has drawn comment, criticism and speculation for much of this decade. But the latest treatise on the subject, published in a recent issue of The British Medical Journal, suggests the paradox may not be so paradoxical after all. Rather, the authors maintain, it is only a matter of time before the fatty French diet exacts its coronary toll. These scientists, Malcolm Law and Nicholas Wald, specialists in preventive medicine at St. Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, point out that for decades until 1970, the French ate much less animal fat and had significantly lower blood cholesterol levels than did Britons, who were in no better shape than Americans.", "snippet": "Americans, famous for wanting their cake and eating it too, were delighted to learn that even though French foods seem to be rich in fat, much of it artery-clogging saturated animal fat, the French are not nearly as likely to be cut down in midlife...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "PERSONAL HEALTH (TIMES COLUMN)", "name": "creative_works"}, {"value": "WALD, NICHOLAS", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "LAW, MALCOLM", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "FRANCE", "name": "glocations"}, {"value": "HEART", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "DIET AND NUTRITION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "WINES", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "FIBERS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "ALCOHOL", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "CHOLESTEROL", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "NUTS", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "1", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 1499, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}, {"news_desk": "Health & Fitness", "document_type": "article", "_id": "4fd1ea2b8eb7c8105d739757", "headline": {"kicker": "VITAL SIGNS: TRENDS", "main": "As Obesity Rises, Drownings Decline"}, "pub_date": "1999-06-22T00:00:00Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "source": "Reuters", "byline": null, "abstract": "Researchers report that fewer people are drowning in United States, and two reasons may be a decline in alcohol use and a rise in sedentary behavior among young people (S)", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/22/health/vital-signs-trends-as-obesity-rises-drownings-decline.html", "section_name": "Health", "lead_paragraph": "Fewer people are drowning in the United States, and two reasons may be a decline in alcohol use and a rise in sedentary behavior among young people, researchers have reported.
