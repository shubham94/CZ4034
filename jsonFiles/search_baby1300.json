By John Kelly For most of his life William Ristow suffered from severe asthma. As a boy, he was near death twice, and later as a teen-ager he was bedridden and exhausted for months at a time. Even during the good periods when his breathing grew strong and rhythmic, his illness kept him from the swimming, running, dancing and other activities that young men of his age take for granted. Then, in 1975, at the age of 24, Mr. Ristow was introduced to a drug called albuterol. ''I'd been taking 90 inhalations a day of my old medication, which was 10 times the recommended dosage,'' he says, ''and that was just barely keeping me ambulatory. I not only needed a lot less albuterol - my daily intake fell to 15 inhalations - but it produced an almost magical change in my quality of life. It was as if I had woken up one morning and my asthma suddenly had been cured.''", "headline": {"main": "by John Kelly", "kicker": "BRIDGING AMERICA'S DRUG GAP"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "100", "word_count": 4007, "_id": "4fd1181b8eb7c8105d5d03b1", "snippet": "DRUG PART 1 John Kelly is co-author of ''The Secret Life of the Unborn Child.''
