Our research demonstrates that those who make large contributions to Congressional candidates (and whose economic and legislative interests line up neatly with PAC inter- ests) provide more money to these candidates than PAC's do. In 1992, large individual contributions made up 35 percent of the total given to Congressional candidates, compared with 29 percent from PAC's. When you include Presidential candidates, large individual contributions ($375 million) dwarf PAC contributions ($180 million) more than two to one. When you add large contributions from business-connected individuals to PAC contributions from the same businesses, the grand total dwarfs the next largest source of money -- labor -- by six to one. (If you compare PAC totals only, the ratio is three to one.) PAC and large individual contributions together maximize the political clout of business. Our research shows this is true for every category of business, particularly health care, insurance and finance. Furthermore, the profiles of members of Congress who eschew PAC contributions, taking only contributions from individuals, show economically interested funding patterns virtually identical to those who accept PAC contributions. Framing the campaign finance reform issue as a PAC issue encourages narrowly drawn \"reforms,\" which are more likely to freeze into place the worst aspects of the system or even make it worse. If we want real reform, which addresses the conflicts of interest and disenfranchising inequalities inherent in private financing of public elections, we need to understand the source of that financing. And that source is not just PAC's. ELLEN S.
