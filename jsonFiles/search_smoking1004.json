Like the characters who ramble amiably through this sprawling, funny, emotionally raw 1978 film -which has a style that's of a piece with the director's other long films of the 1970's, among them ''Minnie and Moskowitz'' (1971), ''A Woman Under the Influence'' (1974) and ''The Killing of a Chinese Bookie'' (1976) - Mr. Cassavetes displays a remarkably free-spirited point of view. ''Opening Night,'' previously unreleased in the United States, is a reminder of what has made Mr. Cassavetes' films so appealing, and of what can make them so maddening, too.
