They contend that 7-Up's advertising campaign is based on unsubstantiated health concerns. The dangers of caffeine, they argue, have never been proved. This is the the latest in a series of controversies involving caffeine during the last few years that have changed the public perception of America's favorite wake-up beverage from a friendly, harmless substance to a potentially dangerous drug.

The declining consumption of regular coffee, the steep rise in the proportion of decaffeinated coffees, the explosive growth of herbal teas and the recent introduction of ordinary teas stripped of caffeine are all testimony to millions of good intentions. Yet many people find that they are unable to wean themselves completely from coffee and other sources of caffeine and its chemical relatives. Plagued by a host of withdrawal symptoms that are quickly relieved by a dose of caffeine, they are soon back to their old habits.
