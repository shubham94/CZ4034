If a nonprofit organization is the beneficiary of an individual retirement account or a Keogh account, must the organization pay taxes on the proceeds? C. RICHARD BECKER, Manhattan A. When a tax-exempt organization is the beneficiary of an I.R.A., the distribution is taxable in the same manner as if it had been made to the deceased owner. But when a tax-exempt organization receives a Keogh account, some portions may not be taxable, depending on several factors, including the participant's nondeductible contributions. \"A nonprofit beneficiary of a Keogh account may be able to use special tax treatments for lump-sum distributions, such as five-year or 10-year averaging and capital gain treatment,\" said Ronald L. Noll, head of a Malvern, Pa., accounting firm bearing his name. \"And if the distribution is due to the employee's death, the nonprofit organization may be able to treat the payment as a lump-sum distribution, whether or not he or she had five years of participation in the plan.\" Medigap Abroad Q. What are the economics of a medigap policy when retiring to a foreign country? Anna-Liisa Rintala, Manhattan A. The purpose of a medigap policy, private insurance that supplements Medicare, is to pay costs not covered by the Federal Medicare program. Medicare generally does not cover health services outside the United States, the primary exception being when a hospital in Canada or Mexico is more accessible than an American hospital. \"Most medigap plans provide some coverage for people who are out of the country on a temporary basis,\" said Rebecca Moore of the American Association of Retired Persons. \"Medigap plans do not offer coverage for people who are living out of the country permanently.\" I.R.A. Into Fixed Annuity Q. Can I transfer an individual retirement account to a fixed annuity so I will not be required to pay taxes until the money is withdrawn? DORIS BROWN, Manhattan A. Yes, you can. One of the categories of tax-deferred accounts established by the law creating individual retirement accounts is an individual retirement annuity. But many financial advisers say you should not switch your I.R.A. into an annuity, because it represents an unnecessary duplication of the tax deferral. Money invested in an I.R.A. grows on a tax-deferred basis, as does money invested in an annuity, explained Avery E. Neumark, a partner of Weber Lipshie & Company, a New York accounting firm. Other types of investments probably make more sense. \"If you wish to roll your account over,\" Mr. Neumark said, \"you must do so within 60 days of the distribution from the original plan. And only one such rollover may be made in any one-year period.\"", "headline": {"main": "Q & A"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "37", "word_count": 499, "_id": "4fd1be2b8eb7c8105d6eb9c1", "snippet": "Nonprofit Beneficiary  Q.
