Drugs are now a legitimate preoccupation of Congress and the White House; the networks, therefore, are preoccupied, too. And yes, there is a chicken-and-egg question about television and the national agenda, although the question does not apply to all issues. Men and women who run for office, especially in an election year, may promote issues because the promotion looks good on television. At the same time, television may promote some issues itself. When it does, however, fervor and interest on the part of office-holders rise. If television is worried about an issue, political constituents must be worried. Politicians react to television; television reacts to politicians. It is one way the agenda is shaped, and it is not an entirely bad way to shape it.", "headline": {"main": "WHEN TV LOOKS AT THE SHADOWY WORLD OF DRUG ABUSE", "kicker": "TV VIEW"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "17", "word_count": 1024, "_id": "4fd165558eb7c8105d6520c3", "snippet": "Television, as has been remarked, does not necessarily tell us what to think, although it does tell us what to think about.
