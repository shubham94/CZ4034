Dr. Miller is a professor of biology at Brown University, a co-author of widely used high school and college biology texts, an ardent advocate of the teaching of evolution -- and a person of faith. In another of his books, ''Finding Darwin's God,'' he not only outlines the scientific failings of creationism and its doctrinal cousin, ''intelligent design,'' but also tells how he reconciles his faith in God with his faith in science.", "headline": {"main": "Opting Out In the Debate On Evolution"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1391, "_id": "4fd24ac88eb7c8105d7e960c", "snippet": "Mainstream scientists, even those who have long urged researchers to speak with a louder voice, stayed away from recent hearings at the Kansas State Board of Education.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/21/science/21evo.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "imagepages/2005/06/21/science/21evo.1.html", "rank": "1", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupWidth1": "250", "MultimediaUrl1": "imagepages/2005/06/21/science/21evo.1.html", "MultimediaPopupHeight1": "325", "MultimediaType1": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EVOLUTION"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Cornelia", "rank": 1, "lastname": "DEAN"}], "original": "By CORNELIA DEAN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-06-21T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Education; Health"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Health & Fitness", "lead_paragraph": "Even though voters often cite competence as a political candidate's most desirable quality, their decisions about which candidates are competent and which are not can rest on as little as a quick glance at a photograph, researchers are reporting.
