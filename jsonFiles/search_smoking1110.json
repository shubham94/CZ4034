That view is shared by public health officials and environmentalists, industry spokesmen, students of public policy and Federal regulatory officials interviewed in recent weeks. These people said efforts to define, identify and reduce risks to the public were being hampered by a dearth of scientific data, a lack of resources and the intrusion of political and ideological considerations into the legislative and regulatory processes. How Safe Is Safe? Above all, they said the Federal effort to protect the public from environmental risks had been bogged down by the inability of regulators to answer a central question: How safe is safe? The question of how much money should be spent to protect the public from environmental hazards is as much a philosophical problem as it is an issue of governance, because it entails setting values on human life and health.", "snippet": "Federal efforts to protect the public from dangerous chemicals and other environmental risks are foundering in a confusing, contradictory, haphazardly administered mire of laws, rules and procedures, according to both proponents and opponents of..."}, {"word_count": 1626, "slideshow_credits": null, "multimedia": [], "news_desk": "Financial Desk", "pub_date": "1985-11-24T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/business/the-psychological-route-to-cutting-costs.html", "blog": [], "_id": "4fd15e678eb7c8105d646638", "headline": {"main": "THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ROUTE TO CUTTING COSTS"}, "subsection_name": null, "abstract": null, "section_name": "Health; Business", "byline": {"original": "By JEFFREY MERVIS; Jeffrey Mervis is the editor of APA Monitor, the American Psychological Association's publication", "person": [{"rank": 1, "firstname": "Jeffrey", "lastname": "MERVIS", "role": "reported", "organization": ""}]}, "print_page": "12", "document_type": "article", "type_of_material": "News", "keywords": [{"value": "LABOR", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "MENTAL HEALTH AND DISORDERS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH", "name": "subject"}], "lead_paragraph": "Bill Thompson was in bad shape.
