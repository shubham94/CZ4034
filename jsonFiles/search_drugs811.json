In a kind of a pharmaceutical version of playing catch with Dad, my father and I shared his hay-fever pills when I was growing up. They were smooth, round yellow tablets, etched with a tiny red corporate symbol that was as delicate as a Chinese ideograph. At a time before people routinely gobbled down a half dozen medicines a day, those pills held a kind of mythic power for me, not only because they could make the misery of allergies disappear but also because they were prescription drugs -- inherently more powerful, more inaccessible, more special. Those yellow pills were called Chlor-Trimeton, manufactured by the Schering-Plough Corporation, first as a prescription drug and then, after 1976, as an over-the-counter medication.
