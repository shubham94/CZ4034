Moreover, although some other aspects of intelligence do dimish, the decline is relatively inconsequential and has been exaggerated in the past, the experts assert. The new research challenges beliefs long held by scientists and the public and suggests that, among people who remain physically and emotionally healthy, some of the most important forms of intellectual growth can continue well into the 80's. It also suggests that declines in intelligence can be reversed in some instances and that earlier notions about the loss of brain cells as a person ages were in error. This more optimistic view of the mental capacities of the aged emerges from a broad range of current studies, from recent literature in the field and from interviews with gerontologists, psychologists and experts in related health sciences.", "headline": {"main": "THE AGING MIND PROVES CAPABLE OF LIFELONG GROWTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2109, "_id": "4fd140d58eb7c8105d6184ae", "snippet": "RESEARCHERS can now demonstrate that certain crucial areas of human intelligence do not decline in old age among people who are generally healthy.

A major objective, said Dr. Eugene Yuliano, the medical director of the state Medicaid program, is to create a new system of public health care for the poor under which participating family doctors would become, in effect, the ''gatekeepers'' for the Medicaid system.
