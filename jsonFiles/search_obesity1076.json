Many complain that it is hard going, that the pounds that were gone by Tuesday have returned (with an extra) by Sunday. Skeptics may suspect them of sneaking chocolates. The skeptics should hang their heads. According to a study by researchers at Rockefeller University, the body has a mind of its own -- and it is bent on getting back to its pre-diet weight. The Rockefeller group recruited 41 people, all of whom were required to live at the university's clinical center while their diet and activities were carefully controlled and rigidly monitored. Of the total, 18 were obese and the 23 others were of normal weight. Both groups burned calories more slowly than normal after they had lost weight and faster than normal when they had gained it. Always their bodies, by adjusting their metabolisms, were seeking to maintain their \"natural\" weight.", "snippet": "Every year Americans spend $40 billion on books, diets, gadgets, pills and powders that promise to help them lose weight.
