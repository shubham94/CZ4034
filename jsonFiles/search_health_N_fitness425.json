The finding came as a surprise, since in vitro studies showed that tangeretin acted like tamoxifen to inhibit mammary cancer cells. Researchers from the University Hospital in Ghent, Belgium, wanted to see if tangeretin could amplify tamoxifen's therapeutic effect in mice with mammary cancer.

One group of the 80 mice drank water with tamoxifen, one drank water with tangeretin, one drank water with both substances and the fourth group served as a control.
