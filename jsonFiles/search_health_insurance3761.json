Both Republicans and Democrats are offering a split personality to voters, proclaiming a love for fiscal discipline and also for calculated spending increases in defense, education, health programs and financing for research. The latest economic projections suggest that both parties will be able to continue avoiding hard choices. If the year finishes up in robust economic health, federal revenues ought to be plentiful enough for Congress and the White House to save some money and pay for targeted programs at the same time. The election may also prove that voters like having it both ways. With the last completed budget of the Clinton era now in place, it is possible to take stock of just what President Clinton has accomplished in budgetary terms. Since 1992, he has brought the discretionary domestic spending portion of the budget down from about 3.5 percent of the domestic economy to roughly 3.2 percent, about the level that it was in 1969, according to Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution. That figure will no doubt disappoint the liberals and progressives who had hoped that the first Democrat elected since the 1970's would reorder the nation's political priorities.", "headline": {"main": "Federal Budgets, Both Ways"}, "abstract": "Editorial, noting that last completed budget of Clinton era is now in place, assesses what Pres Clinton has accomplished in budgetary terms since 1992", "print_page": "14", "word_count": 595, "_id": "4fd202378eb7c8105d767adc", "snippet": "With tempers still sore from their recent federal budget battles, Congress and the White House are quietly preparing for the next fight.
