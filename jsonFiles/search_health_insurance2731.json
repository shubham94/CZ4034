More sellers are putting their homes on the market, houses are selling less quickly and prices are no longer increasing as rapidly as they were in the spring, according to local data and interviews with brokers. In Manhattan, the average sales price fell almost 13 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter, according to a widely followed report to be released today by Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm, and Prudential Douglas Elliman, a real estate firm. [Page A1.] Home builders have never had it so good. Builders are reporting blistering earnings and their shares are trading at or near record highs. And many builders are beginning to cash in. [C1.] Energy Department Begins Campaign to Reduce Fuel Use The Energy Department announced a campaign to persuade Americans to use less energy, a response to record prices for natural gas and heating oil as cooler weather arrives. The energy secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, said that new supplies were still essential but that they were a long-term solution. To react to the damage from hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Mr. Bodman said, only conservation would offer any immediate help. [A21.] High-Speed Internet at 35,000 Feet, but Not in America Boeing's Connexion unit, which sells high-speed Internet access on the aircraft that Boeing builds, has sold its service to airlines in Europe, Asia and the Middle East but airlines in the United States, citing cost concerns, have not bought into it. [C1.] Security lines, weather delays and equipment failures make flying a burden for many. For Jason Green, it is a slice of heaven, virtually the only place he is not bombarded by phone calls and e-mail messages. But federal regulators are reassessing the rules barring phones in the air. [C1.] S.U.V. Sales Take a Big Drop in September Sales of large sport utility vehicles were down 43 percent in September, according to a new report, dealing a blow to General Motors and Ford Motor, which have been increasing their reliance on truck-based S.U.V.'s. Last month, G.M. saw its overall sales fall 24.2 percent and Ford's sales decline 20.3 percent. In contrast, sales at Toyota rose 10.3 percent, Honda increased 11.7 percent and Nissan 16.4 percent. [C1.] Only Thing Missing From Microsoft 's Xbox 360 Is Games In the five months since Microsoft unveiled the Xbox 360, the company has tried to generate excitement by staging demonstrations of the console's ability to play music and display digital photographs and by trumpeting its online community features. But something is missing: the games. [C1.] New Insurance Plan for Part-Time Workers Dozens of part-time workers at six large companies have begun to sign up for low-cost, limited health benefits in a national program for uninsured employees. [C2.] US Airways Repurchases Stake From a Federal Agency US Airways said it would pay $115.8 million to buy stock warrants that had given the federal government a sizeable stake in America West, which merged with US Airways last week. [C2.] Stocks Mixed Amid Concerns About Inflation Stocks were mixed after a report showed that the nation's manufacturing sector was expanding but costs were rising. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 33.22 points, to 10,535.48. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 2.11, at 1,226.70, and the Nasdaq gained 3.74, to 2,155.43. [C11.] A $3.3 Million Merger of Real Estate Companies Brandywine Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust based in suburban Philadelphia, said it had reached an agreement to acquire Prentiss Properties Trust of Dallas in a cash, stock and debt-assumption deal that the companies said was worth about $3.3 billion. Both companies specialize in the development, ownership and management primarily of office buildings. [C4.] Manufacturers Expanded Last Month, but Costs Climbed The nation's manufacturing sector shook off the impact of Hurricane Katrina and robustly expanded during September, but prices for raw materials surged, raising the prospect of higher inflation and interest rates. [C4.] Egg Producers Alter Labels Over Care Implications The label ''Animal Care Certified'' on egg cartons was supposed to assure egg buyers that hens were getting enough food, water and cage space to flap their wings. But after complaints by an animal welfare group that the labels were misleading consumers into thinking that hens were receiving indisputably humane care, the Federal Trade Commission approved a labeling change last week.
