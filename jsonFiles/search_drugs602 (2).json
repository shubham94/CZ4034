Many of the children Geiger treated were seriously malnourished, so he began writing ''prescriptions'' for food - stipulating quantities of milk, vegetables, meat, and fruit that could be ''filled'' at grocery stores, which were instructed to send the bills to the health center, where they were paid out of the pharmacy budget. When word of this reached the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, which financed the center, an official was dispatched to Mississippi to reprimand Geiger and make sure he understood that the center's money could be used only for medical purposes. Geiger replied: ''The last time I looked in my textbooks, the specific therapy for malnutrition was food.'' The official had nothing to say and returned to Washington.In some ways, the United States has come a long way since Lyndon Johnson declared the ''war on poverty.'' But in others, we're still at square one. We now have a variety of federally-supported nutrition programs, but the health care system remains senselessly disconnected from the ''social determinants of health.'' In this regard, the United States has fallen behind the rest of the world. If a politician in India announced a public health plan that neglected malnutrition, he would be ridiculed. Here, leaders make this kind of omission all the time. Almost all of the debate about the 2010 Affordable Care Act was consumed with questions about health care access and quality. But if we really want to improve the health of millions of people, we have to address the conditions that make them sick. One of the most impressive organizations in the country that is developing an approach to do this is Health Leads, which mobilizes and trains about 1000 volunteers each year who staff resource desks located in the waiting rooms of 23 hospital clinics or health centers in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, New York, Providence, R.I., and Washington. At these sites, doctors now regularly ''prescribe'' a wide range of basic resources - like food assistance, housing improvements, or heating fuel subsidies - which Health Leads' volunteers ''fill'' - applying their problem solving skills (and tenacity) to identify resources anywhere they may be available.", "headline": {"main": "Home Cure", "kicker": "FIXES"}, "abstract": "David Bornstein Fixes column highlights the work of Health Leads, an organization that tries to address the fact that social conditions may affect health more than medical care (M)", "print_page": "12", "word_count": 1604, "_id": "4fd290c88eb7c8105d868f29", "snippet": "In 1965, in an impoverished rural county in the Mississippi Delta, the pioneering physician Jack Geiger helped found one of the nation's first community health centers.
