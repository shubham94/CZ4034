Its details and sizable cost -- roughly $65 billion a year to be financed by the non-Social Security surplus -- will certainly provoke debate from all quarters, and that is a splendid development for the 45 million Americans who lack health insurance. Mr. Bradley and Vice President Al Gore, who proposed a more modest health plan earlier this month, have now made access to health care a central issue of their fight for the Democratic nomination. By elevating the issue in their party, these two Democrats make it harder for the Republican Presidential candidates to avoid engaging the issue. Mr. Bradley says his voluntary plan would be able to cover 95 percent of all uninsured people, making it the most ambitious program since President Clinton's 1993 health initiative. But at least in outline, the Bradley plan is politically smarter. It would not set up a new bureaucracy to manage the medical marketplace, and it would let consumers rely on existing private or Government insurance plans. The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim Nicholson, said the Bradley plan would lead to ''higher taxes,'' and the burden is on Mr. Bradley to show that his subsidies for insuring the poor are fiscally manageable.", "headline": {"main": "The New Politics of Health Care"}, "abstract": "Editorial contends that Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Bradley has proposed bold and expansive plan to make health insurance available to all Americans; maintains that Bradley and Vice Pres Al Gore, who has proposed more modest health plan, have made access to health care central issue of their fight for Democratic nomination; holds that by elevating issue in their party, they have made it harder for Republican Presidential candidates to avoid issue", "print_page": "28", "word_count": 383, "_id": "4fd210098eb7c8105d783a90", "snippet": "Bill Bradley has proposed a bold and expansive plan to make health insurance available to all Americans.
