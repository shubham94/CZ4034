The issue before them: whether the state should add a provision to Louisiana's drinking law that would prohibit 18- to 20-year-olds from entering bars. The law currently allows them into bars, even while it prohibits them from buying or drinking alcohol. The law is widely flouted, however, and most of the task-force members -- highway officials, state legislators, local sheriffs, a representative from Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) -- were united on the need to change what they saw as a loophole. The loophole, they believed, was encouraging college students to spend their nights carousing rather than studying. They also felt it was contributing to the carnage on the state's highways. In 1995, Louisiana had 883 traffic fatalities, of which slightly more than half were alcohol-related -- the third highest rate in the country. In seeking to close the loophole, however, the task force faced a formidable obstacle: Charles Tapp, one of its members. A lobbyist for the state alcohol industry, the silver-haired, tart-tongued Tapp was on the attack from the moment the first witness was seated. ''You're the executive director of what organization?'' he snarled at Sharron Ayers, who represented the Louisiana Alliance to Prevent Under-Age Drinking, a coalition of grass-roots groups, state agencies and private organizations. Closing the loophole, she said, would make it harder for young people to drink.", "headline": {"main": "Strong Stuff"}, "abstract": "* Citizens' groups across nation seeking to curtail sale of liquor face alcohol lobby that is aggressive, flush with cash and fortified with lessons from war on cigarettes; parents, educators and others, spurred by growing concerns over drunk driving, under-age drinking and alcohol-related crime are pressing for higher taxes, restrictions on advertising and crackdowns on problem outlets; alcohol lobby has managed to fend off these efforts, and public-health forces simply cannot compete, in terms of money, influence and connections; in Louisiana, influence of Beer Industry League is apparent in state's lax alcohol laws; George Brown, head of league, is generous donor at fund-raisers for state legislators; unlike tobacco, alcohol has not been hit with many personal-liability suits, and no state has sued industry to recoup medical costs incurred by alcohol abuse; even more important factor is industry's political power; Big Alcohol is richer, savvier and more influential than Big Tobacco; while tobacco is regional product, cultivated in handful of Southern states, alcohol has presence in nearly every state and city; photos (L)", "print_page": "36", "word_count": 7276, "_id": "4fd20bee8eb7c8105d77ae24", "snippet": "Shortly after 9 o'clock on the morning of Dec. 3, 1997, the 14 members of the Governor's Task Force on Driving While Intoxicated and Vehicular Homicide took their seats in a hearing room in the Louisiana State Capitol Building in Baton Rouge.
