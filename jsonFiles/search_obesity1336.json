Clark, the first human to receive a mechanical heart, the philosophers and social scientists at the Hastings Center here have been studying the ethical and social problems that could be created by this new development. The use of a mechanical heart to prolong life has raised considerable debate among experts in medical ethics, theologians, social scientists and the general public. Researchers who have spent nearly 20 years developing an artificial heart say that the device is a dramatic step in a much larger goal: development of a heart that is reliable, permanent and ''forgettable,'' the term the heart's chief designer, Dr. Robert K. Jarvik, uses to define his objective. But experts at the Hastings Center, who were among the first to begin studying the ethical and moral implications of the development of a mechanical heart, say there are numerous ''concerns'' that will have to be addressed now that the artificial heart has made its way into medical history. The center, which is officially known as the Institute of Society Ethics and Life Sciences, is regarded by many experts in medical and legal ethics as the world's leading research and policy-development center working on ethical, moral and legal problems in medicine and science.", "snippet": "HASTINGS AS physicians at the University of Utah Medical Center closely watched the progress of Dr. Barney B.
