Yet the offseason was less the hoped-for time of healing than a stage for tragedy, problems and more embarrassment. Two of the league's bright young players died unexpectedly, one while jogging, the other while trying to save a drowning child. Three Houston Oilers were arrested on drugs or alcohol charges. Two Cincinnati Bengals testified in court they bought cocaine. One St. Louis Cardinal was arrested on cocaine felony charges. Four of these players were suspended for four games by Commissioner Pete Rozelle for violation of league drug policy. In addition, five Dallas Cowboys were mentioned in one or two Federal drug investigations. Two Washington Redskins were arrested on drug-related charges; one was cut, and the other was suspended indefinitely by the league. The league suspended one Los Angeles Rams player for a year after he was involved in a fatal accident and was found guilty of driving while intoxicated. A quarterback from the Baltimore Colts with a gambling problem became a Federal witness against three bookmakers to whom he owed nearly $400,000. Rozelle suspended him for a year.", "headline": {"main": "AN OFFSEASON OF TROUBLES WAS A PRELUDE TO GAMES"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 6347, "_id": "4fd130b28eb7c8105d5fe370", "snippet": "GIVEN the texture of the 1982 National Football League season, which was splintered by a strike, reduced by seven games and patched together by an expanded 16-team Super Bowl tournament, it is hard to imagine how much more the league could endure...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/04/sports/an-offseason-of-troubles-was-a-prelude-to-games.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1983-09-04T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 217}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
