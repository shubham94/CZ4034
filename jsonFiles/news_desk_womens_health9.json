Like her fellow investigators on the Harvard Nurses' Health Study -- a 25-year project that has produced a trove of medical findings -- she has become a believer in the preventive power of exercise. But for Dr. Manson, a 48-year-old professor at Harvard Medical School, the great delight in the study's findings about heart disease was the realization that ''no pain, no gain'' is a myth -- that even moderate exercise makes a big difference. The Nurses' Health Study began in 1976, when more than 120,000 nurses filled out questionnaires about their habits and their health.
