Illustrated. 384 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $13.95. Gerard K. O'Neill is the Princeton University physicist who presented the case for space colonies -sealed cities orbiting Earth - in his previous book, ''The High Frontier.'' He is known in scientific circles for, among other things, designing the mass driver, a magnetic-impulse device that, he has proposed, could launch ore from the surface of the moon to be collected in space and used to build orbiting factories and cities. His popularizations of the space colony idea have been characterized by an effort to depict the future as a projection of our present tastes and preferences. In ''2081,'' he envisions a time when space colonies will have spread to the outer solar system and, in a sense, will have descended to earth as well. A fictionalized narrative, alternating with brief essays on future technology, presents this future world through the eyes of Eric C. Rawson, a visitor to Earth from Fox Cluster, a space colony beyond Pluto. Upon arriving he is fitted with a ''coded anklet'' that monitors his health, facilitates credit purchases and advises a central computer of his every movement, making ''quick and sure'' the ''accurate identification of the criminal and his tracking and arrest.''", "headline": {"main": "Nonfiction in Brief"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "15", "word_count": 1901, "_id": "4fd1108d8eb7c8105d5c6465", "snippet": "2081 A Hopeful View of the Human Future.
