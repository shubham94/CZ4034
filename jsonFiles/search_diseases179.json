Mayer, MD. Dr. Mayer graduated from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in 1976 and received the Mosby Award for Clinical Excellence at that time. It was one of many awards he would receive for a lifetime of outstanding work, including the Saul Horowitz Award and the Irma T. Hirschl Trust Career Development Award, the Jeffrey Modell Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award, the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute Award for Scientific Excellence, and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) Scientific Achievement Award. Dr. Mayer's interdisciplinary and internationally renowned laboratory focused on mucosal immunoregulation, inflammatory bowel diseases, and cytokine regulation of human B-cell differentiation. He and his team were the first to show that the epithelial lining cells of the intestine are active regulators of mucosal immune responses that are distinct from those that regulate systemic immunity. These findings had a profound significance in the development of highly effective anti-inflammatory drugs for IBD. Dr. Mayer, with support from The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, launched the IBD Center at Mount Sinai as well as established a national network of academic medical institutions for collaborative basic research in IBD. From 1980 through 1984, Dr. Mayer held joint appointments at Rockefeller University and Mount Sinai. In 1986, he was named the Chief of the Division of Clinical Immunology at Mount Sinai, and in 1990 he became Vice Chair of Medicine. Dr. Mayer was named the David and Dorothy Merksamer Professor of Medicine in 1994, and three years later, he became Professor of Immunobiology and Chair of the Immunobiology Center. He served as Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology from 2003 to 2010, and in 2007 he became Professor and Co-Director of the Immunology Institute. From 2008-2012, Dr. Mayer was also Chairman of the National Scientific Advisory Committee of the CCFA. Dr. Mayer spoke and published widely, and his research was consistently funded by the National Institutes of Health. He also leaves behind multiple generations of physicians who trained with and were mentored by him. We at Mount Sinai, and the scientific community at large, feel a tremendous loss at his death.
