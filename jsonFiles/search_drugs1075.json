Unlike the common cold, a far more familiar family plague during the school year, strep throat is much more than a pesky illness. It is debilitating, costly and dangerous. In addition to having a throat too sore to swallow water comfortably, the victims of strep throat are likely to feel sick all over. Parents, even those who remain healthy, often lose days from work to stay home with their ailing children. The obligatory visit to the doctor, throat culture and antibiotic prescription can easily cost more than $100. And failure to properly diagnose and adequately treat each and every case of strep throat can sometimes result in a very serious, even life-threatening complication: rheumatic fever.", "headline": {"main": "Personal Health"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "13", "word_count": 1161, "_id": "4fd2063d8eb7c8105d76f3e7", "snippet": "EACH winter more and more American families are plagued by recurrent strep throats that ping-pong among the children and their parents and do not quit until school finishes for the summer.

Bone marrow transplants have traditionally been used as a last resort in treating cancer patients at university-based teaching hospitals. With the development of infection-fighting drugs like nupogen, the risks have been significantly reduced, making it a more common procedure. The Hudson Valley Bone Marrow Transplant Center at St. Joseph's Hospital in Yonkers opened in 1994 and is one of about a dozen small community-based hospitals in the United States that are using the procedure to treat aggressive cancers.", "headline": {"main": "In Yonkers, the Cancer Fight Broadens"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "17", "word_count": 1100, "_id": "4fd1f0668eb7c8105d745edc", "snippet": "WHEN Joan Borgatti's doctor told her that he wanted to do a bone marrow transplant to treat her breast cancer, she thought she was going to die.
