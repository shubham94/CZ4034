We also treat patients suffering from this condition, and our experiences differ from your anecdotal references. Our evaluation of more than 1,100 workers of varying occupations and more than 300 workers' compensation patients indicates that individual characteristics, such as body mass index (a measure of obesity), age, wrist dimensions and lack of exercise, are major determinants of median nerve entrapment neuropathy, which causes carpal tunnel syndrome. Poor health habits, such as cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse and excessive caffeinated beverages also appear to affect conduction of the median nerve.", "snippet": "To the Editor:   For the last eight years, the Portland Hand Surgery and Rehabilitation Center has been investigating the causes of carpal tunnel syndrome in industrial workers, one of the disorders you discuss in \"Epidemic at the Computer: Hand and...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "NATHAN, PETER A", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "HANDS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "DATA PROCESSING (COMPUTERS)", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "26", "type_of_material": "Letter", "word_count": 286, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}, {"news_desk": "National Desk", "document_type": "article", "_id": "4fd1ced48eb7c8105d706e4e", "headline": {"main": "Panel Criticizes Weight-Loss Programs"}, "pub_date": "1992-04-02T00:00:00Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"original": "By JANE E.

Is it because television watching substitutes for exercise, or because television advertisements entice children to eat high-calorie foods, or because children snack more when in front of the set? Or is it simply that children who are fat would rather watch television than, say, play rough-and-tumble games with their friends? While all these factors no doubt play a contributing role, a Memphis researcher has found yet another explanation that should be appreciated readily by parents who have tried to get youngsters' attention while they are watching the tube. When children watch television, Dr. Robert Klesges found, they lapse into a deeply relaxed almost semiconscious state that is metabolically between resting and sleeping.", "snippet": "WHY are children who watch a lot of television fatter on average than those whose viewing habits are more limited?
