Death in the pits is part of the monotonous folk lore of mining coal. To this day, the demonstrable fact that mine safety is both variable and controllable is sometimes under appreciated, as much by coal miners as by mine owners. The point was underlined last week in Congressional testimony by investigators of the Federal Mine Safety Enforcement Agency. Appearing before a House Education and Labor subcommittee, convened to investigate the effects of budget cuts and deregulation on mine safety, the investigators cited three recent mine disasters and said that in each case ''lax inspection'' was not solely at fault. In essence the miners had killed themselves and management practices had allowed them to do so, the investigators said.", "snippet": "Because coal mining is the riskiest of heavy industrial jobs, it has nutured a pervasive fatalism.
