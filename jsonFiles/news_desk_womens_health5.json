The combination of shooting pains and numbness intensified at night, Ms. Redholtz, a 58-year-old travel consultant in Culver City, Calif., recalled. She began by consulting a podiatrist, who sent her for numerous tests over several months, but her condition was not diagnosed until an alert technician recognized her symptoms: Type 2 diabetes. Looking back, Ms. Redholtz realizes now that she had exhibited many of the classic warning signs of Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, for a long while. At the time she received the diagnosis, she was 46 years old, about 25 pounds overweight and had a strong family history of diabetes. For several years before the diagnosis was made, she had been unusually thirsty and seemed to be constantly going to the bathroom.", "headline": {"kicker": "DIAGNOSIS", "main": "With the Increase in Type 2 Diabetes Comes a Focus on Its Warning Signs"}, "word_count": 1303, "blog": [], "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd2757b8eb7c8105d8352d8"}, {"keywords": [], "pub_date": "2003-06-22T00:00:00Z", "multimedia": [], "section_name": "Health", "news_desk": "Women's Health", "byline": {"original": "By DONNA WILKINSON", "person": [{"organization": "", "lastname": "WILKINSON", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Donna"}]}, "source": "The New York Times", "print_page": "6", "subsection_name": null, "slideshow_credits": null, "abstract": null, "snippet": "STARTING as early as age 12 or 13, Wendi Perez remembers having abdominal troubles.

Ms. Monroe, who was 5 feet 5 1/2 inches and weighed between 118 to 135 pounds, may have been busty enough to fill out a size 14, but partly because sizes were smaller in the 1950's. And Barbie is indeed disproportionate -- a 1995 study found that for a woman with an average body type to attain Barbie's shape, she would need to grow 24 inches (making her more than 7 feet tall), take 6 inches off her waist and add 5 to her chest.
