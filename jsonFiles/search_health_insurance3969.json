He is an irrepressible leader, a champion of his borough and the people who live there. He has also been a lifelong squash and tennis player, but his hips gradually became so stiff and painful he could hardly walk. So in January, Mr. Hamm joined about 125,000 Americans who will undergo hip replacement surgery this year. With two new titanium joints and daily physical therapy, he will soon be ready to engage in all kinds of activities that he has been watching from the sidelines for years. The procedure was once limited almost entirely to people over 60, who would be likely to subject their new joint to less stress for fewer years than younger people. But improved techniques have removed the age barriers, and growing numbers of people in their 30's, 40's and 50's are rediscovering an active life after having crippled joints replaced with artificial ones.
