(NYT) THE POLLS McCAIN GAINS IN CALIFORNIA -- Senator John McCain has cut Gov. George W. Bush's lead in half among California Republicans, according to a poll released yesterday. Less than three weeks ago, Mr. Bush led Mr. McCain by 40 percentage points in the Field Poll. The Field Poll just released shows Mr. Bush ahead 46 percent to 27 percent. It also showed that Vice President Al Gore had slightly widened his lead over former Senator Bill Bradley among Democrats, to a 54 percent to 13 percent advantage, from a 47 percent to 19 percent spread last month. The margin of sampling error was 3.5 to 6 percentage points, depending on voter affiliation.
