The program, which will focus on developing nations, mainly in Africa, will offer testing to pregnant women and short-term therapy with the drug AZT during late pregnancy and delivery. Several studies have shown that short-term AZT therapy can sharply reduce the risk of a woman's transmitting H.I.V. to her baby. Each year an estimated two million H.I.V.-infected women worldwide become pregnant, officials of the United Nations AIDS program said. About 680,000 babies were born with AIDS last year, thrusting mother-to-child transmission to center stage at the conference.", "headline": {"main": "U.N.
