{"status": "OK", "response": {"docs": [{"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National Desk", "lead_paragraph": "As Congress returns this week from its August recess, Republicans and the White House face the difficult choice of compromise or confrontation on issues including tax cuts, gun control and regulation of managed health care. Over the break, Republicans also promised to begin a series of contentious and potentially embarrassing hearings for the Administration into accusations that Russians laundered billions of dollars through the Bank of New York, and into new revelations about the siege at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., in 1993. The first big step, however, will be President Clinton's. He is eager for Republicans to send him their $792 billion tax cut bill so he can veto it on the ground that it is too expensive. After that, the battle will begin over the fall's dominant issue: how to divide the projected $3 trillion Federal surplus among tax relief, Federal programs and debt reduction through the next decade. Republicans had counted on whipping up support for their tax bill in town meetings and other events across the country in August. But the campaign apparently failed to stir constituents from their summer diversions or shift the White House's strategy. Armed with polling data and past experience, the White House is confident that the public is on its side on the issue of taxes and spending. Mr. Clinton said in his radio address on Saturday that he would support a smaller tax package in return for Republican concessions on Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, including a voluntary prescription drug program for senior citizens. ''We think there may be the basis for looking at a middle-class tax cut at a level we can pay for, once we've done the important things on Social Security and Medicare,'' the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said on Sunday. Mr. Lockhart said $300 billion was the maximum tax relief the President was willing to accept. Congressional Republicans are divided over whether to adopt a conciliatory approach and produce some legislative gains, or stick to their core principles going into the 2000 campaign season. Aides say Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and some crucial Senate Republicans, like Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee, are willing to discuss a smaller tax package. But Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, are counseling a hard line, Republican aides say. Many Congressional Republicans also express suspicions that the President may be less interested in a grand bargain than in a legislative train wreck that he and Vice President Al Gore could use as a campaign issue. ''This latest exercise is further proof that the President does not want to admit that he is dead set against giving any tax relief to married couples, small-business owners, investors and millions of other Americans,'' said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee. Meanwhile, the greater worry both inside the White House and among some Democrats on Capitol Hill, one White House official said, is that the President, in his eagerness to strike a deal, will compromise both his and his party's principles. Aides are working to make sure he does not reach an agreement that robs Democratsof a potent campaign issue or that forces them to choose between their President and their constituents. In addition to sorting out the nation's fiscal priorities into the new millennium, Congress must pass 13 appropriations bills to keep the Government running after Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year. The House has approved 11, the Senate 9. Only two are ready to be sent to the President. The House and Senate, convening on Wednesday in what will be a light first week back to work, each resumes work on spending bills as the first order of business. Congressional appropriators have tried to devise a budget under strict spending limits outlined in the 1997 balanced-budget agreement, but they now concede it is likely that Congress will have to borrow from Social Security to pay for Government operations next year. Each party will probably blame the other if this happens. Adding to the pressure on the budget caps, President Clinton later this month will request from lawmakers several billion dollars in additional spending for fiscal 2000, including new money for drought relief, aid to earthquake victims in Turkey and peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts in Kosovo. Democrats have a long list of non-budgetary priorities whose fate remains in limbo, including gun control, managed-care regulation and an overhaul of the campaign finance system. House and Senate negotiators are to meet this month to try to reconcile juvenile-justice bills. The Senate version tightens gun control; the House bill is silent on the matter. The Senate has approved a managed-care bill; the House will probably debate and vote on at least one version this month. The House is set to debate campaign finance next week; the Senate most likely will do so next month. Republicans leaders see little political gain in any of these three divisive issues, and are likely to try to thwart all but the most minimal changes. Congressional Democrats and White House aides acknowledge that prospects are slim for any major policy achievements next year, Mr. Clinton's last in office. So Democrats have a narrow window to broker any compromises this year before the Presidential campaign season seizes all the political attention. Yet the White House has signaled that it does not need Republican cooperation to notch policy successes. ''If the Republicans come back and they're not interested, and they want gridlock, well, we're going to keep moving forward,'' Mr. Lockhart said. The Administration is considering executive actions on initiatives like clean-air regulations and promoting parental leave. With such an ambitious fall agenda, few lawmakers or aides are sanguine that the House, at least, will meet the Oct. 29 adjournment date tentatively scheduled by Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader. Indeed, John J. Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who follows Congress closely, summed up his forecast for the fall legislative season in one word: ''Pain.''", "headline": {"main": "Clinton and G.O.P.
