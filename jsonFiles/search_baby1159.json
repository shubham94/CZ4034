Townshend.

Her gynecologist had found a lump on her breast and a surgeon concluded that a biopsy was needed. Surgery was scheduled for the following Monday at 7 A.M. Mrs. Andree's husband, George, works at the Dresser Industries plant in Muskegon, Mich. Recent changes in Dresser's health insurance plan mandated that, except in emergencies, workers must get clearance from a nurse at the Aetna Life Insurance Company before being hospitalized. The surgeon's assistant, though, kept getting busy signals when she dialed the number. Mr. Andree says he got no answer at all. Dr. Donald Crandall went ahead with the biopsy. As he would later say, ''Her gynecologist said she needed an operation. A radiologist said she needed an operation. I said she needed an operation. To wait for a nurse on the phone who had never seen the patient to say it was O.K. was ridiculous.''", "headline": {"main": "WHEN THE BOSS BECOMES YOUR DOCTOR"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 3655, "_id": "4fd156548eb7c8105d63aa18", "snippet": "LORRAINE ANDREE'S rude initiation into the new world of health care began one Thursday early last October.

By Donald W. Goodwin, M. D. 234 pages. Oxford University Press. $17.95. ''No Grand Inquisitor has in readiness such terrible tortures as has anxiety,'' wrote Soren Kierkegaard in ''The Concept of Dread,'' ''and no spy knows how to attack more artfully the man he suspects, choosing the instant when he is weakest, nor knows how to lay traps where he will be caught and ensnared, as anxiety knows how, and no sharpwitted judge knows how to interrogate, to examine the accused, as anxiety does, which never lets him escape, neither by diversion nor by noise, neither at work nor at play, neither by day nor by night.'' Kierkegaard, Donald W. Goodwin writes in his new book, ''discovered anxiety in 1844.'' Surely, there were individuals before that who suffered from the unfortunate afflictions of anxiety - what Rollo May called ''a nameless and formless uneasiness,'' a vague, persistent feeling of ''uncertainty and helplessness.'' In 1621, Robert Burton expounded upon similar varieties of psychic distress in ''The Anatomy of Melancholy''; in the same century, Pascal wrote of the despair that accompanies man's realization that his life is ''swallowed up in the eternity before and behind it.'' Still, it was with the progressive loss of faith in the old certainties of religion and reason, that anxiety -along with dread and alienation - became elevated into a philosophical concept used to define the condition of modern man.", "headline": {"main": "Books of the Times; Fears and Phobias"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": 908, "_id": "4fd156558eb7c8105d63aaa6", "snippet": "ANXIETY.
