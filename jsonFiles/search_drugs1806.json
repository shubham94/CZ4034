Is it as dangerous to unsuspecting users as critics contend? Or has the drug been criticized too much, its faults magnified out of all proportion to its virtues? These and other issues will be debated by scientific advisers to the World Health Organization next month as they review the misuse and abuse of the minor tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines. The international review stems from charges that the tranquilizers are used indiscriminately for trivial reasons and that many unwary victims end up ''hooked,'' unable to quit without suffering withdrawal symptoms. Most experts acknowledge that there have indeed been such abuses, perhaps on a large scale. But many believe the problem, in the United States at least, has largely been solved by extensive publicity, moderate regulation, and a precipitous drop in use of the tranquilizers. Prescriptions for Valium in this country plunged to 33.6 million in 1980 from a peak of 61.3 million in 1975. Long the most popular drug in America, Valium now ranks fourth.", "headline": {"main": "WORLDWIDE USE OF VALIUM DRAWS NEW SCRUTINY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1034, "_id": "4fd11d398eb7c8105d5db067", "snippet": "VALIUM, one of the most intensely scrutinized drugs in recent years, is about to be scrutinized again.
