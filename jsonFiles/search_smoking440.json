The shift in care applies to about 50,000 people a year in the United States who have early cases of the most common form of the disease, non-small-cell lung cancer, and whose tumors are removed by surgery. Many of these patients, who just a few years ago would have been treated with surgery alone, are now being given chemotherapy as well, just as it is routinely given after surgery for breast or colon cancer.
