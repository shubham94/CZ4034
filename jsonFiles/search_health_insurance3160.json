Directed by Kevin Bray (R, 99 minutes). In this fast, violent caper comedy, Ice Cube and Mr. Epps reprise the hip-hop-era, Martin-and-Lewis routing they inaugurated in ''Next Friday.'' There are some funny bits and a few stylish action sequences as the pair, playing a roughneck bounty hunter (Ice Cube) and a motormouth petty con man (Mr. Epps), chase after stolen diamonds, a winning lottery ticket and an international cast of bad guys. But the light comic tone is marred by gruesome, sadistic violence, and the rabid materialism suggested by the title (which refers to $100 bills) has an ugly, cynical edge (A. O. Scott).", "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "word_count": 2126, "_id": "4fd265988eb7c8105d819b99", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series.
