A1 China Silent on Satellite Test American officials said they had been unable to get even the most basic diplomatic response from China to protests following their detection of a successful test to destroy a satellite, and Bush administration officials said they were uncertain whether China's top leaders, including President Hu Jintao, were fully aware of the test or the reaction it would engender. A3 27 Americans Killed in Iraq The United States military said that two marines died in western Iraq and an additional seven service members died on Saturday, bringing the weekend toll to 27.

A8 SCIENCE/HEALTH Coughs Lead to Health Scare A possible whooping cough epidemic at a New Hampshire medical center was exposed as a false alarm six months later.

A1 NATIONAL A12-17 Candidates Jump Start 2008 Presidential Race There are now a dozen serious contenders from both parties competing in a nomination race that for the first time in more than half a century will not include an incumbent president or current or former vice president, or even a definitive front-runner in either major party.

A16 Live Microbe Food Products In the year since the Dannon Company introduced Activia, a line of yogurt with special live bacteria, sales in United States stores have soared well past the $100 million mark.

A1 At 71, Jockey Chases Goal Frank Amonte Sr. has a goal: to become the only jockey over 70 to win a race. The wiry 71-year-old probably won't make it to the hall of fame, and has never ridden in the Kentucky Derby, but he is a survivor of a dangerous, grueling sport where broken backs, limbs and necks are common, and some of its athletes have suffered permanent disability or even death on the track.
