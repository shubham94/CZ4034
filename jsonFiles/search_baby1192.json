ANDERSON, the chairman of the Union Carbide Corporation, has not taken his wife Lillian out to dinner much in the past five months. ''I kind of felt that if somebody caught me laughing over in the corner over something,'' he said, ''they might not think it was appropriate.'' To be sure, since Dec. 3, when a chemical accident at a Union Carbide plant killed more than 2,000 people and injured thousands more in Bhopal, India, the 63-year-old Mr. Anderson has not felt much like laughing anyway. ''It must be like when someone loses a son or a daughter,'' he said. ''You wake up in the morning thinking, can it possibly have occurred? And then you know it has and you know it's something you're going to have to struggle with for a long time.'' The public ordeal of the Union Carbide Corporation since the Bhopal tragedy has been well-chronicled. The huge chemical concern has seen its stock plummet, its financial health challenged by multibillion-dollar lawsuits and the pace of its strategic acquisitions slow due to problems in raising cash.", "headline": {"main": "WARREN ANDERSON: A PUBLIC CRISIS, A PERSONAL ORDEAL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 4023, "_id": "4fd1515f8eb7c8105d632f74", "snippet": "WARREN M.

The conclusions were based on findings in 20 studies conducted since 1972, according to a spokesman for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Addressing the annual convention of the organization at the Convention Center in Washington yesterday, Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, said that women who use spermicides and birth control pills after they become pregnant but before they realize it do not increase the chances that their children will be born with defective hearts or limbs or other chromosomal abnormalities. Spermicides, which are available in a variety of gels, creams and foams and are used in conjunction with other forms of birth control or by themselves, have become a cause of public concern his year. In January, a Federal judge in Georgia awarded $5.1 million to a woman who testified that she was using a contraceptive gel manufactured by the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation when she became pregnant. She contended that the gel caused the baby she bore three years ago to be missing one arm and several fingers.
