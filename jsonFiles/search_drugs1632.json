Dr. James O. Mason, Acting Assistant Secretary for Health in the Department of Health and Human Services, told a Senate committee he had recommended that Federal spending for research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome be increased by $70 million above the Reagan Administration's $126 million request for the fiscal year 1986. That request would increase spending by about $17 million over the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Dr. Mason said the request for the $70 million more, which would be used primarily to support clinical tests of new drugs to combat the lethal disease, had been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget for review and possible submission to Congress.", "headline": {"main": "TOP HEALTH OFFICIAL AND EXPERT SEEK GREATER RISE IN AIDS MONEY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "16", "word_count": 736, "_id": "4fd148168eb7c8105d6244ed", "snippet": "The debate over the adequacy of Government financing for AIDS research intensified in Congress today as a top public health official said he had recommended an additional $70 million increase next year and a Harvard scientist said even that would not...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/27/us/top-health-official-and-expert-seek-greater-rise-in-aids-money.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "REAGAN, RONALD WILSON"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MASON, JAMES O"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BUDGETS AND BUDGETING"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By PHILIP M.

Mr. Abrams said that unreliable personnel could be dangerous in times of crisis ''when tensions are high and time for decision-making short.''
