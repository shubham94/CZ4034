The institute, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, regards marijuana as a ''dangerous drug'' that adolescents should not smoke, but it says that evidence linking the drug to disease in humans tends to be ''uncertain'' and ''unconfirmed.'' For the most part, the dangers associated with the heavy use of alcohol and tobacco are well established; together they are said to account for 30 percent of all deaths. And the potentially devastating effects of stronger drugs such as heroin, LSD and PCP - commonly known as angel dust - are well known, too. Surveys Provide New Evidence However, marijuana smokers over the last 20 years have tended to regard the drug as a comparatively innocent, recreational hallucinogen that can be smoked with relative safety. While medical experts and private and public scientific researchers had repeatedly expressed concern over the increasing use of marijuana and other mind-altering drugs by young people, their concern was just as repeatedly ignored since the use of marijuana became heavy in the 1960's.", "headline": {"main": "SURVEYS FIND YOUTHS REGARD ILLICT DRUGS AS HARMFUL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 1528, "_id": "4fd126228eb7c8105d5eccf3", "snippet": "Two surveys of high school students, one by The New York Times and the other by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, disclose a growing belief by young persons that smoking marijuana and using other kinds of illicit drugs can be harmful to their...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/20/nyregion/surveys-find-youths-regard-illict-drugs-as-harmful.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PUBLIC OPINION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUG ADDICTION AND ABUSE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Ronald", "lastname": "SULLIVAN"}], "original": "By RONALD SULLIVAN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1981-07-20T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; New York and Region"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 41}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
