Cutting down on calories, saturated fat, cholesterol or sodium is difficult at home and in the tempting atmosphere of a restaurant may seem impossible. To address this problem, the New York Heart Association has published ''Dining Out in New York City,'' a pocket guide. It may help people who have been faced with menus listing few, if any, appropriate choices, who have found restaurant management to be uncooperative, or who may not know what dishes to order. The guide is accompanied by a survey of restaurants and hotels that will accommodate special diets.", "snippet": "CONSUMERS who have been advised by physicians or nutritionists to restrict their diets or who have discovered for themselves that changes in diet have improved their health may have found at the same time that dining out has become more complicated. ...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "TERMS NOT AVAILABLE", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "46", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 774, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
