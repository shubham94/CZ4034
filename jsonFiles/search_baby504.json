At a forum in Louisville, Ky., last week, Representative Anne M. Northup, a Republican, tried to reassure about 300 intensely attentive retirees.

Alito Jr.'s nomination to the Supreme Court focus on his (losing) position in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1991 case about a Pennsylvania law that would have required women seeking abortions to notify their husbands. ''Pennsylvania has a legitimate interest in furthering the husband's interest in the fate of the fetus,'' is the most widely quoted part of his opinion in that case. There may be many reasons to oppose Judge Alito's nomination -- including the possibility, as highlighted in documents released yesterday, that he would seek to nibble away at Roe v. Wade -- but his Casey opinion is not one of them. Rather, Judge Alito's thinking about the role of men in reproductive decision-making is in keeping with how legal thinking needs to evolve in this age of readily available DNA testing.
