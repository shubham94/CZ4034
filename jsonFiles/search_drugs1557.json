''We've learned that if we have the will to provide decent care for schizophrenics, their condition could be sharply improved,'' said John Talbott, a former president of the American Psychiatric Association. But other experts say the growing ability to cope with schizophrenia is not being matched by a broad, coordinated effort to apply it. That failure, they say, is enormously costly to the nation both in the money spent for excessive hospitalization and in the shattered, unrepaired lives that result.
