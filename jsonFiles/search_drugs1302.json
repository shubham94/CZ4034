The baby he is describing was a patient in the primary care system at this hospital, the child of an immigrant mother, growing up in inner-city Boston. \"My wife and I drove up there to that neighborhood, we went to every pharmacy. The rehydration solutions cost up to $6.30 a liter. It's obscene charging this much for a product that ought to be cheaper than Coca-Cola -- it has less in it.\" A baby dies of dehydration from diarrhea in an American city in the last decade of the 20th century. A mother cannot afford $6 worth of water and electrolytes, does not understand where to go for help. It is a particularly sad, pointed illustration of what anyone who cares about children already knows: growing up in extreme poverty is bad, stunting, dangerous.", "headline": {"main": "Tackling Problems We Thought We Solved"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "55", "word_count": 5200, "_id": "4fd1e3fe8eb7c8105d72e66c", "snippet": "'So this Salvadoran woman calls up and she has a 9-month-old baby with diarrhea, and the doctor on call gave her the right advice, said go to the pharmacy and buy Pedialyte.
