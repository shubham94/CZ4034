''No big deal,'' recalled Mr. Paterson, a 19-year-old University of Colorado freshman. ''It wasn't like I was dying,'' he said. By the time the plane landed four hours later, he had an entirely different perspective. ''It feels like my head is going to explode,'' he remembers telling his mother from a phone at baggage claim. Mr. Paterson was certainly not dying, but because his sinuses were clogged and unable to decompress as the plane descended, the pressure in his skull made him feel as if he were.
