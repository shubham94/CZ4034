Behind the News -- The reviews were mixed for Ms. Couric, with many critics describing her first broadcast as a journalistic hodgepodge, mixing the serious (a report from Afghanistan) with the not-so-serious (a first photo of Tom Cruise's baby). For all the buildup about a new era at CBS News, in the end her broadcast didn't seem all that different from the others. But the opening night audience, estimated at 13.6 million viewers, was the largest for the network's signature newscast in eight years. DETROIT The News -- The Ford Motor Company brought in an aircraft industry executive, Alan J. Mulally, to help run it. Behind the News -- For William Clay Ford Jr., the company's chairman, the move was an admission that Ford needed new approaches to increase sales and profits. But some strategies Mr. Mulally adopts may end up sounding familiar to Ford executives. In overhauling the commercial aircraft business at Boeing, where he worked for 37 years, Mr. Mulally studied some Ford projects, including the development of the Taurus in the mid-1980's. MEXICO The News -- Mexico's highest electoral court declared Felipe Calder\u00f3n the country's new president, after two months of dispute. Behind the News -- Mr. Calder\u00f3n, a conservative who will take office Dec. 1, reached out to supporters of his leftist rival, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, saying he was open to some of their ideas. But Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, whose claim of widespread voting fraud was rejected by the court, would have none of it. He refused to recognize Mr. Calder\u00f3n's victory and plans to establish an alternative government. JAPAN The News -- Princess Kiko gave birth to a boy, defusing a debate in Japan about whether women should be allowed to ascend to the imperial throne. Behind the News -- The infant, as yet unnamed, was the first male born in the imperial family in 41 years. Both Princess Kiko and her sister-in-law, Crown Princess Masako, have daughters, but under the imperial system they cannot become empress. A panel of experts last year had recommended the system be changed, but action on the recommendations was postponed when Princess Kiko's pregnancy was announced. WASHINGTON The News -- Ronald Reagan will return to Washington in the form of a statue at the National Statuary Hall in the Capitol. Behind the News -- The good news for fans of Mr. Reagan was bad news for the admittedly fewer fans of another Republican, Thomas Starr King, whose bronze will be removed. King, a Civil War-era California politician who preached national unity, fell victim to rules allowing only two statues per state. In approving plans to enshrine Mr. Reagan, the California Legislature decided that the missionary Junipero Serra could stay, but that King had to go.", "headline": {"main": "New Kids on the Block | Sept. 3-9", "kicker": "THE WEEK"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 474, "_id": "4fd2afba8eb7c8105d89f27d", "snippet": "NEW YORK    The News -- Katie Couric made her debut as a network news anchor.
