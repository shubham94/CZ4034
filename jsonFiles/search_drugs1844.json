The House Appropriations Committee has already voted to reduce this amount by $4.25 million and the Senate may well vote further reductions. In the global sweep of the problems our society currently faces, this may not seem important. But it is. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Patricia Harris, said this week that in 1979 Americans spent $12.2 billion on health care - an average of $943 per person. The care that the public receives for this amount ranges from life-saving to benefits that are small or hard to measure. When an operation or treatment with a drug saves many lives, an elaborate experiment to demonstrate this fact is not apt to be required. When treatment improves a function by 5 percent, or when 5 percent of patients are improved - improvements that may be well worth the effort to achieve - it may take a very sophisticated experiment to establish that the effect is a true one, and it will require large numbers of patients or observations.", "headline": {"main": "by John Bunker", "kicker": "U.S.AID TO MEDICINE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "19", "word_count": 782, "_id": "4fd10fee8eb7c8105d5c56c3", "snippet": "The Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Education and Welfare Appropriations is expected to act shortly on the $78 million budget recommended  by President Carter for the National Centers for Health Statistics, Health Services Research, and Health...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C0CE5D61E39F93BA1575BC0A966948260", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1980-08-28T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Article", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": null, "headline": {"main": "The Region; New Cancer X-Rays Clear for Gov.
