After all, life on earth holds uncountable mysteries. Here's one that puzzles me: Why is it that no birds have evolved pregnancy? Representatives of all the other major groups of backboned animals, from guppies to skinks, have evolved to give birth - why not birds? It would surely be better for an emperor penguin to give birth than to play ice hockey with its egg. Another: Can you alter the odds of conceiving a son or a daughter by altering how often and when you have sex? Tentative evidence suggests you might be able to - but the data are deeply unclear. And how about this: What, apart from thinking, does the sperm whale use its head for? A sperm whale's head makes up about one third of its body length, and much of the space is taken up by something called the spermaceti organ - but despite much speculation (is it acoustical? A battering ram?), no one knows exactly what this does.", "headline": {"main": "Genie, I Dream of Planets", "kicker": "Opinionator"}, "abstract": "Call me a geek, but if a genie appeared before me and offered me a wish, here's what I'd wish for: detailed descriptions of at least 127 other randomly chosen planets in the galaxy, of which 63 would be home to life.
