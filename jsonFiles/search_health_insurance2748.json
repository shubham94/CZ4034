A provision of the Children's Safety Act of 2005, already passed by the House, would expand the definition of sexual activity to include simulated acts like those that appear in many movies and television shows. It would require any movie, television show or digital image including such a scene to meet the same government filing requirements, including an affidavit listing the names and ages of the actors, as pornographic films. Violators would face five years in jail. Besides depicting the proposed legislation as bad for business, the protesting organizations said that should the statute be enacted and then fail a judicial challenge, the provisions governing pornographic films would also be swept away. Among the organizations opposing the proposal are the Recording Industry Association of America, the Screen Actors Guild, Americans for Tax Reform, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Library Association. Surgery for 'Woman in White' Star Maria Friedman, left, is taking medical leave from her starring role in the Broadway production of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical ''The Woman in White'' to undergo surgery tomorrow for Stage 1 breast cancer. An announcement yesterday from the production, in previews at the Marquis Theater, said she was ''expected to require a few days for recovery before returning to the show.'' She will play tonight's performance before an understudy replaces her in the role of Marian Halcombe. The show is scheduled to open as announced on Nov. 17. Pop Goes the Met For the first time in its 123-year history, the Metropolitan Opera is presenting a female pop singer in a solo concert.

Blues for Isley A federal jury in Los Angeles has convicted the R & B singer Ronald Isley, 64, of tax evasion and failure to file a tax return, a crime that could be punished with a maximum of 26 years in prison at his sentencing on Jan. 9, The Associated Press reported. Prosecutors said Mr. Isley evaded his obligations by demanding cash payments for millions of dollars in performance fees earned between 1997 and 2002, and put homes and a yacht in the names of others. He was convicted of five counts of tax evasion and one count of willful failure to file a tax return, according to a statement from Assistant United States Attorney Thomas D. Coker. Writers Unions Settle Differences The Writers Guild of America, East, and the Writers Guild of America, west, have announced a tentative settlement of their longstanding dispute about issues including news jobs, resolution of disagreements, joint meetings and joint committees, voting eligibility and jurisdiction. They agreed that in domestic matters, anyone living west of the Mississippi was a member of the western union, and anyone east of the river was a member of the east. Abroad, all writers living in Britain and its dependencies, Ireland and Canada east of Manitoba are members of the Writers Guild of America, east; and all those in western Canada and the rest of the world are members of Writers Guild of America, west. Tax Imperils British Orchestras Taken by surprise, major British ensembles like the Philharmonia Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra are facing a cumulative and potentially crippling tax bill of $58.5 million, The Guardian of London reported. To deal with the crisis, orchestras have been holding emergency meetings with Arts Council England, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. The problem, described as arising out of the blue, is traced to an unintended consequence of a 1998 change in government regulations involving national insurance contributions by employers for ''entertainers.'' The increased payments by employers for health and social security were meant to benefit out-of-work actors. But because musicians are also considered entertainers, the tax bills of orchestras composed of freelance musicians ballooned. A Revenue and Customs survey of five sample orchestras said full payment would result in four going into bankruptcy. Country in the City With Brian Stokes Mitchell, below, and Lee Ann Womack as hosts, Broadway stars including Idina Menzel, Marin Mazzie, Andrea McArdle and James Naughton will be joined by top county recording artists like Trisha Yearwood, Carrie Underwood and Glen Campbell in ''Broadway Meets Country.''
