The total budget I present to you shows an expenditure increase of 6.8 percent - 40 percent below the projected rate of national inflation for the year ahead. In total it is an austere document. But it is a document that discerns between those public services which fundamentally require additional resources and those that do not. It spends less on general government and more on direct human services. It does not provide for increased state employment, but it redeploys manpower to meet critical human needs. It recommends resources for capital expansion, but it spends not a dollar more to house bureaucracies. This budget continues the discipline we have imposed upon ourselves over the past six years, a discipline we have learned is necessary if we are to make intelligent decisions about public priorities while annually reducing the real cost of government.", "headline": {"main": "EXCERPTS FROM GOVERNOR'S BUDGET STATEMENT LIST SOME GOALS FOR NEXT DECADE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 4197, "_id": "4fd111a58eb7c8105d5c7e7b", "snippet": "CONTENTS OF CAREY'S MESSAGE AFFIRM STATE INTENT TO ABSORB LOCAL MEDICAID COSTS   Following are excerpts from Governor Carey's budget message to the Legislature in Albany: This budget is in essence a product of an effort to re-examine our priorities...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/20/nyregion/excerpts-from-governor-s-budget-statement-list-some-goals-for-next-decade.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CAREY, HUGH L"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK STATE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BUDGETS AND BUDGETING"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1981-01-20T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "New York and Region"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National Desk", "lead_paragraph": "The number of high school seniors who daily smoke cigarettes dropped by more than a quarter from 1977 to 1980 and the rate of decline is accelerating, according to a study done for the National Institute on Drug Abuse by University of Michigan researchers here.
