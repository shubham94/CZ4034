The bill would allow banks, brokerage houses and insurance companies to merge into financial conglomerates, a long-overdue reform. The banking industry stands to gain from the right to expand into other businesses, and consumers could benefit from the ease of one-stop shopping and the creation of new financial services. But protecting consumers' financial privacy should also be central to financial modernization. This bill is weak on that score. In an electronic world where businesses can effortlessly collect, compile and mine personal data for marketing and other purposes, consumers should have the right to control the spread of their financial information. Under current federal law, consumers have almost no rights in this area.
