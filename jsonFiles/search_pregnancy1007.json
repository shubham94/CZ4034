But Flora\u2019s conception, and that of another Komodo, Sungai, who gave birth to four dragon hatchlings at the London Zoo in April through self-fertilization, are the first documented in a Komodo dragon, the world\u2019s largest lizard. Scientists are unsure whether female Komodos have always had this latent ability to reproduce, or if this is a new evolutionary development. Concerns about dwindling Komodo populations might be allayed by Flora and Sungai\u2019s self-induced motherhood. \u201cIf female dragons can on occasion help out by virgin births, more power to them,\u201d said Trooper Walsh, a United States-based Komodo dragon expert.", "headline": {"main": "Britain: Pregnant Dragon Is a Father-to-be", "kicker": "World Briefing | Europe", "print_headline": "Britain: Pregnant Dragon Is a Father-to-be", "content_kicker": "World Briefing | Europe"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "16", "word_count": "187", "_id": "54a98c6a79881040cba0ecbf", "snippet": "A Komodo dragon called Flora has surprised her keepers at Chester Zoo in northern England by laying viable eggs that are due to hatch next month.
