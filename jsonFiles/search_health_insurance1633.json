More than half of the 4.4 million jobs lost since December 2007, when the recession began, vanished in the last four months. The unemployment rate has also surged to 8.1 percent last month from 7.6 percent in January -- and from 5.0 percent when the recession began. The ranks of the unemployed now total 12.5 million people. It's fortunate, then, that the nation's first line of defense against rising joblessness -- unemployment insurance -- was reinforced in the stimulus law that passed last month. The law increases unemployment benefits by $25 a week and allows states to extend those benefits through the end of the year. It also provides $7 billion to the states to cover more than 500,000 workers -- often part-time, low-wage and female -- who are denied jobless benefits under outdated rules that apply in many states. Those states, of course, must reform their systems to specifically include those workers and to bring their programs more in line with federal guidelines.", "headline": {"main": "When Jobs Go Missing", "kicker": "EDITORIAL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "20", "word_count": 489, "_id": "4fd2b5158eb7c8105d8a7692", "snippet": "Congress and the Obama administration must be prepared to do more as unemployment worsens \u0097 as it inevitably will in this contracting economy.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/07/opinion/07sat1.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "OBAMA, BARACK"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECESSION AND DEPRESSION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (2009)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ECONOMY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNEMPLOYMENT"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2009-03-07T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Correction Appended IF you're fortunate to still have your job, but aren't sure how much longer that will be the case, lost income may not be your only worry.
