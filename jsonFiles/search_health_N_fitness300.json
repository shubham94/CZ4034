The statistic is ''new and striking,'' according to Dr. John H. Himes, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota, who described it in the January issue of The American Journal of Public Health. In an interview, Dr. Himes lamented the finding, not only because it underscores the epidemic of obesity in America, but also because it means the loss of a useful research tool. The calipers, he said, provide data about the distribution of body fat, which other measures do not yield.", "headline": {"main": "The State of Weight: Many Are Too Fat for the Calipers"}, "abstract": "Prof John H Himes reports nearly 25 percent of American women in their 50's now have so much body fat that it cannot be measured in traditional way, using skinfold caliper; photo (M)", "print_page": "7", "word_count": 773, "_id": "4fd24ea48eb7c8105d7f0bc3", "snippet": "Forging ahead on a path of seemingly endless weight gain, Americans have passed a singular milestone: nearly 25 percent of women in their 50's have so much body fat that it cannot be measured, at least not in the traditional way, which employs a...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/09/health/the-state-of-weight-many-are-too-fat-for-the-calipers.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "HIMES, JOHN H"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WEIGHT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WOMEN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Denise", "lastname": "GRADY"}], "original": "By DENISE GRADY"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2001-01-09T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health"}], "meta": {"hits": 11, "offset": 10, "time": 36}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
