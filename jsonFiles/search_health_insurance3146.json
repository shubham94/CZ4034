Directed by Ron Howard (PG-13, 129 minutes). In transforming the life of the brilliant mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. into a muzzy, triumph-of-the-human-spirit Hollywood movie, Mr. Howard and his collaborators have stripped it of anything that might present the audience with the slightest discomfort or reason to think about the documented facts concerning Mr. Nash. On its own terms, though, the movie succeeds in dramatizing Mr. Nash's mental illness and to a lesser extent his mathematical insights. Mr. Crowe's performance is honest and focused, but the movie's conceptions of intellectual life and human character are ultimately so simplistic, so deeply mistrustful of the audience's intelligence, that any chance for genuine insight is squandered (A. O. Scott).", "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "28", "word_count": 1861, "_id": "4fd26da68eb7c8105d827424", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series.
