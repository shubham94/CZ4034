That substance is sunlight, worshiped by people since earliest times for reasons that science is just now beginning to understand and extend. Findings described this month to the first wide- ranging scientific conference on the biological and medical effects of light indicate that both real and artificial light can have health benefits far beyond those imagined by science even as recently as four years ago. Researchers at the meeting described pilot studies in people using light to treat seasonal and other types of depression, jet lag and a form of leukemia. These were in addition to already established treatments for psoriasis, jaundice in newborn infants and bone loss resulting from vitamin D deficiency. And they outlined such future possibilities as light therapy to treat autoimmune system diseases, to counter rejection of transplanted organs and to target drug attacks on cancers, as well as using drugs to simulate the effects of natural light on moods and body rhythms.", "headline": {"main": "SURPRISING HEALTH IMPACT DISCOVERED FOR LIGHT"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1729, "_id": "4fd155588eb7c8105d6392c4", "snippet": "FROM now until Dec. 21, residents of the northern latitudes will experience a continuous decrease in a substance that has recently been shown to counter depression, increase alertness, inhibit sleepiness and perhaps stimulate sexual reproduction....", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/13/science/surprising-health-impact-discovered-for-light.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SUN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LIGHT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INFRARED LIGHT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Jane", "middlename": "E.", "lastname": "BRODY", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By JANE E.

Nightmares, vivid flashbacks of painful memories, acute panic attacks, chronic startle reactions and a proclivity toward violent aggressiveness are some of the difficulties reported by thousands of veterans each month. And in the view of several experts, rather than diminishing with time as might be expected, cases serious enough to warrant professional help have yet to peak, and can be expected to rise for another year or two. They say this is because the veterans, who averaged 19.2 years of age when they served, are now reaching the age when other midlife pressures exacerbate their troubling war memories. Although comparative figures on mental stress from past wars are not available, the severity of the fighting in Vietnam, the youth of the combatants and the failure to acknowledge and deal with the possibility that many soldiers were vulnerable to mental stress combined to intensify the problem, the experts said.", "headline": {"main": "VIETNAM VETERANS TURN TO THERAPY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1911, "_id": "4fd13d768eb7c8105d614352", "snippet": "THE arrival of Veterans Day seems to trigger the onset or return of mental problems among a growing number of Vietnam veterans, the legacy of unresolved emotional difficulties that stem from hostilities that ended more than a dozen years ago,...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/13/science/vietnam-veterans-turn-to-therapy.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "VIETNAM WAR"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AGE, CHRONOLOGICAL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MENTAL HEALTH AND DISORDERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "VETERANS DAY (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "VETERANS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By RICHARD D.

This state of affairs is directly traceable to Government policy. In the late 1970's, officials of the Carter Administration decided to cut off foreign marijuana at the source. They convinced Mexico to spray its crop with Paraquat, a herbicide believed by the Federal Centers for Disease Control to cause lung damage. The 30 to 40 million Americans who use marijuana panicked. They turned to marijuana from Colombia and to domestic sinsemilla, an extraordinarily potent variety that had been a limited, connoisseur's option. When the Reagan Administration launched its relatively successful ''War on Drugs'' against Colombian marijuana, once again there was an increased demand for home-grown marijuana. In 1982, Frank Monastero, then head of operations with the Drug Enforcement Agency, said: ''With the continued pressure on foreign sources, the temptation to the trafficker to seek other sources of supply, especially domestic, is irresistible.''", "headline": {"main": "A MYOPIC APPROACH TO MARIJUANA"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "31", "word_count": 670, "_id": "4fd13bac8eb7c8105d611354", "snippet": "For better or for worse, marijuana has become as American as apple pie and computers.
