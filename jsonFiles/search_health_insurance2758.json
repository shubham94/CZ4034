Since then, the fighting between rival gangs has spread to almost every corner of Mexico, leaving about 1,000 people dead and bringing harsh criticisms from Washington. 6 Democracy Groups Harassed Groups paid by the United States to promote democracy in Central Asia are under assault, not only from those governments but also from Russia, which is locked in conflict with Washington for dominance in the region's former Soviet republics. 3 Qaeda Commander Killed A senior commander for Al Qaeda was killed in what was thought to be a missile attack on a house in Pakistan, officials in Pakistan said. The man had served as the Qaeda's top planner for external operations, including those directed at the United States. 24 NATIONAL 37-45 Fewer Uninsured Children The number of American children without health care coverage has been slowly but steadily declining over the past several years even as health care costs continue to rise and fewer employers provide insurance, creating a breach that states are filling with new programs and fresh money. The overall ranks of the uninsured continue to swell, to nearly 46 million Americans at the beginning of this year. 1 New White House Strategy The 35-page document released by the White House after President Bush's speech at the United States Naval Academy is called ''Our National Strategy for Victory in Iraq.'' But a more immediate goal appeared to be victory at home, in the latest of numerous attempts by the administration to turn around flagging public support for the war. 1 Children's Bodies Identified A spokeswoman for the city of Hudson, Ohio, said dental records confirmed the identity of two bodies as those of children from New Hampshire whose father confessed to their murder before killing himself in prison. 39 Inside View of Storm Response The Louisiana state government released an estimated 100,000 pages of state documents detailing the response to Hurricane Katrina by Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco and her staff. The state compiled the documents at the request of two Congressional committees looking into the state's preparedness and response. 39 Terror Inquiry Mishandled Officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation mishandled a Florida terrorism investigation, falsified documents in the case in an effort to cover repeated missteps and retaliated against an agent who first complained about the problems, Justice Department investigators have concluded. 37 OBITUARIES 54 NEW YORK/REGION 47-53 More Black Officers Dying Four of the five New York City police officers shot dead in the line of duty since Sept. 11, 2001, were black.

M.D.S. is technically a precursor to acute myeloid leukemia. On average, its survival rates across the generational cohorts are no better than 20 percent, and far worse for a woman in her early 70's who had had cancer twice before. It wasn't that she didn't know that the biological deck was stacked against her; as someone who prided herself on her ability to grasp medical facts, she knew it only too well. In the immediate aftermath of her diagnosis, she went online to learn all she could about M.D.S. and despaired as the fact of its lethality sank in.
