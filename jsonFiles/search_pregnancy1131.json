When he takes the field today against the Vikings, 10 months into his job as Giants coach, Coughlin will be as hard to read as he was the day he was hired. Coughlin dispenses with most public appearances brusquely, as if to squelch any curiosity about what dimensions might hover behind the first. It is a hard-edged image Coughlin cares little about changing. He refuses to sweeten his coaching principles to make them publicly palatable.", "headline": {"main": "The Inner Coughlin: Behind Blue Eyes", "kicker": "PRO FOOTBALL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1660, "_id": "4fd2808f8eb7c8105d84b83f", "snippet": "When he takes the field Sunday against the Vikings, Giants Coach Tom Coughlin will be as hard to read as he was the day he was hired.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/sports/football/31giants.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2004/10/31/sports/31giants.751.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2004/10/31/sports/31giants.751.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "COUGHLIN, TOM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK GIANTS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MINNESOTA VIKINGS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOTBALL"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Lynn", "rank": 1, "lastname": "ZINSER"}], "original": "By LYNN ZINSER"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2004-10-31T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 238}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
