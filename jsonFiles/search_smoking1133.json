After three years of psychological guidance to curb the sense of urgency, competitiveness and easily aroused hostility characteristic of Type A's, 9 percent of the men had recurrent attacks, in contrast to 19 percent of a similar group who were given only standard cardiological advice about diet, exercise and therapies. The findings, released yesterday in San Francisco, show a protective effect far greater than that achieved in the recent national cholesterol-lowering study, as well as in any other coronary intervention project to date. The results are expected to draw new professional attention to Type A behavior as a risk factor in heart disease and to foster the use of psychological counseling as both a preventive and treatment. ''If changing behavior can have such a striking effect in people with well-established heart disease, it should be even more helpful to those who have not yet had a heart attack,'' said Dr. Meyer Friedman, a San Francisco cardiologist who directed the study.", "snippet": "A Federally financed study of more than 800 men who had suffered heart attacks has demonstrated for the first time that counseling to reduce characteristics of ''Type A'' behavior can cut in half the chances of suffering another attack.
