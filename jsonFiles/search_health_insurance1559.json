populate the remote Indonesian island of Sumba stopped hunting heads in the 1950s. Or at least that was what was supposed to happen. In reality, a head was lopped off in an intratribal war as recently as last March. ''We had to stop sending people on trips to the waterfall for months until things settled down,'' says Claude Graves, one of three Westerners living permanently on the island. Graves and his wife have spent the last 20 years building Nihiwatu, the most exclusive and lavish surf destination in the world. The hideaway resort draws ultrarich, \u00fcber-athletic adventurers, who come to test themselves against a legendary wave and to be surrounded by one of the last Stone Age cultures on Earth. The Dutch, who opened the East Indies in the 1600s to the spice trade, called Sumba ''Sandalwood Island.'' They relinquished control of Indonesia after World War II, and Sumba, isolated on the far end of the archipelago, became Indonesia's wild wild west. Today its few towns are little more than dusty trading posts or missionary settlements, and the majority of the 600,000 citizens live as their ancestors did: in small, widely dispersed villages. When Graves first scouted the beaches, permission to explore came only after negotiation with tribal kings. ''We had an escort of a dozen barefoot porters carrying our equipment,'' Graves remembers. ''When we came to the edge of a tribal boundary, they'd melt back into the jungle and another crew would appear and continue on with their escort.''", "headline": {"main": "Water World", "kicker": "TALK"}, "abstract": "Adam Fisher article on visit to remote Indonesian island of Sumba, home to Stone Age tribes and Claude Graves, who has spent last two decades building Nihiwatu, most exclusive and lavish surf destination in world; photos (L)", "print_page": "57", "word_count": 2099, "_id": "4fd2b7948eb7c8105d8acab9", "snippet": "At the government's request, the tribes that populate the remote Indonesian island of Sumba stopped hunting heads in the 1950s.
