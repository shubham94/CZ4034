Mesi, 32, sustained at least two subdural hematomas -- brain bleeds -- in a unanimous decision over Vassiliy Jirov in Las Vegas in 2004. The injury led to Mesi's indefinite suspension by the Nevada Athletic Commission, which was overturned in December. DE LA HOYA TO FACE MAYORGA -- Oscar De La Hoya will end a long layoff with a fight against Ricardo Mayorga, the World Boxing Council super welterweight champion, on May 6 in Las Vegas. It will be De La Hoya's first fight since he was stopped by Bernard Hopkins in the ninth round on Sept. 18, 2004. De La Hoya said he would fight twice more before retiring. COLLEGE BASKETBALL TEXAS TECH WOMEN'S COACH TO RESIGN -- Coach Marsha Sharp, 53, who won an N.C.A.A. women's basketball title at Texas Tech and turned the school into a perennial power, said yesterday that she would resign at the end of the season. Sharp's season has been marred by health problems and by Tech's dropping out of the top 25 for the first time in more than a decade. AUTO RACING NASCAR SUSPENDS HMIEL -- The driver Shane Hmiel has been suspended from competition indefinitely by Nascar after failing a third substance-abuse test. Hmiel is the 26-year-old son of the longtime crew chief and team official Steve Hmiel, and was first suspended in September 2003 after failing a substance-abuse test. PRO FOOTBALL NINERS WIN A COIN TOSS -- The San Francisco 49ers won a coin toss yesterday for the sixth pick in the N.F.L. draft in April, followed by the Oakland Raiders. Both teams finished with 4-12 records last season, tying for the sixth and seventh picks. They also tied on strength of schedule. VINATIERI MAY SAMPLE FREE AGENCY -- Adam Vinatieri may get a chance to test free agency after the New England Patriots declined to protect him with the franchise player tag. Vinatieri, who has kicked two Super Bowl-winning field goals for the Patriots, was twice the team's franchise player, including last year, when he was paid $2.5 million. This year, team would have to offer $3 million. The Patriots have until March 3 to sign Vinatieri. BASEBALL BAGWELL AND ASTROS REMAIN AT ODDS -- The standoff between the Houston Astros and Jeff Bagwell took the expected awkward turn yesterday when Bagwell arrived at spring training. He had surgery in June on his right shoulder, and the Astros argue that Bagwell is too hurt to play. They filed an insurance claim in January to recoup about $15.6 million of the $17 million Bagwell is guaranteed this season. Bagwell, 37, fielded grounders, made light throws and spent most of the team's first full-squad workout in the batting cage. He shook hands with the owner Drayton McLane, who said he wanted to meet again with Bagwell in the next few days. CLASSIC HIRES MINOR LEAGUE UMPIRES -- Unable to work out a deal with unionized major league umpires, organizers of the World Baseball Classic announced crews yesterday that are made up largely of minor league umpires who regularly fill in at the major league level. Bob Davidson, Tom Hallion and Ed Hickox were the notable names among the 31 umpires hired for the tournament. The three were among the 22 who lost their jobs during a 1999 labor dispute. CYCLING LANDIS MAINTAINS HIS LEAD -- George Hincapie joined Juan Jose Haedo of Argentina as a double-stage winner while Floyd Landis kept the race lead yesterday in the Tour of California. Hincapie again used his Discovery Channel teammates' strong support to sprint to victory in the 105.3-mile fifth stage in 3 hours, 52 minutes, 2 seconds. STEROIDS PROBATION FOR KORCHEMNY -- Remi Korchemny, the track coach in the Balco doping scandal, was sentenced to a year of probation yesterday by a federal judge who said she was moved by stories of his tireless coaching of track athletes, many of them amateurs.
