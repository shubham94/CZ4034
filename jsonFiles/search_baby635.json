He was 81 when he completed the job. ''For all its imperfections,'' he wrote, ''I consider it my masterpiece.'' The austerity of the chapel is striking. A small modern building on the grounds of a residence of Dominican nuns, it displays three black-and-white murals -- ''The Way of the Cross,'' ''Virgin and Child'' and ''St. Dominic'' -- as well as three semi-abstract stained-glass windows. Matisse also designed the stone altar, a bronze cross, colorful vestments and the carved door to the confessional.
