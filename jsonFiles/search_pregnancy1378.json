Museums ''THE CHANGING FACE OF LIBERTY: FEMALE ALLEGORIES OF AMERICA,'' New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Sept. 3). Uncle Sam, the allegorical male personification of the United States, has always had a female counterpart, the damsel dressed in flowing robes who came to symbolize Liberty. As a sequel to its ''Uncle Sam'' show, the historical society mounted this very lively display of his iconic sister in her many guises, from ''L'Amerique,'' an Indian princess with feathers in her hair who represented the New World in early maps, to the matronly Lady Liberty portrayed in the Bartholdi statue in New York Harbor. The fascinating story of Liberty's evolution is told in posters, cartoons, illustrations and photographs.
