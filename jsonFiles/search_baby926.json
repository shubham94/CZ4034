Use of the new questions follows an uproar over the nomination of Zoe Baird to be Attorney General and the withdrawal of another candidate for the same job, Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood of New York. George Stephanopoulos, the White House spokesman, said that in view of those events candidates for Presidential appointments in the Clinton Administration would probably be disqualified if they had hired illegal aliens in the last six years. New Standards Imposed The hiring of illegal aliens was prohibited by a law adopted in November 1986. Asked if President Clinton would appoint any people who have employed illegal aliens since then, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, \"I think it would make it very difficult, and it would probably be disqualifying, yes.\" Administration officials said Mr. Clinton would probably not nominate individuals who hired illegal aliens before November 1986 because people would find it difficult to distinguish between the two situations in political debate.", "headline": {"main": "CLINTON NOMINEES WILL BE SCREENED FOR ILLEGAL HIRING"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2646, "_id": "4fd1db8e8eb7c8105d71ca36", "snippet": "All candidates for the hundreds of Government jobs subject to Senate confirmation are now being asked if they had hired illegal aliens or violated tax laws on household workers, Clinton Administration officials said today, and at least a dozen people...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/09/us/clinton-nominees-will-be-screened-for-illegal-hiring.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BAIRD, ZOE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CLINTON, BILL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "STEPHANOPOULOS, GEORGE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WOOD, KIMBA M"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SKAGGS, DAVID E"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BROWN, RONALD H"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "JUSTICE DEPARTMENT"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "APPOINTMENTS AND EXECUTIVE CHANGES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ILLEGAL ALIENS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STANDARDS AND STANDARDIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TAXATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WOMEN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ATTORNEYS GENERAL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "IMMIGRATION AND EMIGRATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIDES AND EMPLOYEES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SOCIAL SECURITY (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DISCRIMINATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOMESTIC SERVICE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BABY SITTERS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Robert", "lastname": "PEAR"}], "original": "By ROBERT PEAR"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1993-02-09T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Front Page; U.S.; Washington"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 73}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
