They berated him for being too cozy with the Clinton White House, for the shabby tricks agents played on Richard Jewell when he was a suspect in the Atlanta bombing case, for violating the rights of leading Republicans by supplying confidential security files to a low-level White House employee -- even for Waco and Ruby Ridge, disasters that occurred well before he became F.B.I. director in September 1993. Freeh was questioned about the sloppy science at the scandal-ridden F.B.I. forensics lab, about the bureau's failure to upgrade its plodding criminal- records computers and its glacially slow fingerprint division, which still depends on bleary-eyed clerks who have to thumb through inky index cards, sometimes taking up to six months to come up with a match. ''I've always had tremendous faith in the credibility and integrity of the F.B.I., and I still have faith in the rank-and-file F.B.I. agents,'' Chairman Robert L. Livingston of the House Appropriations Committee told Freeh in front of one packed hearing room last March. ''But I think the leadership of the F.B.I. has brought the entire organization into question. And you are the leader.'' It was a harsh rebuke, given the deference with which F.B.I. directors have traditionally been received on Capitol Hill, especially from Republicans like Livingston. But Freeh's response was the big surprise. He agreed with Representative Livingston. Yes, the forensics lab had done sloppy work; yes, the F.B.I.'s handling of the Atlanta bombing showed terrible judgment, and no question about it, handing over those Republican files was a lamentable violation of the individuals' right to privacy. Freeh described the reforms he was putting into effect to prevent similar mistakes in the future, but he accepted responsibility, not just for the sins perpetrated on his watch, but for mistakes that had happened even before he got there.", "headline": {"main": "Running the F.B.I."}, "abstract": "Bruce Porter article on efforts of Federal Bureau of Investigation Dir Louis Freeh to reform agency; cites his success in improving morale and morality and in disarming some Congressional critics with candor about problems; notes civil libertarians are concerned about failure to institute mechanisms to make increasingly powerful FBI more accountable, while FBI's old guard holds his eagerness to acknowledge mistakes has damaged FBI's credibility and effectiveness; photos (L)", "print_page": "40", "word_count": 7092, "_id": "4fd214308eb7c8105d78c27f", "snippet": "He had interrogated suspects in back rooms as an F.B.I. agent, made witnesses sweat when he was a United States Attorney and sat in judgment from the Federal bench, but Louie Freeh had never been in the hot seat himself, not the way he was last...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/02/magazine/running-the-fbi.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "FREEH, LOUIS J"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REFORM AND REORGANIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPANY AND ORGANIZATION PROFILES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Bruce", "lastname": "Porter"}], "original": "By Bruce Porter"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1997-11-02T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 2, "offset": 0, "time": 36}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
