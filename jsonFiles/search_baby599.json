It was among the first suspended roller coasters in the world, a new breed of rides that dangled people in harnesses beneath the tracks. Plunging down the first hill, Ms. Benagh felt something go terribly wrong. She said the harness loosened to the point that her head began to whip around as the ride zoomed up, down and around. ''At the bottom of the hill my head was forced back and hit the back of the seat,'' she said. ''On the loops, my head knocked against the sides of the headrest. I passed out briefly. When the ride halted, I was dazed. I had to steady myself against a pole in order to stand.''", "headline": {"main": "When Brain Trauma Is at the Other End Of the Thrill Ride"}, "abstract": "Article on growing number of brain trauma injuries associated with rides on normally-functioning hypercoasters; New Jersey will become first state in US to limit gravitational force on rides; at least two studies are underway to determine whether cause-and-effect relationship exists between brain injuries and amusement park rides; photo; diagrams; chart (M)", "print_page": "5", "word_count": 1684, "_id": "4fd27f5c8eb7c8105d8496c6", "snippet": "Deborah Lee Benagh was at Six Flags Elitch Gardens in Denver when her sons coaxed her onto its daring new attraction, a giant serpent of loops and inversions ominously called Mind Eraser.
