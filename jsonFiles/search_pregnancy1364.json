But it was hard to tell from comments by the justices how far the court will go to discourage further attempts by Congress and the states to ban particular abortion procedures or tinker with the still-sound architecture of Roe v. Wade. The court was hearing Nebraska's appeal of a lower federal court ruling last year. That ruling tossed out the state's partial birth ban on grounds that it placed an ''undue burden'' on a woman's exercise of her constitutional right to abortion -- the standard the court set the last time it plunged into the abortion wars eight years ago. The undue burden arose, the lower court said, because the state criminalized a procedure that ''has no fixed medical or legal content'' and was so ill defined that it was potentially applicable to common techniques used for abortions early in pregnancy.", "headline": {"main": "Considering Abortion and Gay Scouts"}, "abstract": "Editorial reports encouraging signs that majority of Supreme Court justices are prepared to defend women's health and reproductive freedom against proliferating bans on vaguely defined surgical procedure dubbed 'partial-birth abortion'; hopes Court will not pass up chance to support right of homosexuals to belong to Boy Scouts, in case involving New Jersey scoutmaster James Dale", "print_page": "20", "word_count": 508, "_id": "4fd230cc8eb7c8105d7bf81f", "snippet": "There were encouraging signs yesterday that a majority of Supreme Court justices are prepared to defend women's health and reproductive freedom against the proliferating bans on a vaguely defined surgical procedure dubbed partial birth abortion.
