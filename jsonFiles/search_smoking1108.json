The scientists said that a long-term study of more than 1,000 graduating medical students, followed for up to 38 years, found that 51 have so far either died suddenly of heart failure or suffered heart attacks or severe heart pain. Those who drank five or more cups of coffee per day had a 2.8 times greater risk of having the heart problems than those who drank no coffee. Dr. Thomas A. Pearson, a co-author of the report, called the findings ''preliminary'' but suggested that an individual who has taken the standard steps to avoid heart disease, such as quitting smoking and having blood pressure and cholesterol levels checked, might additionally want to limit coffee consumption to two cups a day as part of ''a prudent life style.''", "snippet": "Scientists from the Johns Hopkins Medical School reported today that a person who drinks five or more cups of coffee a day is almost three times as likely to develop heart problems as a person who drinks no coffee at all.
