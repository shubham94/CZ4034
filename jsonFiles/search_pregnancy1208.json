Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Now Playing ''BIG FISH,'' starring Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney and Billy Crudup. Directed by Tim Burton (PG-13, 110 minutes). This soft, thin magic-realist fable concerns the fabulous (and largely self-fabricated) life of Edward Bloom, a garrulous Southerner played in his youth by Mr. McGregor and on his deathbed by Mr. Finney. Edward is a devoted teller of tall tales, which charms everyone except his son, Will (Mr. Crudup), who must overcome this estrangement before his father's death. There is an interesting family drama hidden behind all the whimsy and moonshine, but the movie is so steadfast in its admiration for Edward and his inventions that it never considers that Will might have a point. The movie, as a consequence, lacks one as it wanders through a series of cute, fairy-tale episodes featuring, among other things, a glass-eyed witch, a pair of conjoined Korean chanteuses and a town in which nobody wears shoes. Mr. Burton's imagination, so wild and marvelous in movies like ''Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,'' ''Edward Scissorhands'' and ''Beetlejuice,'' seems to have been tamed. Rather than resonating with the uncanny magic of the unconscious, his images seem to be part of a strategy of denial, intended to obscure the possibility that Edward, a charismatic raconteur, might also be a narcissist and a compulsive liar. Will may forgive these lapses; that is a son's prerogative, after all. Far worse, from the audience's point of view, is that Edward is also a bit of a bore (A. O. Scott).", "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "42", "word_count": 2979, "_id": "4fd235d68eb7c8105d7c798e", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film.
