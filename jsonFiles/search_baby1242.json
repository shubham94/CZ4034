Pyle supports the Reagan Administration proposals to require working Americans to pay income tax on the health insurance premiums paid by their employers over and above a certain amount. Not collecting the tax, he said, ''encourages more expensive, full-coverage health insurance,'' and he believes that ''the distortions this tax break creates have contributed to waste and mismanagement in health care.'' We strongly support improved management of health care and reduction in the overutilization of health-care services. But the ''tax cap'' proposal, endorsed by Mr. Pyle, is a very clumsy way of accomplishing those objectives. We fear, too, that it may cost more in higher hospital utilization and administrative costs than the Government will collect in increased revenues.", "headline": {"main": "COUNTERPRODUCTIVE 'TAX CAP' ON HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": 457, "_id": "4fd12a1d8eb7c8105d5f2321", "snippet": "To the Editor:    In an Op-Ed article published Feb. 28, Thomas O.
