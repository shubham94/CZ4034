That block and its surrounding blocks now hold the largest concentration of homeless people in the city, a fact of life that troubles the homeless families, the residents and the merchants - indeed, everyone who lives or works there. Life in this neighborhood, just south of midtown, is now hard and loud and dangerous, all agree. Many there say poor planning by the city is to blame. The homeless, they contend, have been crammed into tiny hotel rooms in a neighborhood without playgrounds or Laundromats or even grocery stores - living under conditions that stunt the families and hurt the neighborhood.", "headline": {"main": "EAST 27TH ST.: A QUIET AREA TURNS TOUGH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1220, "_id": "4fd15d028eb7c8105d643bbd", "snippet": "On one block of East 27th Street right off Fifth Avenue, there are three hotels, the Prince George, the Madison and the Latham, which together house more than 600 homeless families with 1,500 children - more homeless people than in all of Queens, the...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/13/nyregion/east-27th-st-a-quiet-area-turns-tough.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "MANHATTAN (NYC)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "PRINCE GEORGE HOTEL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "LATHAM HOTEL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MADISON HOTEL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOMELESS PERSONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOTELS AND MOTELS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Barbara", "lastname": "BASLER"}], "original": "By BARBARA BASLER"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1986-06-13T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "New York and Region"}, {"type_of_material": "Series", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Science Desk", "lead_paragraph": "His head affixed to a frame on an operating table, Meyer grabs at his left arm, struggling to remove the blood-pressure collar.
