But the longterm benefits of the operation remain in doubt for a large proportion of patients. Studies defining its role for different groups of patients are still under way, and those studies completed so far have often shown conflicting results, depending in part on the length of followup. Continuing studies indicate that, with time, bypass patients may do better than they seem to in the early years of a study.", "snippet": "EACH year, more than 100,000 persons undergo coronary bypass surgery at a total cost far exceeding $1 billion, more than the entire budget of either Delaware or Maine.
