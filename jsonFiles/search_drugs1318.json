He approaches homeless people with a camera crew and asks who they are, how they became homeless and what they do to survive. The answers, while not surprising, give individual faces to problems that are too easily reduced to generalities. \"The American ideal of freedom and justice is out of sync with the facts,\" he concludes, after having amassed sad and persuasive evidence to corroborate that statement. The testimony of many homeless people would have been a sufficiently urgent basis for any documentary film on this subject. But Mr. Brand goes further, offering a disquisition on the connections between the condition of the homeless and the consequences of studying it as a series of images. Those images, he maintains, have the effect of distancing a viewer from reality. That point may be accurate, but for a film maker it is also academic and somewhat self-defeating.", "headline": {"main": "Problems of Homeless: The Individual Stories"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 724, "_id": "4fd1bc978eb7c8105d6e8784", "snippet": "In his documentary \"Home Less Home,\" Bill Brand does something that should not be as unusual as it is.
