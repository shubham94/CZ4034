Clues have been found in juvenile, or type 1 diabetes, the most serious form of that disorder, and in many other diseases that involve derangements of the immune defense system. The diseases under study are extremely varied. Among them are multiple sclerosis, a disease of the nervous system; systemic lupus erythematosus, a serious inflammatory disease of connective tissue; Graves' disease, which affects the thyroid; Addison's disease, a disorder of the adrenals; myasthenia gravis, which affects the muscles, and, most recently, even narcolepsy, the disorder in which the patient is likely to drop off to sleep virtually anywhere at any time for reasons that are totally obscure. The focus of the studies is a group of substances called human leukocyte antigens, or HLA. Leukocytes are white blood cells. An antigen is anything that can provoke attack by antibodies, the defensive foot soldiers of the immune system. Human leukocyte antigens, which are located on the surface of the white blood cells, came to scientific notice more than a decade ago because they were found to be vital in matching compatible recipients with donors for the transplantation of kidneys, hearts or other organs.", "snippet": "SCIENTISTS are making important progress in unraveling the nature and significance of a special group of hereditary factors associated with susceptibility to some of the most serious and baffling of human diseases.
