Even President Bill Clinton adopted policy after policy that disproportionately benefited those who made the most money. I am referring to what are commonly called ''tax expenditures.'' These are credits to and deductions from federal income taxes that usually reward some kinds of spending or saving. When businesses deduct the health care benefits they pay employees, for example, it is a sizable loss of revenue to the government.
