A large pane of the window was accidentally hit by a pebble a few months back, and because there has been no time to replace it, the shatterproof glass remains marbled and glittering, distorting the view. It is somehow fitting that Marcia E. Herman-Giddens looks through that mottled glass every day, reflecting on the hodgepodge of a debate that her research has wrought.

Since then, she has watched as all types of scientists -- from endocrinologists and primatologists to psychologists and anthropologists -- have scrambled to figure out why. Meanwhile, the musings of those scientists have gotten caught up in the times and taken on lives of their own.", "snippet": "The rustic, eclectic house on the farthest outskirts of Chapel Hill, N.C., is a kaleidoscope of contradictions.
