And Albany isn't helping. On Long Island, the Nassau County executive, Thomas Suozzi, confronts a fiscal double whammy. Not only must he surmount the current economic downturn, but he must do so even as he grapples with the financial crisis left behind by his Republican predecessor, Thomas Gulotta. Mr. Suozzi's 2003 budget proposal shows him moving aggressively to balance the books and overhaul creaky government operations. For example, his plan contemplates shrinking the county payroll by 1,400 workers -- a reduction of about 15 percent over the next 12 months. It also includes the 19.4 percent increase in the county portion of the property tax bill, which the Legislature's Democratic majority approved last spring. He has warned that future tax increases may be necessary if the economy does not rebound, mandated costs continue to rise or unions refuse givebacks.", "headline": {"main": "A Double Whammy on Long Island"}, "abstract": "Editorial says Nassau County Executive Thomas Suozzi is confronting fiscal double whammy: current economic downturn and financial crisis left behind by his Republican predecessor Thomas Gulotta; says Suozzi is right to inform public about some real trade-offs ahead", "print_page": "18", "word_count": 383, "_id": "4fd220028eb7c8105d7a370f", "snippet": "Faced with sluggish sales tax revenues and soaring pension, health insurance and Medicaid costs, counties in the New York metropolitan region are facing cuts in popular services and hikes in local taxes to balance their budgets.
