H.A.E.S. is based on the idea that \"the best way to improve health is to honor your body,\" and it supports the adoption of good health habits simply for the sake of health and well-being rather than weight control.Bacon and Lucy Aphramor, a National Health Service specialist dietitian and an honorary research fellow at the Applied Research Center in Health and Lifestyle Interventions at Coventry University in England, published a paper in Nutrition Journal earlier this year. It argues that a weight-focused approach geared toward losing weight is - surprise! - not especially effective in either reducing the weight or creating healthier bodies.
