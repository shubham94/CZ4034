The benefits to the baby of breast-feeding are not in question. They include improved resistance to infection, less risk of allergies and, presumably, psychological comfort. But what about the mother? A new study monitored psychological, physical and sexual factors among 19 Australian mothers every day for two months before and two months after they weaned their first babies. The women kept daily records of 14 measures of psychological, physical and sexual variables, noting them at the same time each day on a three-point or five-point scale of well-being. All were considered in good physical and psychological health and had been nursing their babies for 6 to 23 months.", "snippet": "PUBLICITY about the benefits of breast-feeding has prompted many women who might otherwise have weaned their babies after a few months to continue to nurse them for six months or longer.

Kessler, head of the Food and Drug Administration, to demonstrate that the cigarette is a means of transmitting nicotine into the body and hooking smokers and hence belongs under his agency's regulatory aegis.
