Public concern has focused on such ''1984'' questions as whether people are being influenced by invisible exhortations to ''eat popcorn'' flashed between the frames of movie films, or whether the word ''sex'' is imprinted in microscopic type on every Ritz cracker to make the crackers more appealing, or whether minds are being manipulated by inaudible messages broadcast among the sounds of Muzak. Most major advertisers have disavowed the use of subliminal techniques, though it is impossible to verify their contentions since, by definition, subliminal messages are beyond the limits of conscious perception.
