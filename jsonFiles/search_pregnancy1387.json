But the familiarity is deceptive, which simply adds another layer to Mr. LaBute's insistent investigation of the nastiness lurking beneath the most placid exteriors. As a filmmaker (''In the Company of Men'') and a playwright, he specializes in exhuming the worm within. Evil isn't always interesting, he insists. It exists in the blandest of men and women.

Surrendering yourself to this well-acted film is never a question of wondering when the last shoe will drop, but one of how much you'll allow yourself to identify with its likable but foolish lovers, who break the strict social rules of their claustrophobically dingy community and pay the usual price. That community is an impoverished Welsh coal mining village in 1911. Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd) is the eldest son in a devout Orthodox Jewish family that has recently migrated to Wales from Russia and has set up a pawnshop that doubles as a drapery business. One of Solomon's tasks is to go from door to door of the miners' cottages across the hill, peddling swatches of cloth that can be made into dresses. One day he stops at the door of Gaenor's strict, churchgoing family.

Just ask James Blake. ''When I last played him about a year ago, he wasn't doing it at this level,'' Blake said yesterday after Levy defeated him, 7-5, 6-2, in the United States Open qualifying to earn a berth in the main draw. Levy, a 22-year-old Israeli, qualified for the main draw because Mariano Zabaleta, Nicolas Escude and Andrei Medvedev pulled out. That leaves an additional three openings for so-called lucky losers, the top-ranked qualifiers who lose in the third round but get in the draw because of other withdrawals. As the top-seeded qualifier, Levy automatically gets in even if he loses his third-round qualifying match today. Levy, who had been ranked No. 144, emerged recently to reach the final of a major tournament in Toronto. He is now ranked 70th. About 1,500 spectators nearly packed the Court 7 grandstand of the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park to watch Levy finish off Blake with a hard serve. BALCELLS FALLS: Juan Balcells was celebrated by Spain when he and Alex Corretja beat Todd Martin and Chris Woodruff in doubles to clinch the Davis Cup semifinal against the United States in July. Yesterday on Court 8, Balcells was just another journeyman. To put a polite spin on what a certain Davis Cup coach asked: Who the heck is Juan Balcells? ''I'm not a hero and I don't usually lose in the first round of a qualifier,'' Balcells said after falling to Frantisek Cermak, 4-6, 7-6 (6), 3-6. Balcells earned his five sets of fame when John McEnroe made light of him before last month's Davis Cup tie between the United States and Spain. Balcells answered with a gritty performance in doubles, then upset Jan-Michael Gambill in singles to give Spain a 5-0 sweep. Days later, the 111th-ranked Balcells lost to Christian Ruud, 6-2, 6-2, in the first round of a tournament at Kitzbuhel, Austria, and has not played since. LUCIC IS ALMOST IN: Mirjana Lucic, a Wimbledon semifinalist last year who dipped from 32nd to 203rd in the rankings, is one victory from the United States Open after defeating Evelyn Fauth, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1. It was a rare second straight triumph for Lucic, who was eliminated in the first round of six straight tournaments at one point this season. PREGNANT PLAYER LOSES: Lindsay Lee-Waters, nearly five months pregnant and almost four years removed from when she was ranked 36th, was tied at 3-3 in the deciding set against Na Li before leg cramps set in. Lee-Waters did not win a game from then on, and Li prevailed by 7-5, 4-6, 6-3. Lee-Waters said her pregnancy had a little effect, but I just wasn't accurate enough with my shots.
