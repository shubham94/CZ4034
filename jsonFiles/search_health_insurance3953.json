But in his 1996 novel, ''Holy Fire,'' Sterling imagines a rather different future: a world ruled by an all-powerful gerontocracy, which appropriates most of the world's wealth to pay for ever more costly life-extension techniques. And his heroine is, believe it or not, a 94-year-old medical economist. When the novel first came out, it seemed that Sterling was behind the curve. Public concern over medical costs peaked about four years ago, then dropped off sharply. Not only did the Clinton health care plan crash and burn, but the long-term upward trend in private medical costs also flattened, as corporations shifted many of their employees into cost-conscious H.M.O.'s. Even as debates over how to save Social Security make headlines, few question budget plans by both Congress and the Administration, which assume, while being systematically vague about the details, that the growth of Medicare can be sharply slowed with few ill effects.

In Russia: 64. In Laos: 50. ...AND PROSPER? Since 1959, the proportion of all people 65 or older living in poverty has dropped from 35 to 11 percent. Social Security accounts for most of this change. Because of Medicare, less than 1 percent of Americans 65 and over are without health insurance, compared with 15 percent of the general population. In 1965, 63 percent of blacks 65 or older lived below the poverty line. Today, 25 percent do. The proportion of men 65 or older who work full time has dropped dramatically, from 46 percent in 1950 to 16 percent in 1993. But the proportion of women the same age who were working in 1993 (8 percent) is only slightly less than in 1950 (10 percent). Number of C.E.O.'s over 65 who were running Fortune 500 companies in 1995: 41. Number who were women: 1, Marion O. Sandler of Golden West, who still holds the office jointly with her husband. The median income for men and women over 65 rose more than 170 percent from 1947 to 1995, mostly because of Social Security benefits. The median income for the overall population in the same time span rose 49 percent. But now, as then, women end up with about 57 cents on the male dollar. Grandparents buy one-quarter of all toys sold. The average age of buyers of American-made luxury cars is 65. More than 80 percent of 60- to 75-year-olds own their own homes, compared with 66 percent of the population at large. People over 65, who constitute 13 percent of the U.S. population, own 18 percent of the property. They own 1 in 7 multi-family homes and 1 in 4 single-family homes. Women over 65 are much poorer than men - because they generally earn less throughout their careers and because widows receive only two-thirds of their husbands' Social Security benefits. As recently as 1992, nearly one-fourth of white women living alone and more than half of black and Hispanic women living alone were poor. White men age 65 to 74 commit suicide at a rate nearly 5 times that of white women and 14 times that of black women. THE GENDER GAP For every 100 women over 65, there are only 77 men because a higher proportion of men die at every age. Demographers expect the gap to narrow in the next century, as more men live longer. Women over 65 are three times as likely as men to be widowed. Widowers over 65 are 7 times as likely to remarry as widows. STRENGTH IN NUMBERS In 1996, those 60 and older represented 23 percent of the voting-age population and 23 percent of those who voted. In the 1994 Congressional elections, 45 percent of those over 60 voted, while 36 percent of those under 60 voted. Forty-nine percent of those 65 and older believe that Federal spending on education should be increased, compared with 67 percent of people ages 18 to 64. When asked which major political party they identified with, people over 65 were more Democratic (39 percent vs. 31 percent) and less independent (26 percent vs. 34 percent) than those younger. Yet they voted almost identically to the rest of the population in the Presidential election of 1996. MORE THAN JUST BINGO According to a survey done in 1995 for Parade magazine, 40 percent of people 65 and older are sexually active and have sex an average of 2.5 times a month (compared with 7 times a month for those under 65). Seventeen percent of seniors reported having a ''high sex drive,'' and 25 percent characterized their lovemaking abilities as ''excellent'' or ''very good.'' Half of those in committed relationships are satisfied with the quality of their sex lives. Travelers 50 and older account for 72 percent of R.V. trips, 70 percent of bus trips and 70 percent of cruise passengers. In 1996, more than 323,000 people went to Elderhostels, one- to four-week-long mini-colleges for seniors that offer course work and accommodations. About 10 percent of those over 50 live in restricted retirement communities, while almost half of Arizonans over 55 live in such communities. Magazine with the oldest readership: Modern Maturity, the highest-circulation magazine in the country (20 million), with a median age of 64. SECOND ACTS In 1996, three artists 65 or older had Billboard top 100 pop albums: Andy Griffith, 70; Frank Sinatra, 81, and John Williams, 65. The age Tony Randall will be when his first child is born this spring: 77. Number of 1996 films with a lead role played by an actor 65 or older: 18. Number of women over 65 with a lead movie role in 1996: 1, Jeanne Moreau, 69. Top five shows among those 65 and over: ''60 Minutes,'' Touched by an Angel,'' Diagnosis Murder,'' ''Cosby'' and CBS Sunday Movie.'' All five air on CBS.
