''One of the things we say, partly in jest, is that if you heard it in the dressing room, don't believe it,'' he said. Here's a short primer of reasonable tax deductions artists can trust. As the typical tax disclaimer goes: individual circumstances may vary. And be sure to save those receipts. COSTUMES: For the most part, the cost of an actor's clothing cannot be deducted as a business expense, even if it is worn solely for an audition, a rehearsal or onstage. Nor can garb purchased to wear on the red carpet at the Oscars tonight. There is one notable exception: ''If you can't sit down in it, like some clown costume or some science-fictiony thing, you can treat it as a professional expense,'' said Frederick M. Stein, a tax lawyer and analyst for RIA, the tax and accounting publishing house. HEALTH CARE: Most medical and dental expenses are not fully deductible for actors and artists. Elective procedures like breast enhancement and teeth whitening almost never are. But as one benchmark case suggests, dental work caused by an on-the-job accident can qualify. In the 1920's, Reginald Denny, an actor under contract with Universal, succeeded in getting a business expense deduction of the full $400 he paid for dental bridgework. The reason: his teeth were knocked out during the filming of a boxing movie. PROFESSIONAL TRAINING: Ordinary enthusiasts cannot deduct the cost of professional training like private voice lessons or a dance class. But for working performers, Mr. Fowkes said, those costs can qualify as educational expenses if the coaching improves a specific skill set. Hilary Swank, for example, could deduct the cost of the boxing training she received for her role in ''Million Dollar Baby'' if she paid for it out of pocket. Still, health club and gym memberships are generally not deductible. From the I.R.S. standpoint, the cost of keeping fit is considered a personal expense. WORKSPACE: A professional artist can deduct a portion of the cost of a home studio, whether rented or owned, if there is proper documentation. The sculptor, for example, who dedicates some space in his home exclusively and regularly for his work can deduct a percentage of the rent as a business expense. For the artist who owns, a share of the depreciation on the house is deductible as well as a portion of the insurance and utility costs. Depreciation on specialized business equipment, like a kiln, is also deductible. Of course, one writer went too far. In the 1990's, Pennel Phlander Irwin, an unpublished novelist, tried to claim that all his living expenses were deductible because his entire life went into his writing. As one might expect, the I.R.S shot that claim down. SUPPLIES: Professional artists are entitled to take a tax deduction for materials they use in their art. The painter can deduct the cost of his paints; the photographer, the cost of her film. The performance artist? ''If you buy chocolate sauce to smear all over yourself while doing a piece of performance art, then yeah, you can go ahead and deduct it,'' Mr. Stein said. Just be sure you can prove that it was being used for business purposes.
