But all varicose veins have the potential for serious complications and, therefore, should be examined by experts, said Dr. Hesmat Majlessi, a vascular surgeon who heads the Rye Vein Care Center in Rye. Dr. Majlessi is a member of the American Phlebology Society of America and adapted his techniques of treating varicose veins from Dr. George Fegan of England, a pioneer in the field. He is skeptical of common methods of treating varicose veins because, he said, they do not usually cure the problem but just treat the symptoms.", "snippet": "IT is estimated that as many as 80 million people in the United States have varicose veins, 90 percent of whom are women.
