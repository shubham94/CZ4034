Snowden, now 34 years old, was only 8 when 26,000 Seventh-day Adventists in California answered a lengthy series of questions that would shape his career and perhaps help millions of Americans sort out the often confusing advice on how to postpone disease and prolong life. ''All I knew about the Adventists when I was growing up as their neighbor in California was that they went to church on Saturday,'' remarked Dr. Snowden, now an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. Nearly two decades later, while doing research on diet and cancer for his doctorate here, he realized he had been living next door to an epidemiological gold mine: a unique source of data on American eating, exercise, smoking and other habits that can influence health and longevity. The Adventist church proscribes the use of tobacco and alcohol, urges members to follow a vegetarian diet that includes dairy products and eggs, and encourages them to refrain from drinking coffee and other caffeinated beverages. Many Adventists adhere fully to these proscriptions, the rest partly or not at all. For example, half of Adventists are vegetarians who consume no meat, poultry or fish. About 70 percent of Adventists drink no coffee, as against 10 percent of of non-Adventists.", "snippet": "DAVID A.
