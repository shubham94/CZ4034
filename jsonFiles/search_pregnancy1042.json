When BabyCenter.com, a San Francisco Web site, surveyed 310,000 parents and ranked the most popular baby names for 2004, it found that a surprising entry was moving up the national charts. Brooklyn, along with variant spellings like Brooklynn and Brooke Lynn, reached No. 84 on the site's list of girls' names. That's hardly surprising. Brooklyn has been crawling up the charts for 15 years, Social Security Administration numbers show. Ranked just 972nd in 1990, Brooklyn has clambered higher each year. In 2004, 3,211 American baby girls were named Brooklyn. (Why a borough long associated with tough guys ended up primarily as a girl's name is not clear.) Even stars are taking note. With the name's new popularity being spotlighted in the news media, and with a national tour planned for ''Brooklyn the Musical,'' whose heroine's name is just what you'd expect, it's a fair bet that this year even more parents will embrace the name Brooklyn as their own.", "headline": {"main": "Brooklyn Babes", "kicker": "THE NEW BROOKLYNS/THE FUTURE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "11", "word_count": 830, "_id": "4fd25c7d8eb7c8105d80a04d", "snippet": "Some baby somewhere may be named Manhattan, but another borough has captured parents' fancy.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/nyregion/thecity/19name.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "imagepages/2005/06/19/nyregion/19nameCA02ready.html", "rank": "2", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupHeight2": "325", "MultimediaUrl2": "imagepages/2005/06/19/nyregion/19nameCA02ready.html", "MultimediaPopupWidth2": "250", "MultimediaType2": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "imagepages/2005/06/19/nyregion/19nameCA01ready.html", "rank": "1", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupWidth1": "250", "MultimediaUrl1": "imagepages/2005/06/19/nyregion/19nameCA01ready.html", "MultimediaPopupHeight1": "325", "MultimediaType1": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "imagepages/2005/06/19/nyregion/19nameCA03ready.html", "rank": "3", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupHeight3": "325", "MultimediaPopupWidth3": "250", "MultimediaUrl3": "imagepages/2005/06/19/nyregion/19nameCA03ready.html", "MultimediaType3": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "images/2005/06/19/nyregion/19names.752.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/06/19/nyregion/19names.752.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "BROOKLYN (NYC)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "John", "middlename": "Freeman", "lastname": "GILL", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By JOHN FREEMAN GILL"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-06-19T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "New York and Region"}], "meta": {"hits": 3, "offset": 0, "time": 23}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
