But the bigger part was that Group O Direct, though it had been around since 1974, did not know how to navigate corporate shoals. Then, in 2001, SBC Communications, seeking more minority vendors, took Group O Direct, in Milan, Ill., under its wing. ''They led us through their procurement process, what certifications we needed, how to write a bid, who to contact, how to set prices,'' Mr. De La Cruz said. SBC then gave Group O Direct a small contract. A few years later, the Microsoft Corporation helped Group O Direct further ''enhance and refine our business processes,'' as Mr. De La Cruz put it, then gave the company a contract, too.
