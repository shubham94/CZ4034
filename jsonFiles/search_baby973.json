People who abuse drugs and alcohol will have to seek treatment to qualify and people who have entered the United States illegally will not be eligible. The state will also begin an employment program to help welfare recipients upgrade their skills and find work. The guidelines went into effect July 1. Since 1988 the number of people receiving general assistance in Connecticut increased to 34,000 from 11,000. The program, one of several components of the welfare system in Connecticut, provides monthly grants of $314 for people who are able but cannot find work and $356 for those who are unemployable because of medical problems. Audrey Rowe, the Commissioner of the Income Maintenance Department, and a member of a state welfare reform task force formed last year, said that proposals to reform the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program would be examined in the upcoming legislative session.", "headline": {"main": "Helping Welfare Recipients Help Themselves", "kicker": "CONNECTICUT Q&A: AUDREY ROWE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 1751, "_id": "4fd1a1148eb7c8105d6b675b", "snippet": "THE recent legislative overhaul of Connecticut's General Assistance Welfare Program, which is administered by the Department of Income Maintenance through cities and towns, has set stricter guidelines for eligibility and placed limits on the amount...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/19/nyregion/connecticut-q-a-audrey-rowe-helping-welfare-recipients-help-themselves.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ROWE, AUDREY"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "CONNECTICUT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WELFARE (US)"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Andi", "lastname": "RIERDEN"}], "original": "By ANDI RIERDEN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1992-07-19T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "New York and Region"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Home Desk", "lead_paragraph": "SEARCHING for the nation's spirit?
