Kaiser Family Foundation, a national health care philanthropy. PROBLEMS The Uninsured: 37 Million Millions of Americans become uninsured each year, most of them because they do not get insurance on the job and cannot afford to buy it. In 1992, 37 million Americans -- 15 percent of the non-elderly population -- were uninsured on any given day. Because the elderly have Medicare coverage and the very poor and disabled generally have Medicaid, the overwhelming majority of the uninsured (84 percent) are full- or part-time workers and their families. The high cost of insurance limits coverage. Seven in 10 uninsured Americans make less than $30,000 a year. Although the uninsured do get care, they get less, get it later and end up sicker than people with insurance. The Vulnerable While most Americans have insurance, changing jobs can often mean losing coverage: two-thirds of companies with fewer than 25 employees do not offer coverage. In the course of a year, one in five Americans -- more than 50 million people -- will be uninsured at least temporarily and one-third will be without insurance for at least a year. Only 7 percent of uninsured adults say they are uninsured by choice. Six in 10 say they cannot afford coverage and 22 percent cite loss of a job or lack of on-the-job insurance. Three percent can't get coverage because of health problems. The Cost of Care The U.S. is the only major industrial nation that does not provide universal health coverage, yet it spends far more than any other country on health -- more than $800 billion a year, 14 percent of the gross domestic product. And the portion is growing: without cost-containment measures, it is expected to top 18 percent by the year 2000. From 1988 to 1993, the average family premium for employer-based group health insurance doubled, from $2,500 to $5,200. Families wanting to buy health insurance directly from an insurer can spend as much as $10,000 a year. CHOICES Single-Payer The single-payer plan would create a universal public system of health insurance coverage with comprehensive benefits financed by income and payroll taxes instead of premiums. All Americans would be covered, in much the same way the elderly are now covered by Medicare. Employerbased coverage, private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid would be replaced by a single plan. Costs would be controlled through administrative simplification and by a national budget with Government-regulated payment rates for doctors and hospitals. (Example: McDermott-/Wellstone bill.) Employer Mandate Employer-based approaches build on the already extensive system that provides private insurance to two-thirds of the non-elderly population. To achieve universal coverage, all employers would have to offer insurance to employees and help pay the premiums. The Government would provide coverage or help pay for private insurance for nonworkers; Medicare would be kept for the elderly. To contain costs, some plans would regulate prices and set spending limits; others would expand use of managed care, and promote increased competition among health insurance plans. Some plans call for regional alliances, which would spool the purchasing power of small business and promote price competition among plans. (Examples: Clinton plan, House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee bill.) Individual Mandate This approach places the responsibility for obtaining coverage on individuals and families, rather than employers or the Government. To achieve universal coverage, people would be required to obtain insurance either through their employers or by buying it on the private market. The Government would subsidize premium costs for low-income individuals and families. Employers could cover some of the premium costs, but would not be required to. Costs would be controlled by promoting increased consumer consciousness, greater use of managed care and greater competition among health plans. (Examples: Thomas-Chafee bill, Stearns-Nickles bill). No Mandate Voluntary plans build on the existing system by providing incentives to expand coverage and control costs, but do not mandate coverage. Expanded coverage would be encouraged through reforms in the private health insurance market (Like eliminating ineligibility for those with pre-existing conditions), subsidies for low-income people and alliances to help small companies and individuals buy insurance. This approach would control costs and make coverage more affordable by increasing competition among proivate insurance plans and cost consciousness among consumers. (Examples: Cooper-Breaux bill, Michel-Lott bill.) ASSESSING THE PLANS Single-Payer All Americans would have comprehensive health benefits through a single system, regardless of income or employment. This approach would reduce much of the complexity of the present system, but it would shift most of the financing from employers and the private sector to the tax system. It would virtually eliminate a role for private insurance and would concentrate control of the health care system under the Federal Government. It would greatly expand the role of the Government in health, but also provide Government with greater purchasing power to control costs. Employer Mandate Employer-based approaches expand insurance coverage with the least disruption to current arrangements and would minimize change for most Americans. They rely on employers to cover workers and on the Government to provide coverage for nonworkers. Employers and their employees, rather than the Government, pay most of the cost for insuring all workers and their families. Employer mandates would mean higher health insurance costs for some businesses, especially small companies that do not offer insurance today. Government assistance to businesses could help avoid wage cuts, job losses and other potential effects. The mobility of the work force makes this approach administratively complex and requires explicit mechanisms to assure continuous coverage. Cost control based on greater use of managed care and competition among health plans would require much restructuring of the market, without assured effectiveness. Individual Mandate Making individuals responsible for insurance would break the link between employment and insurance coverage -- easing the mobility of the labor force, but also potentially removing business as a source of financing and a force in controlling costs. Government subsidies could be directed to low-wage workers and low-income families rather than more broadly applied to businesses, but the loss of employer contributions would mean substantial tax increases for Federal subsidies to make insurance affordable, without adequate subsidies, coverage could remain beyond the reach of many Americans. An individual-based program would substantially alter current insurance arrangements, and would be complicated to administer and hard to enforce. Increasing consumer awareness could help restain costs, but unless they join alliances, consumers would lack the purchasing power that big employers have now. No Mandate Voluntary approaches provide incentives for cost control and for reaching the uninsured and the vulnerable, but no assurances that these problems will be fully addressed. Market reforms and expanded coverage for low-income people would reduce the number of uninsured but not assure universal coverage. Expanded coverage of low-income people would require additional Federal revenue. Cost containment would depend largely on the success of free-market competition in restraining premium increases.", "headline": {"main": "Navigating the Health Swamp: A Primer"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 1174, "_id": "4fd1dbf58eb7c8105d71cc3b", "snippet": "Nearly everyone agrees that the U.S. health care system needs fixing.
