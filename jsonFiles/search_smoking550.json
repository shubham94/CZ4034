A large and thought-provoking study has found that an inexpensive blood test for a substance called C-reactive protein is better than the standard blood test for cholesterol at predicting a person's risk for heart attack or stroke. People who are overweight or have other cardiovascular risk factors but have lulled themselves into complacency because their cholesterol levels are low would be wise to seek this additional test of their susceptibility. The study, reported last week in The New England Journal of Medicine, provides support for an emerging view that chronic inflammation of the artery walls may play a crucial role in heart attacks and strokes. The traditional focus has been on cholesterol's role in causing fatty deposits on artery walls that gradually thicken until they clog the bloodstream. Now scientists are coming to believe that inflammation is a key factor as well because it weakens the fatty buildups, making them more likely to rupture and cause clotting that can trigger a heart attack or stroke.", "snippet": "Revolutionary advances are being made in the ability to predict which people might succumb to cardiovascular disease.
