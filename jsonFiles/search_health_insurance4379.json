The admission is disturbing. The Budget Office's estimates of savings from health care reform, through no fault of its own, are guesswork. Yet Mr. Clinton says he is using such guesswork to shape a reform for a generation. The Budget Office is required to estimate whether proposed budgets satisfy deficit-reduction targets set out in the 1993 budget law. That is never an easy task. When Congress legislates ordinary tax and spending changes -- such as last year's small gasoline tax -- the Budget Office can generate reliable estimates. But when the issue is huge institutional reform, estimating procedures are not reliable. Expenditures from today's health care system provide no useful guide to expenditures under a completely different system.", "headline": {"main": "Going on Guesswork"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": 277, "_id": "4fd1bf9a8eb7c8105d6ed7a9", "snippet": "President Clinton admitted to the nation's governors this week that he had included insurance premium caps in his health care plan -- a provision many governors oppose -- partly because the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the caps would...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/03/opinion/going-on-guesswork.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REFORM AND REORGANIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEALTH INSURANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1994-02-03T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Saying New York City faced \"a fiscal emergency,\" Mayor Rudolph W.
