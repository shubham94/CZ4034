Prematurely menopausal women are giving birth. Embryos are being frozen to be thawed later and inserted into the womb. Mixtures of sperm and egg cells are being injected into the female reproductive system to undergo fertilization there. Sperm have been extracted surgically from a man's genitalia to fertilize an egg cell from his wife, leading to a normal pregnancy. Such new approaches to infertility, as well as some still in an early experimental stage, such as mechanical insertion of male sperm into the female ovum, or egg cell, are offering new hope to couples unable to conceive children in the normal manner. According to Prof. Alan H. DeCherney of Yale University, which is beginning an embryo-freezing project, one in five couples is infertile, with the cause divided evenly between partners. In recent weeks a number of approaches have been described by specialists in fertility research, including Dr. Alan Trounson of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, where several of the procedures have been developed.", "headline": {"main": "INFERTILITY: A GROWING ARRAY OF REMEDIES"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1933, "_id": "4fd156578eb7c8105d63ac57", "snippet": "THE technique that eight years ago produced the world's first ''test-tube'' baby is being modified and elaborated in ways undreamed of a few years ago.
