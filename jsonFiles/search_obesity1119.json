But last week two prominent medical authorities -- former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and the Institute of Medicine, a unit of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences -- issued timely recommendations that make a start toward pulling in the expanding national paunch. Health authorities were shocked by a huge increase in obesity over the last decade or so -- from 25 percent of the public in a 1976-80 survey to 33 percent in 1988-91. The reasons for the gain -- obesity means 20 percent or more above desirable weight -- are not understood. Despite the recent discovery of an obesity gene and the well-recognized fact that genes play a role in predisposing people to obesity, there has been no major change in the national gene pool over the short span of a decade.", "snippet": "Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. and nobody knows quite what to do about it.
