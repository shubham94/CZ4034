The word most often heard in conversations with elder-care professionals these days is ''crisis.'' With a population calculated to be aging at a rate 20 years ahead of the nation as a whole, the Sunshine State has become a harbinger for a nation growing old and facing problems with long-term care for the aged. As the average life span lengthens, people seem healthier in old age than ever before. The question is how to serve those who become infirm or ill. In Florida and in the nation, most of that burden falls, as it always has, on families, usually on a woman caring for an older one. In Florida, a study four years ago found that almost 80 percent of the frail elderly were cared for at home. African-American and Hispanic families are more likely to care for their own, says Larry Polivka, director of the Center on Aging at the University of South Florida, whereas more whites seek professional help. But there is no way to know what quality of care the people at home actually get, or what sacrifices their care-givers have to make to give it.", "headline": {"main": "Editorial Observer; The Crisis in Providing Care for the Elderly Ill"}, "abstract": "Dudley Clendinen, in Editorial Observer column, holds that in Florida, where 25 percent of state's population is expected to be over 65 by year 2010, there is 'crisis' in providing long-term care for aged (M)c", "print_page": "18", "word_count": 791, "_id": "4fd21a648eb7c8105d798a83", "snippet": "In Florida, where retirees have been flocking since the 1920's and where 25 percent of the state's population is expected to be over 65 by the year 2010, there are growing feelings of strain and exhaustion among the managers, the nurses and nurses'...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/02/opinion/editorial-observer-the-crisis-in-providing-care-for-the-elderly-ill.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "FLORIDA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEALTH INSURANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AGED"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Dudley", "lastname": "CLENDINEN"}], "original": "By DUDLEY CLENDINEN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2000-09-02T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Senator Joseph I.
