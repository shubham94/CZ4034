A provocative simple claim, but is it true? Suddenly, the placebo effect has made a comeback after having been supposedly debunked last year by a group of Danish researchers. In a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Asbjorn Hrobjartsson reported that placebos were no more effective than doing nothing in a variety of medical illnesses like hypertension, asthma and obesity. As a result, many researchers pronounced the placebo effect a myth.
