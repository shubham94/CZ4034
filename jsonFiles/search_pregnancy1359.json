In his routine as a divorced father, this seemed normal to Juan Miguel. From the time when he and Elizabet had separated two years earlier, on the most amicable terms, the boy had lived with his father and spent every other day at his mother's house. But Elizabet's door was padlocked over the weekend and on Monday as well, and Juan Miguel began to make inquiries. This was how he learned the bad news that was already becoming common knowledge in the city of Cardenas: Elian's mother had left with him for Miami, with 12 other people, in an aluminum boat 5 1/2 meters long, with no life preservers and a decrepit motor. It was Nov. 22, 1999. ''My life ended that day,'' Juan Miguel said four months later. After their divorce, he and Elizabet had maintained a relationship that was cordial but rather unusual: they continued living under the same roof and sharing their dreams in the same bed, hoping to produce as lovers the child they had not been able to have as a married couple. It seemed impossible. Elizabet would conceive but miscarry in the first four months of pregnancy. After seven miscarriages, the child they had longed for was born.
