Congress has to agree by next fall on how to replace the expiring 1990 farm rules. For the new Republican majority, it will be a stark test of how deeply it really believes that the Federal Government does more harm than good by interfering with market forces. In the end, the battle is bound to illustrate just how tough it will be for Republicans to deliver on their promise to trim the role of Government in the average citizen's life. Bewildering Barriers Current farm policy looks at first glance to be an easy target for radical reformers. No one is denying it is made up of a hodgepodge of sometimes conflicting programs, many of them dating from the Great Depression of the 1930's, when both farming and rural life in general were vastly different. Most of the billions of dollars spent these days on subsidies goes to big corporations or farmers who are wealthier than the average taxpayer. Farm programs are intended to boost incomes for producers of dairy products and crops through a bewildering array of barriers to the free flow of goods and prices. There are import quotas protecting the dairy industry and crops like sugar and peanuts. The Agriculture Department sets price floors for the dairy industry by region. And it enforces marketing programs, developed by the growers themselves, of more than 40 different fruits and crops. The Government also provides bargain loans and subsidized insurance. And, in a program subject to unpredictable multi-billion dollar swings in cost to taxpayers, Washington makes direct payments to corn, wheat, rice and cotton growers when market prices for those crops fall below Federally designated targets. Critics say those policies contribute to ills ranging from the loss of Indonesian rain forests to the decline of the small American family farm. Farmers for their part have deep misgivings about whether the benefits they get are worth all the restrictions they must also accept on how they farm. A recent survey by the University of Illinois and Purdue University of 10,000 farmers found that 37 percent wanted the entire system scrapped, almost as many as the 41 percent who supported it. For all its faults, though, American farm policy has a long track record of winning bipartisan support, and some who have followed it over the years wonder why there is so much griping. Americans spend about 12 percent of their disposable income on food, among the lowest percentage in the world. The nation's farmers set new production records this year in corn, soybeans, cotton and rice and, with cooperative weather, clearly have the tools to break those records for these and other crops in years to come. Farm goods make up one of the brightest spots in the trade picture -- American farmers are the world's most productive -- and with exports invariably top imports by a wide margin. Moreover, farm incomes have been rising in recent years and farm debt has fallen. To be sure, small farms continue to disappear by the thousands, but the rate is down sharply from 30 years ago. Soil is being more carefully preserved. And the newer pesticides are more benign environmentally and used more carefully. \"I think the programs are working reasonably well,\" said Dan Glickman, a Kansas Democrat who lost his seat last month and now is said to be the leading candidate to replace Mike Espy as Agriculture Secretary in January. The trend in recent times has been to renew the concept of Federal income support for farmers every fifth year, but each time at a lower level and with new environmental, production and accounting strings attached. Payments have already fallen to less than half the record $25.8 billion in direct assistance farmers received in 1986 as the result of reforms in farm legislation passed in 1985 and 1990. This year's bumper crops drove prices down to levels that are expected to send the payments soaring by several billion dollars next year, creating new fodder for critics who see the programs as budget dynamite. But Republicans who will lead the debate for their party are already warning off those inclined to push for sweeping reform. \"There's something to be said for stability,\" said Pat Roberts, the Kansas Republican who will head the House Agriculture Committee. Mr. Roberts' constituents include wheat farmers who have been among the biggest beneficiaries of subsidies. The problem for those who would settle for tinkering with the existing structure to save money -- say, by decreasing the percentage of land on which a farmer can get support payments or lowering the price targets at which the subsidies kick in -- is that many farmers may simply drop out. That would make a shambles of related \"voluntary\" programs like those requiring farmers to accept soil conservation rules in order to remain eligible for subsidies. 'Close to the Bottom' \"We are pretty close to the bottom of the barrel on what you can cut and still get voluntary compliance in other areas,\" said Abner Womack, an agricultural economist at the University of Missouri who has studied various possible packages of farm policy for the Food and Agricultural Policy Institute, a research organization sponsored by six universities. With the trend toward a slimmed-down Agriculture Department already under way, most notably in plans announced last week to shut down hundreds of field offices, the department looks more dependent than ever on farmers' willingness to observe both the letter and spirit of regulations. Congress may get a shock when it adds up the cost of replacing the most popular pieces of the current policies. If the Government does not subsidize exports, American farmers will be playing on an uneven field in world markets and lose market share to subsidized foreign producers. If it does not pay to protect rural environments -- through incentives to farmers or bigger budgets for enforcers -- environmental problems will mount. And if Congress does not want to risk much more volatility in food prices, the Government will have to play a role in supply management. Indeed, when it comes to getting the Government out of agriculture, it looks like you cannot get there from here.", "headline": {"main": "The Nation; Hardy Perenials In U.S. Farm Policy"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "16", "word_count": 1046, "_id": "4fd1b8378eb7c8105d6dfa0f", "snippet": "POLICY buffs who enjoyed this year's impassioned debate over health care will love the battles next year over farm policy.
