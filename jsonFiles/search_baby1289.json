By Robin Marantz Henig One thousand grams is about the weight of three good-sized grapefruits, a typical Sunday newspaper or two dense loaves of bread. And it's about the weight of the human being that was presented to Roni Handler last Halloween as her first baby, a boy. ''The doctors and nurses didn't think the baby would come out in one piece,'' says Mrs. Handler, 25, who went into labor in the 26th week of her first pregnancy - more than three months before her due date. ''He was breech (upside down in the womb) and his foot was stuck, and they didn't expect him to weigh even one pound. But he came out pink, breathing and weighing 2 pounds 1 ounce. And it was a boy. All I had wanted was a boy. We were ecstatic.''", "headline": {"main": "THE CHILD SAVERS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "35", "word_count": 4365, "_id": "4fd110438eb7c8105d5c5754", "snippet": "Robin Marantz Henig is a science writer.
