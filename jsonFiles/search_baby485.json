Three bright-eyed women come to the big city to become stars in this tribute to vaudeville starring Mia Barron, Maggie Lacey and Danielle Skraastad (1:30). Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. 'HECUBA' Preview today. Opens tomorrow. The ferocious Tony-winning actress Vanessa Redgrave roars as the former Queen of Troy in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Euripides' tragedy (1:45). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, (718)636-4100. 'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' Opens Sunday. Don't touch Harry K. Thaw's wife. Stanford White learned that the hard way, and this play with music documents how the architect was murdered and the subsequent media circus (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444. 'BIRDIE BLUE' Opens Thursday. S. Epatha Merkerson stars as the title character in this memory play about a woman whose life changed tragically on the day that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. 'SWIMMING IN THE SHALLOWS' Previews start Tuesday. Opens June 28. Edward Albee covered man-goat love. Now Adam Bock looks into man-shark romance in his new nonrealistic comedy about young urban types (1:30). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212)246-4422. 'TWELFTH NIGHT' Previews start today. Opens June 25. The Aquila Theater presents Shakespeare's comedy about mistaken identities, unrequited love and the threats of a puritanical zealot (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200. Broadway 'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy, Elaine May, mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' (Tony Award, Best Musical Revival 2005) Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising souffl\u00e9 of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood) 'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley) 'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars, Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'MARK TWAIN TONIGHT!' In a role he has been playing over half a century, Hal Holbrook delivers a performance that is perhaps most remarkable for the energy it derives from a studied languor. Mr. Holbrook's Twain is an exhilarating master of theatrical passive aggression, while Twain's observations about corrupt journalists, politicians and religious fanatics remain soberingly relevant (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street (212)307-4100.(Brantley) * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley) 'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'FASTER' Two sides of a love triangle snap under the pressure of our speeded-up culture in ''Faster'' by London's Filter Theater, part of the Brits Off Broadway festival. Based on James Gleick's book of the same name, the play is elegiac but also an exuberant demonstration of the electrifying acceleration of modern life (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.(Miriam Horn) * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger) 'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30) . Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson) * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Isherwood) 'RAIN' Wild, witty, wet and altogether winning. Those words sum up Rain, the new Cirque \u00c9loize show that is ending the season at the New Victory Theater with a figurative and literal splash. This Quebec-based troupe, which opened the New Victory in December 1995, combines high circus arts and ingratiating self-mockery with nostalgic costumes, eclectic music and song, evocative lighting and creative choreography in two hours of fun calculated to please children and adults alike (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'SENECA'S OEDIPUS' In the new production of Seneca's ''Oedipus'' by the Theater by the Blind, the iconic story of the king of Thebes who unknowingly murders his father and marries his mother is performed in modern dress. The poet Ted Hughes's masterly 1968 adaptation is vividly alive, contemporary and shocking (1:30). Mint Space, 311 West 43rd Street, (212)868-4444. (Honor Moore) 'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs. Goldsmith's 1773 comedy mocks the snobbery of the London upper class, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Genzlinger) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder) 'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Presnyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley) * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates) Off Off Broadway 'DISCONNECT' Plant four witty, intellectually stimulating people around a dinner table and you might have an engaging play. Plant four uninsightful, insipid people around a dinner table and you have ''Disconnect,'' a new work by Rob Ackerman that lets some self-absorbed 30-somethings whine for two hours about lost friends and parental beatings of long ago (1:45). The Working Theater, at the East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Genzlinger) * 'DISPOSABLE MEN' James Scruggs, who wrote and performed this collection of character pieces, engages issues of race in the button-pushing satirical style that Spike Lee was aiming for (yet failed to pull off) in his film Bamboozled. This multimedia show compares the way African-American men are portrayed in the media to images of monsters in classic horror films like Frankenstein and King Kong (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, one block below Spring Street, (212)868-4444.(Jason Zinoman) 'FLAT' This happily crass send-up of a BBC family drama is perfectly pitched for fans nostalgic for the self-parodying vulgarity of the sit-com ''Married With Children.'' Twelve episodes, quick scenes, stock characters and an opening montage sequence with a jingle that will lodge itself in your cranium, like it or not (1:00). Part of the Moral Values Festival. Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)868-4444. (Zinoman) 'KICKER' What happens when a star journalist mistakes a seven-hour interview with a celebrity novelist for the beginning of a beautiful friendship? This premise is better than this would-be comedy, which doesn't manage to make its characters or situations credible enough to answer its own question. Best: the send-up of the Hollywood star spewing out the same old quotes -- and, true to the title, the last line. Connelly Theater, 220 East 4th Street, (212)868-4444. (Anne Midgette) 'LITTLE MARY' William S. Leavengood's parable about faith, politics and conservatism in the Roman Catholic Church can sound more like a position paper than a play, but the author's strong storytelling instincts can't be denied (2:10). Sanford Meisner Theater, 164 11th Avenue, at 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)352-3101.(Andrea Stevens) 'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101. (Brantley) 'TRAILERVILLE' Here in the age of baby-boomer angst about unwell parents, stages and bookshelves and movie-of-the-week schedules are full of old people and those who care for them, which means that the those who would visit the subject today need to make sure they're bringing some fresh insights. John Dufresne, a novelist trying full-length drama, doesn't in ''Trailerville,'' an unruly play with a respectable supply of nicely turned phrases but nothing new to add to the growing eldercare genre (2:15). Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, (212)868-4444, (Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley) 'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley) 'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Gates) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley) Last Chance 'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby; she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'MARATHON 2005, SERIES B' The second installment in this annual festival of short plays, which includes lively sketches by David Mamet and David Lindsay-Abaire, allows theatergoers the pleasure of hearing famous voices practicing scales, as it were, and of discovering that no matter what key they're singing in, they still sound like themselves (1:45). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101, closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet, Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'RICHARD AND ANNE' That idiot Shakespeare had it all wrong, according to ''Richard and Anne,'' an unknown script by Maxwell Anderson that is being energetically brought to light by the young actors of Mirror Repertory's training program. Tired of being maligned in productions of ''Richard III,'' the real Richard, no hunched back evident, comes back from the grave to set things straight (2:15). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, Manhattan, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. ( Midgette) 'WORK: A MADCAP TRAGI-PARODY OF CORPORATE AMERICA' Unless you've been living in a cave, Charlotte Meehan's play ''Work: A Madcap Tragi-Parody of Corporate America'' should sound familiar, starting with its title. But when real life tops fiction, what's left to say? Not much, in this case. And that's the problem (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)226-2407, closing on Thursday. (Stevens) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D' (PG, 94 minutes) There's a reason that children aren't allowed to vote, drive, or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape their dreamworlds into coherent and compelling stories -- a task the director Robert Rodriguez (''El Mariachi,'' ''Sin City'') also fails to accomplish in this muddled quest narrative based on characters and themes created by his 7-year-old son, Racer Max.(Dana Stevens) * 'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis) 'THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY' (PG, 120 minutes) The best efforts of the blue-ribbon cast cannot save this hopelessly stuffy, muddled screen adaptation of Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel set in Peru in the early 18th century. (Stephen Holden) * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured, and entertaining.(Holden) 'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best part of Ron Howard's ingratiating, Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, two actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger also stars. (Dargis) 'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism.(A.O. Scott) * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott) '5x2' (R, 90 minutes, in French) A couple's relationship unravels backward, from divorce through the birth of their child to their first meeting. Interesting but chilly. (Scott) * 'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott) 'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott) * 'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott) 'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott) * 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis) 'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden) 'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis) 'THE LONGEST YARD' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In this crummy remake of the 1974 film of the same title, Adam Sandler stars as the former N.F.L. quarterback Paul Crewe, who years earlier was booted out of the league for shaving points and is now charged with leading a team of prisoners against a team of guards. In the original film, directed with seriocomic facility by Robert Aldrich, Crewe was played by Burt Reynolds with effortless charm and the tightest pants this side of Tony Orlando. The Aldrich version was recently released on DVD and makes for a nice evening in. (Dargis) 'LORDS OF DOGTOWN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Southern California skateboarders in the 1970's, when a hobby became a full-blown (and lucrative) subculture. Scruffy, loose and reckless, in the spirit of its time and place. (Scott) 'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo -- expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott) 'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott) 'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis) 'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden) * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott) 'THE NINTH DAY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in German) A somber, thought-provoking moral thriller, in which a Roman Catholic priest from Luxembourg, temporarily released from Dachau, finds his conscience tested when the Nazis try to co-opt him. Interesting ideas, insufficiently dramatized. (Scott) 'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Stevens) * 'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott) 'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Youngsters will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful for this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity.(Ned Martel) Film Series JAMES DEAN (Through Thursday) Film Forum's two-week festival, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Dean's death, continues with his second film, Nicholas Ray's sympathetic juvenile delinquent drama ''Rebel Without a Cause'' (1955), tonight through Tuesday.

BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718) 777-FILM or (718)636-4100, $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. BAD PLUS (Tonight) This piano-driven power trio's adventurous spirit straddles the boundaries of jazz and rock, and their exuberant forays are way more fun than their sketchy decision to cover Nirvana's ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' would suggest. The players, native Midwesterners all, throw themselves into live shows with prairie-fire earnestness. 7:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street & Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, free. (Laura Sinagra) BETTIE SERVEERT (Tomorrow) In the mid-90's, these Dutch bohemians' combination of bright, twisty guitar work and the breathy yet plucky voice of Carol Van Dyk became a college-rock mainstay. They remain resolutely quirky, continuing to deliver honest grownup pop dispatches. 8:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $15, $17 at the door. (Sinagra) BILAL (Thursday) Bilal has huge ambitions, spanning jazz and soul, funk and gospel, hip-hop and pop. Even when his material doesn't live up to those ambitions, he has musicality to spare. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston, South Village, (212)243-4940, $22, $25 at the door.(Jon Pareles) BOYZ II MEN (Tuesday) The smooth, if extravagantly produced, harmonies of this R&B quartet made the breakup anthem ''End of the Road'' and their duet with Mariah Carey, the epic after-death apology ''One Sweet Day'' blockbuster radio singles in the mid-90's. Recently, they have been sticking to greatest hits and cover projects. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305, $39 to $49. (Sinagra) BRAVE COMBO (Thursday) Can every rock and pop style be reduced -- or elevated -- to the fast bounce of a polka? Brave Combo has been making polka hybrids since 1979. 10 p.m. Satalla, 37 West 26th Street (212)576-1155, $15, $18 at the door. (Pareles) JOHN BUTLER TRIO, WOOD BROTHERS (Tuesday) John Butler is an Australian guitarist who, like Ben Harper, turns thoughtful songs into guitar and slide-guitar excursions. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $16, $18 at the door (sold out). (Pareles) LAURA CANTRELL (Tuesday) With her old-timey country radio show on WFMU and real Southern roots, the guitarist and songwriter Laura Cantrell has a deep alt-country r\u00e9sum. She writes clever ditties about the urban romantic experience. 7 p.m., Virgin Megastore, Union Square, 52 East 14th Street, (212)598-4666, free. (Sinagra) VANESSA CARLTON (Tuesday) The Wayans brothers' ''White Chicks'' poked fun at the pianist and songwriter Vanessa Carlton's daintily petulant 2002 hit ''A Thousand Miles,'' while acknowledging that it's a truly infectious sinagalong. Her recent efforts reveal charming lyrics, though the her piano playing is still rather fussy. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $20. (Sinagra) * DERRICK CARTER (Sunday) Count on Mr. Carter to spin an exciting, unpredictable set. He loves to enliven his thwacking house beats with squiggles and squelches, and he gravitates toward robotic bass lines, disembodied voices and scrambled snippets of disco and jazz. With Miss Honey Dijon. 10 p.m., Cielo, 18 Little West 12th Street, near Greenwich Street, the Meatpacking District, (212)645-5700, $15. (Kelefa Sanneh) CJ CHENIER (Sunday) This son of Clifton Chenier, who was the undisputed king of zydeco, picked up his father's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band in the 1980's, carrying on the family tradition of bayou dance music laced with blues. 6:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, (212)576-1155, $22. (Pareles) THE COMAS (Tomorrow) Like a lot of indie rock bands, the Comas seem tentative about ''really trying.'' But when they do, as on the best cuts from last year's dreamy ''Conductor'' (Yep Roc), their portrayals of wage slavery and lolling slacker lust exude an intriguing passive-aggression. 10 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, rothkonyc.com, $10. (Sinagra) COMETS ON FIRE (Thursday) As epic as the Grateful Dead in its late 60's ballroom era and as noisy as its distant forebears Sonic Youth, this band conjures dark granduer with guitars and organ creating a swirl of heedless squall. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $14, $16 at the door. (Sinagra) ELYSIAN FIELDS (Tomorrow) With Jennifer Charles's smoky voice and Oren Bloedow's electric guitar, Elysian Fields conjure a haunted, late-night atmosphere in songs full of love and trouble. 9:30 p.m. Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200, $15. (Pareles) FREE BLOOD (Tomorrow) This trio, a side-project of the dance-punk band called !!!, is the headliner at this concert devoted to discordant (and sometimes danceable) post-punk. The charming venue (long may it last) sells sweet confections, used records and beer, in three rooms on two levels. 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212)253-0036, $6.(Sanneh) ROBERT FRIPP (Thursday) The King Crimson guitarist and master of the spacey, droning combination of tape loops called ''Frippertronics'' performs selections from his ongoing ''Soundscapes'' project in this newly renovated space. 8 p.m., Concert Hall at the Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, 212874-5210 and 212712-7171, $37.50. (Sinagra) DAVID GRUBBS (Tonight) The good parts of progressive rock -- its willingness to embrace complexity and eccentricity, its determination to avoid formulas -- have meant a lot to David Grubbs. He has been central to Gastr del Sol and Bastro, two bands known for heartfelt, wayward songs and excursions to the edges of rock. 8 p.m., the Project Room, 400 Carroll Street, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, $10. (Pareles) LALAH HATHAWAY (Thursday) The daughter of the songwriter Donny Hathaway made a loving rhythm-and-blues album in 1990 and has since turned up as a jazz singer. This is a chance to hear what she's been up to lately. She plays this outdoor concert as part of BAM's R&B Festival. 12 p.m., MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, downtown Brooklyn, free. (Pareles) MICHAEL HURLEY, THE PLACES (Sunday) Mr. Hurley is one of the most fertile-minded of all the unreconstructed folkies. Though he's had his ups and downs, the humor and grooves of his detailed, offhandedly existential songs about talking porkchops and growing pot deserve a place in the American songbook. The Places are led by a Portland Americana artist, Amy Annelle. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503, $10. (Sinagra) IRON & WINE (Tonight) The modern rustic Sam Beam takes a whispery, almost Chet Baker-like approach to folk vocals. Sung atop delicately plucked guitar, his lyrics speak to the sensitive male's concerns about intimacy and mortality. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, $18 , $20 at the door. (Sinagra) JUNIOR SENIOR (Thursday) This Danish duo hit big in 2003 with the euphoric, semi-campy dancefloor dictum ''Move You Feet.'' Its exuberant thumps and shouts rang bells with dance-music and rock fans. Their new single, ''Itch U Can't Scratch,'' slows things down a bit, mixing disco and peppy old-school rap. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Sinagra) JORMA KAUKONEN (Saturday) One of the original psychedelic blues players, Jorma Kaukonen brought the Jefferson Airplane both searing electric guitar lines and old-fashioned blues. He then founded Hot Tuna, a band built on spiky, ragtimey blues. His own songs contemplate death and loss, holding his gentle voice in a lattice of fingerpicking. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd, (212)997-4144, $32.50, $36 at the door. (Pareles) CYNDI LAUPER (Thursday) The new waver and activist Cyndi Lauper retains the zany streak that made her jumpy pro-girl pop songs and emotional synthesizer ballads favorites on MTV in the 1980's. She performs as part of Lincoln Center's Gay Pride salute lineup. Show time is 7 p.m., Rose Theater at the Time Warner Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)721-6500, $85 to $135. (Sinagra) LITTLE RICHARD (Wednesday) Rock 'n' roll wouldn't be the same without the whoops and hollers, the pounding barrelhouse piano chords and swooping glissandos that Little Richard hurled onto his singles in the 1950's. Preaching from the piano stool and belting songs like ''Tutti Frutti,'' he's still a force for creative anarchy. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144, $60 (Pareles) M2O PLAY PIAZZOLA (Tomorrow) Accomplished tango musicians, the violinist Machiko Ozawa and the pianist Makia Matsumura interpret the roiling, fluid music of Astor Piazzolla, 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village , www.thestonenyc.com, $10. (Sinagra) HUGH MASEKELA (Thursday) The South African flugelhornist Hugh Masekela has more to offer than his international hit ''Grazing in the Grass.'' For decades, he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zig-zagging possibilities of jazz. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation. (Pareles) MODEST MOUSE, CAMPER VAN BEETHOVEN (Monday) The Modest Mouse frontman Isaac Brock uses his guitar to evoke creepy, lonely Northwestern expanses, but his rhythmic yen sometimes produces disco hybrids like the recent ''Float On,'' which unfurls bright guitar ribbons over a stomping beat. 80's college rock jokesters Camper van Beethoven recently reunited to release a concept album about a dystopian California. 6 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, 72nd Street, (212)360-2777, $30, $35 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra) THE NATIONAL (Tonight) These Brooklynites play a kind of countryfied glowering rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. But even if the self-deprecating relationship woes of its frontman, Matt Berninger, recall those of the Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo, his renderings have yet to make his gripes as interesting. 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $12 (sold out). (Sinagra) THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS/GREEN MILK (Wednesday and Thursday) This revved-up Vancouver outfit's tight power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension, until the voice of Neko Case cuts through like a triumphant skywriter. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)798-0406, sold out. June 25 at 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation.(Sinagra) NORTHERN STATE, SUPAGROUP, JASON LOWENSTEIN, DJ EUGENE HUTZ (Wednesday) Hipster luminaries coming together in a benefit for a union representing Village Voice employees include Northern State, the female rappers from Long Island whose buoyant and self-aware rhyming tickled funny bones a couple of years ago; the raucously sloppy heavy metal act Supagroup, the energetic former Sebadoh member Mr. Lowenstein; and Gogol Bordello's self-proclaimed Gypsy-punk frontman Eugene Hutz. 8 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, rothkonyc.com, $10. (Sinagra) OASIS, JET (Wednesday) No one ever accused Manchester's football-loving Gallagher brothers of originality or humility, and Oasis, their brash Beatlesque steamroller of a band, stands by their proven formula: simple, epic riffs, melodies arrogant in their inevitability and lyrics so dim they become profound. The one-hit rock 'n' rollers Jet open. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212)465-6741, $34.50 to $75, (sold out). (Sinagra) DON OMAR (Tomorrow) One of reggaeton's biggest names is a headliner at the ''2005 Latin Fest,'' an amusement-park concert where other performers include the salsa singer Victor Manuelle, the rapper Cuban Link and Hector el Bambino, another reggaeton star. 3 p.m., Northern Star Arena, Six Flags Great Adventure, 1090 King George Post Road, New Jersey Turnpike Exit 7A, Jackson, N.J., (732)928-1821, $53. (Sanneh) TOM PETTY & THE HEARTBREAKERS+BLACK CROWES (Tuesday) The rocker Tom Petty's slightly technophobic 2002 ''The Last DJ'' (Warner Brothers) righteously lamented corporate greed and radio blandness. But it contained no especially radio-worthy songs. Nothing like the raw scrape of ''Refugee,'' the rousing ''Free Fallin''' or the darkly hyper ''American Girl.'' 7:30 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, (516)221-1000, $39.50 to $67.50. (Sinagra) TOSHI REAGON (Sunday) Singing about both love and politics with the same sense of independence, Toshi Reagon applies her gutsy voice and syncopated guitar playing to songs steeped in blues and funk. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette, East Village, (212)539-8770, $20. (Pareles) JONATHAN RICHMAN (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) Recent albums haven't added much to this whimsically nuerotic rock 'n' roll livewire's stream-of-consciousness classics, but the live ritual remains a goofy joy. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $15. (Sinagra) KENNY WAYNE SHEPHERD (Tomorrow) For young blues guitarists like Kenny Wayne Shepherd, the blues has as much to do with the Allman Brothers and Jimi Hendrix as it did with Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson. With a baritone howl that's somewhere between Gregg Allman and Robin Trower and a guitar style that looks to Stevie Ray Vaughan, Mr. Shepherd treats the blues as a muscular cry of desperation. 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., Garden State Parkway, Exit 116, (732)335-0400, $20 to $45. (Pareles) SLEATER-KINNEY, DEAD MEADOW (Thursday) The incisive yet expansive guitar soloing lately preferred by Carrie Brownstein is the best reason to check out Sleater-Kinney, the enduring trio of grown-up riot grrrls who reach new melodic heights with each album. Dead Meadow plays heavy and somehow pastoral hard rock. 6:45 p.m. Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, (212)247-0200, $21. (Sinagra) * RICHIE SPICE (Sunday) This fiery roots-reggae singer released one of 2004's best reggae albums, ''Spice in Your Life'' (www.fifthelementrecords.com). He loves midtempo reggae grooves, but he's a restless singer; the album includes ''Earth a Run Red,'' his fiery and exhilarating protest song that makes the apocalypse sound like the world's best (and last) party. With Chuck Fender, Anthony Cruz and Spanna Banna. 10 p.m., Wild Palm, 1601 Bronxdale Avenue, the Bronx, (646)539-0749, $30. (Sanneh) EMILIANA TORRINI (Wednesday) Though she's of Italian and Icelandic descent, Emiliana Torrini was raised in Britain. Her first material was produced in the trip-hop vein, but her latest effort ''Fisherman's Woman'' showcases her haunting voice in a more acoustic setting. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $12.(Sinagra) TRACHTENBURG FAMILY SLIDESHOW PLAYERS (Wednesday and Thursday) In this familial performance art project, Jason Trachtenburg plays lo-fi pop tunes inspired by slides found at yard sales and flea markets, while his wife, Tina, runs the projector. Their 9-year-old daughter, Rachel, who has become something of a girl-power poster child, plays drums. 8 p.m., Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)575-0300, $15. (Sinagra) TRINIDAD & TOBAGO WORLD STEELBAND MUSIC FESTIVAL (Sunday) When Trinidad and Tobago opened their biennial steelband competition to the world in 1988, it drew competitors from Venezuela, Guyana and Sweden. In 2004, bands hailed from Europe, the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The competition, which requires that a classical composition be played, highlights the full range of steel-pan sonics. 4 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street at Seventh Avenue, (212)465-6741, $44.50 to $59.50. (Sinagra) DAR WILLIAMS (Wednesday) This adorable coffeehouse singer-songwriter augments her sweet voice with that rare quality of seeming like a real person. If her acoustic musings about a favorite babysitter or the romance of Spring Street can seem impossibly hopeful, they rarely slip into treacle. 7 p.m., Madison Square Park, Madison Avenue and 26th Street, free. (Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL (Sundays at 2 and 8 p.m.) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan; (212)419-9331. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $42 at 8, plus a $15 minimum; an $80 dinner-and-show package is available. (Stephen Holden) * BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212)265-8133. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available. (Holden) * EARTHA KITT (Tuesdays through Saturdays) The godmother of golddiggers, still glamorous as ever at 78, remains in full command of a voice that can tear into a song with a ravenous ferocity, and the personality to go with it. Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan; (212)744-1600, through July 2.

Thursday through June 25 and June 30 and July 1 and 2 at 8 p.m.; Tuesday, Wednesday and June 26 at 7 p.m.; July 3 at 3 p.m., ArcLight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, between Broadway and Columbus Avenue, Manhattan, (212)868-4444, $18. (Dunning) * URBAN BUSH WOMEN (Tuesday through June 26) This dynamic all-female modern-dance troupe will celebrate its 20th anniversary with the new ''Walking with Pearl: Africa Diaries,'' an evocation of the life and work of Pearl Primus by the company's director, Jawole Willa Jo Zollar; and a new piece by Bridget L.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith) AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizzazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'\u00eatre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith) * EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agust\u00edn Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Holland Cotter) * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith) MET: 'DEFINING YONGLE,' through July 10. This show of imperial art in early-15th-century China is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith) MET: 'MAX ERNST,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.)(Cotter) MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson) * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman) NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck) NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck) STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI, 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman) * STUDIO MUSEUM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith) UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck) WHITNEY AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, the artist's ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson) Galleries: Uptown HUBERTUS GOJOWCZYK: 'THE BOOK AS OBJECT' If Joseph Cornell had been a librarian, he might have produced sculptures like the fantastically altered books that this Polish artist creates. Glass eyes stare out from the pages of one old tome; the corner of another morphs into a waxy brain. Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through June 24. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street DON COLLEY: 'FALL GUYS & ZEITGEISTS' Whether or not you like his images of thuggish clowns and romantic skies, you have to admit that Mr. Colley's new pieces are technically remarkable. They appear to be small, beautifully worked encaustic paintings, but they are, in fact, kiln-fired glazed ceramic tiles. George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212)644-5665, through June. (Johnson) THOMAS SCH\u00dcTTE: 'ONE MAN HOUSES' Models of small, modernistic houses meant to be built full-size by collectors, who buy them and furniture made from hollow-core doors, reflect on design and consumerism but with less formal interest and conceptual wit than do the works of Andrea Zittel or Jorge Pardo. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212)977-7160, through July 2. (Johnson) 'OK/OKAY' This entertaining two-gallery exhibition introduces 14 European artists whose works in nontraditional media tend to read like overproduced one-liners. Swiss Institute , 495 Broadway, (212)925-2035; and Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212)998-6780, through July 16. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea BENJAMIN BUTLER: 'FOREST'S EDGE' Abstracted landscapes made with a brusquely sensuous touch in finely tuned colors toy with conventions of early Modernism to visually exciting effect. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212)279-9219, through June 18. (Johnson) SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN' Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through July 22. (Johnson) CHAN CHAO: 'ECHO' Tension between the clinical and the voyeuristic animates high-definition portraits of attractive nude woman by a photographer known for portraits of young Burmese rebel soldiers. Yancy Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through July 2. (Johnson) * GREGORY CREWDSON: BENEATH THE ROSES Narrative and theatrical craft have overtaken art and visual form in these dreary mural-size color photographs, which are so freighted with props, contrivances and omens, and so monotonously joyless that their sense of foreboding turns into parody. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street (212)206-6100, through June 18. (Smith) JASPER JOHNS: CATENARY Paintings and drawings less mandarin in their personal iconography only by comparison with the clotted art of the 1980's and 90's. There is a series of stupendously beautiful prints. The redeeming through line is touch, whose eloquence nearly salvages the works from their own oppressive claustrophobia. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)243-0200, through June 25. (Kimmelman) 'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three-dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson) HIROSHI SUGIMOTO Photographs of antique mathematical and mechanical models, evoking Brancusi, Arp and Man Ray, turning their subjects into big-screen cinematic presences, curvaceous and potent. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212)627-1018, through June 25. (Kimmelman) TIP TOLAND: 'CYCLE OF LIFE' Comically humane and technically impressive painted clay sculptures by this West Coast ceramicist include a life-size, nude, octogenarian lady in a sexy, standing pose and twin gray-haired women realized with remarkable realism from the waist up. Nancy Margolis, 523 West 25th Street, (212)242-3013, through June 30. (Johnson) KARIN WEINER: 'FRONTIERA' A camp site of cardboard logs, stuffed fabric stones and a rag rug around a television set; suspended stuffed clouds like ornate patchwork mattresses; a mound of stuffed antlers; and collages of countless flowers comprise this industriously zany artist's second solo. ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212)229-1088, through July 29. (Johnson) Other Galleries * MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter) * 'ALBERTO CASADO: TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-0473, through June 25.(Johnson) MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith) 'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass includes teardrops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained-glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson) JUDY LEDGERWOOD: 'SPRING FEVER' With a boldly insouciant touch and vibrantly dissonant colors, this Chicago-based artist makes grid-based pattern paintings using heraldic overtones and punchy mandala compositions of squished balloonlike shapes. Tracy Williams, 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212)229-2757, through June 24. (Johnson) MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, through July 31. (Smith) MALCOM MORLEY: THE ART OF PAINTING After 30 years, Malcolm Morley returns to the Photo Realist painting style he helped found in the mid 1960's, further exploring the tensions between reality, the art of painting and the act of looking and demonstrating that fidelity, taken far enough, turns into something else. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)999-7337, through June 25. (Smith) Last Chance DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the handmade and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)255-8450, closing tomorrow.(Smith) ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)989-7600, closing tomorrow. (Glueck) CORNELIA FOSS Graceful, mature, modest paintings full of light and a subtle geometry: views of the beaches and salt marshes on Long Island and of Central Park. DFN Gallery, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman) * JULIO GONZ\u00c1LEZ This small but illuminating 43-piece exhibition surveys the career of a sculptor who, late in life, taught Picasso how to work with metal and then went on in the 1930's to create playful, Cubist-style, welded iron assemblages that transformed modern sculpture. Instituto Cervantes, 211 East 49th Street, Turtle Bay, (212)308-7720, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) JACQUELINE HUMPHRIES Gestural abstractions made with fluorescent paint, lighted by black lights, campy and eloquent. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)995-1785, closing tomorrow.(Kimmelman) RINKO KAWAUCHI: 'AILA AND THE EYES, THE EARS' In her second New York show this young Japanese photographer is showing large pale close-ups of natural phenomenon -- fish eggs, dead chickens, a hatching bird -- reminding us with oddly visionary effects that life's big themes are in the details. Cohan and Leslie, 138 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-8711, closing tomorrow. (Smith) ANNETTE LAWRENCE Ms. Lawrence, who is known for abstract works symbolizing themes of African-American ancestry, here presents an airy, expansive installation of many lengths of white string stretched in horizontal lines across the gallery. It is nicely complemented by musically suggestive drawings on brown paper composed of parallel pencil lines and calligraphic blobs in black, white and blood red. Betty Cunningham, 541 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-2772, closing on Wednesday. (Johnson) RICHARD PRINCE A well-chosen assortment of works from the past 25 years by this influential Neo-Pop semiotician includes joke paintings, car hood sculptures and photographs of scruffy upstate New York landscapes. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-9300, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) * NEO RAUCH In his familiar and fashionable vein, mixing Pop, Surrealism, Socialist Realism and a stew of 19th-century sources, these latest paintings are more tours de force of labor and oddball design, chilly and sophisticated. The work is operating at a level where the air is thin and cold. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2070, closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman) JEFF SONHOUSE: 'THE PANOPTIC CON' As sharp visually as they are politically, Mr. Sonhouse's compact, finely painted Pop-Surrealist portraits depict masked African-American men in colorful tuxedos with hair made of real matches, steel wool and other materials. In some, subjects are shown twice, mug-shot style: face-forward and in profile. These slyly incendiary works probe the mystique of the mythic scary-sexy black dude. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212)989-0082, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) STURTEVANT: 'PUSH AND SHOVE' The artist known for copying works by Warhol, Johns and other contemporary artists presents a darkly elegant installation of fake Duchamps, including a ceiling of 1,200 scrotumlike coal bags, a urinal, two bottle racks and a snow shovel. Perry Rubenstein, 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)627-8000, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) HIROSHI SUGITO AND ROSILINE LUDUVICO The Japan-based Mr. Sugito and the Germany-based Ms. Luduvico bring compatible sensibilities to this dual show. Painted with wispy delicacy, her small pictures of people in the woods conjure sweet, sad moods. His most imposing painting, a large luminous field of patchy green punctuated by little butterflies, projects a vigorously sensuousness fantasy of pastoral bliss. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)243-3335, closing tomorrow.(Johnson) JEAN CLAUDE WOUTERS: 'PORTRAITS & NUDES -- SPIRIT' Through a process of re-photographing his prints, this French artist creates large, black-and-white photographs that are so pale it may take a second to see the ghostly image of a nude torso or, more hauntingly, the larger-than-life face that seems to gaze at us from an ethereal realm. Meyerowitz, 120 11th Avenue, at 20th Street, (212)414-2770, closing tomorrow.
