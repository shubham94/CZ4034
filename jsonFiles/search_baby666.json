It's a question millions of women ask themselves these days, as baby boomers near or recently past menopause try to decide whether to take hormone replacement. Joining them are millions of older women, many of whom have been taking estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progestin for years and wonder if it is wise to continue, as well as many others who wonder if it is wise to start. At issue is an oft-repeated finding that the use of hormone replacement is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, especially when the hormones are taken for upwards of 10 years or more. Although heart disease ultimately kills six times as many women as breast cancer and the cancers linked to hormone replacement tend to be highly curable, there is an emotional factor to consider: justifiably or not, breast cancer is the disease most feared by American women.", "headline": {"main": "Hormone Replacement: Weighing Risks and Benefits"}, "abstract": "Jane E Brody article on research suggesting that progestin, which many menopausal and postmenopausal women take in combination with estrogen, may be a more important factor than estrogen in development of breast cancers associated with hormone replacement therapy; notes that progestin was included in hormone regimen specifically to prevent estrogen from inducing endometrial cancer, a cancer of urterine lining; says that until issue is settled by studies now under way, a woman should evaluate potential benefits and risks based on her own family and personal medical history, as well as her comfort level with taking or not taking hormones (M)", "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1610, "_id": "4fd212c18eb7c8105d788f9b", "snippet": "''Should I or shouldn't I?''
