But exactly where the money went, and for precisely what, remains unknown. The money's disappearance became an issue in Iraq's election campaign, generating accusations between Iraq's defense minister and a rival. A1 At least 16 Iraqis were killed and dozens were wounded in separate car bomb attacks outside a mosque in Baghdad and near a wedding party south of the capital, according to Iraqi government and hospital officials.
