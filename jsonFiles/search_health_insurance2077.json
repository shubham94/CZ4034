Ms. Joffe has suffered from multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis, both of which have stabilized with treatment -- the removal of her colon for the colitis, and the medication, Avonex, for her MS. Prior to getting sick, Ms. Joffe had two successful careers, first as a multimedia producer and then as a professor of communications at Boston University. She became a coach because she wanted a job that she could do from home and that would be flexible enough to allow her to modify her schedule whenever she had a bad day. She credits her ability to make that career change to the fact that her husband had a good health insurance policy that could cover her as well -- yet another example of health insurance affecting a career choice.", "headline": {"main": "Working While Chronically Ill", "kicker": "Shifting Careers"}, "abstract": "After bouts with debilitating illnesses, one women turns her experience into a way to help others, and to earn a living.", "print_page": null, "word_count": 369, "_id": "4fd36b0f8eb7c8105d8bf67b", "snippet": "After bouts with debilitating illnesses, one women turns her experience into a way to help others, and to earn a living.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/21/working-while-chronically-ill/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Marci", "lastname": "ALBOHER"}], "original": "By MARCI ALBOHER"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2008-04-21T19:17:10Z", "section_name": "Business"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": "The following post covers issues related to the deer population in the United States, from debates and information on how to manage the white-tail herds in the Northeast to discussions about hunting to advice on how to build a deer fence.", "headline": {"main": "Deer and Deer Management", "kicker": "Times Topics"}, "abstract": "The following post covers issues related to the deer population in the United States, from debates and information on how to manage the white-tail herds in the Northeast to discussions about hunting to advice on how to build a deer fence.
