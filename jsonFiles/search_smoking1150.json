The study indicated that there were about as many heart attack victims among those who smoked cigarettes with as little nicotine as 0.8 milligrams per cigarette as there were among those who smoked brands containing more than 1.5 milligrams.", "snippet": "A yearlong study of hospitalized heart attack patients has shown that the risk of suffering a heart attack was just as great among smokers who used low-nicotine cigarettes as it was among those who used high-nicotine brands.
