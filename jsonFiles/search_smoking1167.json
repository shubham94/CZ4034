Recent studies are expanding on earlier research showing that compared with the married, never-married and widowed, divorced adults have higher rates of emotional disturbance, accidental death and death from heart disease, cancer, pneumonia, high blood pressure and cirrhosis of the liver. One often-cited analysis of national mortality data showed that for deaths that could be related to psychological functioning, the divorced were worse off than the widowed in eight of 10 categories. For example, in comparison with the suicide rate for married women, which was the lowest, the rate was one and a half times higher for single women, more than twice as great for widowed women and almost three and a half times higher for women who were separated or divorced. Yet, experts say, relatively little professional attention has been paid to the health consequences of divorce and to helping people avoid them. According to Dr. Gerald F. Jacobson, director of the Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health Center in Culver City, Calif., author of ''The Multiple Crises of Marital Separation and Divorce (Grune & Stratton), there has been a ''disproportionate emphasis on the impact of divorce on children'' and not enough attention to how divorce affects the former spouses.", "snippet": "DIVORCE can exact a greater and in many cases longer-lasting emotional and physical toll on the former spouses than virtually any other life stress, including widowhood.
