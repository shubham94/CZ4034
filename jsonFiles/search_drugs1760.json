When the Manville Corporation, one of the nation's largest companies and the world leader in asbestos production, sought the safety of bankruptcy court last week amid a storm of product liability litigation the wind did shift, however slightly. Not only did the bankruptcy filing spotlight a new method for handling the litigation, it also focused attention on a longstanding failure of the legal system.

The new rules are changing the shape of the Federal-state program created 17 years ago to finance medical care for the poor. The program now provides benefits to 22.9 million people, or one out of 10 Americans, at a total cost to Federal and state governments of $33.9 billion this year. No Changes Yet in Region Gov. James R. Thompson of Illinois, a Republican, summarized the attitude of officials in a growing number of states when he said, ''We cannot afford a Cadillac Medicaid program when a Chevrolet will do.''

The states set eligibility criteria and define the scope of benefits within guidelines established by Washington.
