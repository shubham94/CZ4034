Medical employment grew last year by 7.7 percent, the biggest increase in two decades and the biggest rise for any major category of employment tabulated by the Government. All signs point to further growth even though the nation is in what many economists believe is a mild recession, with the overall jobless rate at the highest level in more than three years. New technology, the increasing number of elderly people, the AIDS epidemic and the increase in health-care spending contributed to the growth of employment in health services. The number of jobs in the industry rose 600,600 last year, to 8.4 million. Fast-Growing Occupations The number of health-care workers grew more than 50 percent in the 1980's, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that 7 of the 10 fastest growing occupations in the 1990's will be in health care. Those occupations include physician assistants, home health aides, X-ray technologists, medical secretaries, physical therapists and surgical technicians. Some experts express concern about the trend and its effect on health care costs, while acknowledging that there seems to be an insatiable demand for health care. \"Productivity in the hospital industry declined in the 1980's,\" said Prof. Gerard F. Anderson, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at Johns Hopkins University. \"There were more employees in the hospital industry in 1990 than in 1980, and yet the industry produced about the same amount of care as in 1980.\" Personnel costs generally account for 70 percent to 80 percent of all health-care spending, Professor Anderson said. Steady Increase Health-care employment grew 5.2 percent in 1988 and 6.7 percent in 1989. The rate of increase has steadily risen over the last six years. In monthly reports since June, the Labor Department has reported that hundreds of thousands of workers are losing jobs in factories, auto plants, the construction industry, retail stores, banks and the real estate industry. Buried in those reports, there is often a statement to the effect that the health-care industry \"continued its pattern of strong growth,\" adding an average of 50,000 jobs a month. With Federal, state and local governments and private insurers paying nearly 75 percent of the $585 billion spent on personal health care last year, doctors and hospitals were insulated from some of the economic pressures that forced other employers to lay off workers. But many hospital executives say their net revenue and profit margins declined substantially in recent years as the Federal Government and private insurers began to limit reimbursement. The number of workers providing home health care rose 19 percent last year, to 315,000, the Labor Department said. At the same time, it said, employment in doctors' offices went up 10 percent, to 1.5 million; 7 percent in nursing homes, to 1.5 million, and 6 percent in hospitals, to 3.8 million. \"You hear about cutbacks in the health-care industry, but employment continues to grow pell-mell,\" said Lawrence H. Leith, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Two Sides of a Coin Prof. Eli Ginzberg, an economist at Columbia University who has been studying health care personnel for 50 years, said the trend should not come as a surprise. \"As long as the dollars spent on health care keep increasing, employment will continue to grow,\" he said. \"The two things are opposite sides of the same coin.\" Professor Ginzberg added: \"In the health-care industry, you have a financial system different from any other part of the American economy. In the private sector, the number of people you can hire is normally determined by a budget or by market forces. But it doesn't work that way in the health-care industry because financing is virtually open-ended.\" In other industries, technology often displaces or replaces workers. But new health-care technology has increased the demand for highly trained technicians and technologists to operate the equipment. \"New technologies are the most important factor boosting the demand for health services,\" said Valerie A. Personick, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Because of advances, patients are likely to undergo more tests and diagnostic procedures, take more drugs, see more specialists and be subjected to more aggressive treatments than before.\" Connie R. Curran, a registered nurse and consultant to many hospitals, said: \"Technology is going wild. It's driving the demand for nurses and other health-care workers. As technology becomes more sophisticated, we can take care of patients who are more severely ill and they need more care than ever before. The nurse is caring for a much sicker patient and is also caring for the machine.\" New Job Needs Sharon Flynn Hollander, director of nursing at the 660-bed Stanford University Hospital in California, cited pediatric heart surgery in illustrating how new technology increases demand for nurses. In a procedure used on critically ill infants, blood is drained out of a baby's body so that it bypasses the heart and lungs. The blood absorbs oxygen in an artificial lung and is then pumped back into the baby's blood vessels. Typically, the use of this technique requires two nurses, one to watch the baby and one to monitor the equipment for several days after surgery. The aging of the population has also increased demand for health-care workers. The Census Bureau estimates that in the year 2000 there will be 4.6 million Americans 85 years old or older, double the number in 1980. The increase in the number of elderly people has in turn raised the demand for health care services in the home. Rise in Registered Nurses The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the number of registered nurses will increase 39 percent, to 2.2 million, in the year 2000. Many nursing homes now provide specialized care to people with severe head injuries, to stroke victims and to patients who need the help of a mechanical respirator to breath. But to care for such patients, the nursing homes need physical therapists and respiratory therapists, and those are two of the fastest growing occupations. The bureau estimates that the number of physical therapists will increase 57 percent, to 107,000, in the year 2000, while the number of respiratory therapists will rise 41 percent, to 79,000.", "headline": {"main": "Against Trend, Health-Care Jobs Rise"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "19", "word_count": 1042, "_id": "4fd1c5cb8eb7c8105d6f66b3", "snippet": "While hundreds of thousands of workers are being laid off around the country, employment in the health-care industry is booming.
