Born March 26, 1930, in New York City, Betsy was the daughter of Warren Brewer and Elizabeth Miller Hunt. Betsy had a lifelong commitment to community service. She was a current member of the Leadership Council of the Harvard School of Public Health. Her most recent support led to the founding of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, a research and academic center devoted to advancing humanitarian practice, government and international policy in the protection of the world's most vulnerable people and the training of the next generation of humanitarian leaders. She devoted over 36 years to Greenwich Hospital as a volunteer in the emergency room. She also served as Chair of Emergency Room Volunteers, was on the Hospital Disaster Team and was a board member of the Executive Comittee of the Greenwich Hospital Auxiliary. She served as president of the Old Greenwich Riverside Community Center for several years and was a trustee of the Greenwich Library. She served as board member of the Greenwich Adult & Continuing Education and the Community Cooperative Nursery School. She served on the Greenwich Arts Council, Junior League of Greenwich, and was on the PTA for Riverside Elementary School, Eastern Junior High School, Greenwich High School, and Brunswick School. Betsy loved to sing with the Blue Hill Troupe Ltd. and with the Greenwich Choral Society. What she loved even more was being with her family. Her love of the sea, sailing down the Intercoastal Waterway with her parents, crewing for her husband on Long Island Sound, and boating on Penobscot Bay with her grandchildren were some of her cherished times. She loved to travel, but mostly only with or where there was family. If Betsy could have, she would have saved every puppy in the window. There was never a moment in her life where there wasn't at least one dog by her side. She's survived by Rocky. Betsy was the first female ocean marine underwriter of the Insurance Company of North America, in Philadelphia. She later worked as the Administrative Assistant for the President and Chairman of the Board of American Sugar Refining Company in New York. She attended Rippowam Elementary School in Bedford, NY, Friends School of Wilmington, Delaware, Chapin School, NY, NY, and graduated in 1950 from Briarcliff College. In addition to her husband of 513/4 years, J. Fred Weintz, Jr., a retired partner of Goldman Sachs & Co., she is survived by her brothers Warren Brewer, Jr. of Cambridge, MA, and Roger Conant Brewer of Indialantic, FL; her daughters Elizabeth Weintz ''Beppie'' Cerf of Falmouth, ME, Polly Weintz Sanna of Cos Cob, CT, her sons Dr. Eric Cortelyou Weintz of Menlo Park, CA and Karl Frederick Weintz of Boston, MA; and her grandchildren Elisabeth Brewer ''Brett'' Cerf, Robert Frederick ''Rick'' Cerf, Warren Barrett ''Bart'' Cerf, Jonathan Cortelyou ''Jake'' Cerf, Lucy Hamlin Sanna, Cortney Curtis Weintz, and Bryce Cortelyou Weintz. She was predeceased by their first born son, Frederick Cortelyou ''Rickie'' Weintz, who died in infancy in 1962. A memorial service will be held Wednesday, August 29, at 11am at Christ Church, 126 E.
