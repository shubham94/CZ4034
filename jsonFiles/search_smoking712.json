High atop the dome stands a statue called ''The Independent Man'' -- a representation of Roger Williams, the Puritan founder of Providence. ''Because of Williams's religious beliefs, he was thrown out of Boston,'' McCully says now. ''It sounded familiar.'' McCully, too, felt like an outcast when he went to Providence from Boston, though he was a scientific rather than a religious infidel. He had left appointments at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital under a cloud, told that his research had dead-ended. He had been denounced by some fellow scientists and ignored by others. His research grants had withered away. He took refuge in a pathology job far from the fast track at the Providence Veterans Administration Medical Center. These are distinctly better days for McCully, who is now 63. His lifetime's study of a little-understood trigger for heart disease is suddenly at the forefront of cardiac research. His theory -- the same one that came close to scuttling his career -- holds that homocysteine, an amino acid in the blood, damages artery walls and causes heart attacks, and that in most cases homocysteine can easily be lowered to safe levels by taking certain common vitamins. If he's right, homocysteine could join cholesterol, smoking and high blood pressure as a major culprit of heart disease, accounting for (and perhaps someday preventing) upward of 10 to 15 percent of all cases. For an illness that kills nearly 1,500 Americans a day, these are serious numbers.", "snippet": "In 1981, when kilmer mccully started commuting from his home in a boston suburb to a new job in Providence, R.I., he would drive past the domed Rhode Island Capitol.
