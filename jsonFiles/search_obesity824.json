In The New England Journal of Medicine, a team of Yale pediatricians reported glucose intolerance in about 25 percent of the obese children and adolescents they studied. That finding indicates a much greater susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes, a leading cause of heart and kidney disease, blindness and death in the United States. At the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, doctors at the University of Cincinnati reported that 25 percent of the obese adolescents and young adults they studied had enlargements of the left ventricles of their hearts -- a condition highly predictive of future heart disease.", "snippet": "AT this late date, few Americans need to be warned that ours is a nation of expanding waistlines.
