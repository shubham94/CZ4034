The researchers, led by a team from Columbia University, looked at babies born to women living in Harlem and Washington Heights, and divided them into four groups, based on the amounts of the pesticides chlorpyrifos and diazinon found in the mothers' blood and umbilical cord blood. In the group with the highest levels, babies averaged 6.6 ounces lighter and one-third of an inch shorter than those in the group with no measurable amount of the insecticides in the blood.", "snippet": "Pregnant women in upper Manhattan who were heavily exposed to two common insecticides had smaller babies than their neighbors, but recent restrictions on the two substances quickly lowered exposure and increased babies' size, according to a study..."}], "meta": {"offset": 0, "hits": 1, "time": 267}}}
