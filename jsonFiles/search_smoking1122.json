AFTER YEARS OF CANCER ALARMS,PROGRESS AMID THE MISTAKES Yesterday, it was dioxin, a contaminant found in many chemical products, including Agent Orange, the herbicide used to defoliate the jungles of Vietnam. And before that, stretching back a decade or more, the roster of commercial and industrial chemicals suspected or known to cause cancer included the pesticides DDT and Kepone; the artifical sweeteners cyclamate and saccharin; the synthetic hormone DES; the industrial chemicals asbestos, vinyl chloride, benzene, formaldehyde and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's); such consumer products as hair dyes and children's nightgowns treated with Tris, a flame retardant; and even such common items in the American diet as coffee and charcoal-broiled steaks. These and dozens of other substances like them were accused of causing cancer and often other health or environmental damage. Each flared briefly into public prominence, generating headlines, scientific debate and political or legal or regulatory proceedings. In the end most were subjected to regulatory restrictions or, in a few cases, banned entirely. Each then disappeared from public debate, to be replaced shortly by the next ''carcinogen of the month.'' This chemical carcinogens, among all the causes of cancer, have for the most part attracted the greatest amount of public and regulatory attention.", "snippet": "Today, the focus of public and regulatory attention is EDB, or ethylene dibromide, a pesticide that was widely used to fumigate grain, citrus fruit and soil until residues were detected in drinking water and food products.
