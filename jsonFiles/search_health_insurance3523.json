Later in the campaign, we will be looking at the details of their plans. But at this early stage, we feel it would be useful to define some broad principles that ought to govern the choice of potential tax cuts. The threshold question that needs to be asked is whether tax cuts of any kind are the best way to bring about economic growth as well as progressive policy goals like expanded health care. If there is to be a tax cut, it should make the tax code more simple, fair and progressive. Progres-sivity is a time-honored principle often forgotten in the political debates. But since the beginning of this century, Americans have consistently embraced the principle that calls for the wealthy to pay proportionately larger shares of their income in taxes. The tax system became less progressive after the tax cuts of President Ronald Reagan and more progressive after tax increases under Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton. The latest Treasury estimate is that the top fifth of American families accounts for 56.7 percent of American family income but 65.1 percent of total federal tax revenues. The top 1 percent accounts for 14.8 percent of total income and 20.1 percent of tax revenues.
