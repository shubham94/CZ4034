You can identify most writers by their books; you can pick out Mr. Elkin by his sentences, or even phrases. ''The peculiar dignity of men seen eating alone in restaurants on national holidays'' ''The medallion, like a metal moon, would catch the light of the electric bulb, and sifting it in its complex corrugated surfaces, throw off thick rings of bright yellow which seemed to sear themselves into his outstretched, upraised hands.'' In his previous work, Mr. Elkin's language is always a surprise and a joy. A teen-age hooligan speaks like Hamlet in ''Push, the Bully,'' a liquor store owner speaks convincingly from the grave in ''The Living End.'' Mr. Elkin tortures language the way fate usually tortures his characters, but Mr. Elkin is kinder than fate and more fruitful.
