Economics, he explains, is about choice. It asks how people respond to incentives, how they respond to constraints. And so, Dr. Fuchs observes, ''economics is the quintessential policy science.'' Dr. Fuchs, an emeritus professor of economics, holds half a dozen titles at Stanford University and is continuing his research while serving on the steering committee of Stanford's Center for Biomedical Ethics and as a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research. He is also a past president of the American Economic Association and a member of the American Philosophical Society and of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences.", "snippet": "Dr. Victor Fuchs is an economist who also sees himself as a humanist, a person who is interested in values and who inquires how economics can help people to think about social problems and arrive at solutions.
