We've come a long way from the World War II era, when federal officials were passing out copies of a food pyramid that gave butter a category all its own. But the fast-food addict who is thrilled by news of new, improved French fries is much like the smoker who believes switching to low-tar cigarettes is a sign of terrific progress. The new vegetable oil that will be used beginning next month by the chain, which has more than 13,000 restaurants nationwide, will reduce the levels of artery-clogging saturated fat and trans fatty acids in fried foods on the menu, while increasing the amount of polyunsaturated fat. That is the good kind of fat that researchers say tends to lower cholesterol. The shift, which is one other fast-food chains may follow, is a step in the right direction, potentially cutting customers' risk of heart disease.", "snippet": "It's hard to say whether the news that McDonald's will be making lower-fat French fries should be regarded as a public-health victory.
