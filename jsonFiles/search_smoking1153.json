He looked out at us from millions of television screens across the nation, a latter-day Lazarus, a man whose life had been forfeit. A few weeks ago, calmly sitting there in Salt Lake City in his blue pajamas and red dressing gown, Dr. Barney B. Clark talked easily if somewhat breathlessly for the video cameras. It seemed impossible that just three months earlier he had been rushed into an operating room in the evening, so near death that the surgery could not wait until the next morning. We have all been caught up in the drama. For the first time, an alien object made of metal and plastic has permanently taken the place of a failing heart. As of this writing, 15 weeks after the operation, the courageous patient has fought his way past one setback after another. The two men most intimately responsible for the achievement -Dr. William C. DeVries, the surgeon, and Dr. Robert K. Jarvik, the designer of the artificial heart -have become national figures.", "snippet": "Harry Schwartz, writer-in-residence at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, is a former member of The New York Times's editorial board.

Clark's death late Wednesday night was a result of massive circulatory collapse, shock and failure of all the organs in his body except the artificial heart, which continued to pump even after he was dead, his doctors at the University of Utah said today. They also said the process had probably been brought on as a complication of the antibiotic therapy Dr. Clark received for the aspiration pneumonia he developed March 3. The clinical findings were verified by an autopsy that was done immediately after Dr. Clark's death and that showed ''no surprises,'' Dr. William C. DeVries, head of the team that cared for him, said at a news conference. He added, ''There was nothing significant that we missed,'' meaning that the doctors had diagnosed and treated Dr. Clark properly. Dr. Chase N. Peterson, the university's vice president for health sciences, said of the 62-year-old patient, the first to live with an artificial heart for an extended period of time, that ''everything failed'' except the heart.", "snippet": "Dr. Barney B.

But it seems to help and they probably suffer no ill effects. Peruvian Indians have been using it for generations. ''At the other end of the spectrum,'' said Dr. Robert Byck of Yale University, an expert on cocaine, ''is a man I encountered who was spending $400,000 a year, buying cocaine by the half pound, and shooting it intravenously. He was sitting in a blacked-out cellar with an M-1 rifle, shooting at his hallucinations.'' The man in the basement and the hotel guests in Cuzco were taking the same drug. The two uses point up the dramatic difference in reactions to which many Americans are now subjecting themselves. Use of illicit drugs is continuing to rise among American adults, and social scientists believe that to a large extent this usage has become increasingly ''acceptable'' on all levels of American society. To medical experts, such acceptance represents dangerous ignorance. ''The selection in the delicatessen of drugs is much greater than its ever been,'' says Dr. M. Duncan Stantan of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Some of these natural or artificially produced chemicals are new or recently produced variants of older forms that are better understood than the new ones.", "snippet": "AMERICAN hotel guests in Cuzco, Peru, 12,000 feet high in the Andes, are sometimes surprised at being offered coca tea to help them adjust to the altitude.
