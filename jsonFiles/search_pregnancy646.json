(CMT) PETTY BLUE Think of Nascar, and chances are the name Petty is going to come to mind. This new documentary follows the family dynasty around the track, starting with its patriarch, Lee Petty (above, center, with his sons Maurice, left, and Richard), who raced under No. 42 and was the face of Nascar's earliest days in 1949. It continues with his son Richard (No. 43), the Hall of Famer and driver with the most wins in the sport's history -- and the only motor sports athlete to earn the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- and Richard's son, Kyle (No. 44), who has twice won one of Nascar's most prominent honors, the Myers Brothers Award. It also follows the family tragedy. In 2000 Kyle's son Adam (No. 45) was killed, more than 50 years after his great-grandfather's first race, when the throttle of his car stuck while he was practicing in New Hampshire -- sending him barreling into a wall. Kevin Costner narrates this film, whose title refers to the distinctive blue color of Richard's cars in the 1960s and '70s, the most famous of which was probably the Plymouth Superbird -- the character Richard played in the 2006 animated Pixar film ''Cars.'' In ''Invitation Only,'' at 10, Toby Keith performs songs from his new album, including the title track, ''Bullets in the Gun,'' as well as ''Somewhere Else'' and his latest single, ''Trailerhood.'' He backs them up with old favorites, among them ''Good as I Once Was'' and ''I Love This Bar,'' and answers audience questions. 8 P.M.
