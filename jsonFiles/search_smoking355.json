The 1980 cult roller-disco film about a Greek muse sent to earth goes Broadway -- and it's about time. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Ra\u00fal Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'CRAZY MARY' Sigourney Weaver and Kristine Nielsen serve their specialties (WASP tartness, madcap madness) with such gusto in A. R. Gurney's comedy that it feels ungallant to point out that their characters are as artificial as hard-plastic dolls. A contrived play that never quite connects its thoughtful mind with its sentimental heart (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'ELECTRA' An ''adaptation'' of Sophocles' play that is more of a spoof of a Greek tragedy than any serious attempt to revive one (1:10). The HAS Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, at 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 868-4444.(Wilborn Hampton) 'ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATER MARATHON 2007: SERIES A' Neil LaBute's contemporary gloss on a classic tale of Greek vengeance is the highlight of the first round in this annual series of short plays. Dana Delany and Victor Slezak are woman scorned and cad of a hubby in a gruesome drama that packs a visceral punch. Unfortunately, Mr. LaBute's play comes last in a mostly unrewarding program (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'FATE'S IMAGINATION' Sex and politics, a natural combination in real life, don't mesh very well in Randall David Cook's play, but his ear for humor makes this comic drama about a politician's son who has a fling with an older woman pretty entertaining anyway (1:30). Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clich\u00e9d feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Ginia Bellafante) 'HORIZON' God is in the curriculum in Rinde Eckert's lively portrait of a theologian, an homage to the ''Christian realism'' of Reinhold Niebuhr. But even the fiercest secularist should find pleasure in this engaging performance piece, set in the seminary-without-walls of one man's mind (1:25). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-8996. (Brantley) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clich\u00e9d territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) * 'PASSING STRANGE' The composer and performer Stew narrates this semiautobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the Los Angeles-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) 'TEA' Age-blind casting is a great strength of the Pan Asian Repertory Theater's production of this play about four Japanese war brides who gather in 1968 to clean up the house of a fifth, who has killed herself. Velina Hasu Houston's play requires the five actresses to portray their characters at every stage of their lives, and it works well that some of them actually are young, while others, like Ako, who plays the uptight, more-Japanese-than-thou Atsuko, are well into middle age. But the play itself crams verbiage and melodrama into what feels like a television epic, complete with that most stereotypical of figures, the dead woman's ghost seeking liberation into the next world. The whole thing goes down like a long soap opera, though the actresses do their best to bring it all to life (1:30). West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette) Off Off Broadway 'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'ROMEO AND JULIET' Shakespeare imagined many things, yet perhaps even he wouldn't have envisioned this classic tragedy as a musical. The director Ellen Stewart has added many new elements, but the sum remains woefully less than its parts (2:15). LaMaMa E.T.C. Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Claudia La Rocco) 'TIME FLIES AND OTHERS BY IVES' An amusing collection of comic playlets by David Ives embraces the little guy (1:35). Laurie Beechman Theater, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' A writhing green blob with music (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ALL HER FACES: A PORTRAIT OF DUSTY SPRINGFIELD' There's no accounting for fans, as proved by Anthony Inneo's loving but slight tribute to Springfield. If you know the lyrics well enough to sing along, you could do worse than spend an hour listening to some of that English diva's hits, barely packaged in the shape of a play (1:15). La MaMa E.T.C. (the Club), 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (La Rocco) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'CIRKUS INFERNO' Happy lunacy (1:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912; closes on Sunday. (Gates) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'MAUD, THE MADNESS' The familiarity of many quotations from the works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson has done nothing to allay my philistine sense of that poet as dated and uneven in quality. This dramatized version of his epic poem ''Maud,'' which he termed a monodrama, does little to dispel such prejudice. Although the actor Jonathan Tindle and the director Niegel Smith have made a prodigious effort to lift Lord Alfred's words off the page, the mad Gothic protagonist they create is unappealing, and his flowery words remain a monument to an aesthetic of another time (1:30). June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 352-3101. ( Midgette) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'PHALLACY' Art and science collide in this play by Carl Djerassi, but it's not much of a mash-up; a chemist proves that a curator's prize sculpture has been misdated, and there's not much refuting the evidence (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'rosebud: the lives of orson welles' Cineastes will feel cheated by the Welsh playwright Mark Jenkins's effort to cover all the well-known triumphs and tragedies of this legendary filmmaker's life in under 90 minutes. He walks briskly and rests nowhere long enough. This is a one-man show, and Christian McKay, however, is Welles to the soles of his feet (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AMU' (No rating, 102 minutes, in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi) This ambitious first feature by Shonali Bose, about Kaju, a young Indian-American woman searching for the real India and for her roots, begins as a gentle comedy of cultures clashing. Its true topic, though, is the riots that broke out in Delhi in 1984 after Indira Gandhi's assassination. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and as Kaju learns, justice has been delayed and denied. (Rachel Saltz) 'ANGEL-A' (R, 90 minutes) Beneath its sophisticated Gallic gloss, this handsomely photographed feel-good fantasy, which shamelessly recycles ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Heaven Can Wait,'' suggests an episode of ''Touched by an Angel'' without the tears. (Stephen Holden) * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'THE BOSS OF IT ALL' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Danish) To describe ''The Boss of It All,'' Lars von Trier's acidic corporate comedy, as '' 'The Office' viewed through the looking glass'' only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. (Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt this film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, its story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden) 'BUG' (R, 102 minutes) In this overwrought psychodrama from the director William Friedkin, Ashley Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a shaky Oklahoma barmaid, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon) who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere. Though the movie's escalating hysteria may strain credulity, Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'CRAZY LOVE' (PG-13, 92 minutes) Love is blind, and so too is Linda Pugach, one of the loony-tuners in Dan Klores's somewhat sickening, mildly gonzo documentary. In 1959 Mrs. Pugach, then 22 and known as Linda Riss, was blinded by her husband-to-be Burton Pugach, a Bronx ambulance chaser who single-mindedly pursued the object of his obsession all the way to the marriage altar. (Dargis) 'DAY WATCH' (R, 140 minutes, in Russian) Picking up a number of years after ''Night Watch'' concludes, this second installment in Timur Bekmambetov's bustling supernatural trilogy dazzles and confuses with equal determination. Less coherent than its predecessor, if equally creative, the movie depicts hidden dimensions teeming with beings who swap bodies at will and rewrite destiny with something called the Chalk of Fate. Perhaps the Fickle Finger was otherwise engaged. (Catsoulis) 'FAY GRIM' (R, 118 minutes) Too light-headed to qualify as satire, too poker-faced to register as comedy, this elaborate spy spoof, a sequel to ''Henry Fool,'' belongs in its own stylistic niche: the Hal Hartley film. Movies emanating from Planet Hartley are an acquired taste shared by hipper-than-thou insiders. (Holden) 'THE FIFTH EMPIRE' (No rating, 127 minutes, in Portuguese) With this stubbornly static, talky drama about a young Portuguese king hoping to unite his troubled nation by embarking on a foreign adventure, the prolific 98-year-old director Manoel de Oliveira pushes his already minimalist style about as far as it can go. At the same time, though, Mr. Olivieira's aesthetic is in sync with his main interest: capturing characters' words and gestures in real time as they work through philosophical and political conundrums while remaining largely oblivious to the physical world around them. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott) * 'GRACIE' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Set in New Jersey in 1978, Davis Guggenheim's sensitive underdog tale depicts the obstacles faced by a young girl who dreams of playing on her high school's all-boy soccer team. While connecting the familiar adversity-drama dots -- the beat-down, the pickup, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter -- the movie's follow-your-heart simplicity masks an unusual degree of emotional complexity. (Catsoulis) * 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) * 'KNOCKED UP' (R, 129 minutes) Foul of mouth and true of heart, this new comedy from Judd Apatow (''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'') captures the sexual and moral confusion of the present moment remarkably well. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are unlikely bedfellows but perfect comic foils as a shlub-babe couple whose one-night stand leans to an unintended but not unwelcome pregnancy. (Scott) 'MR. BROOKS' (R, 120 minutes) Kevin Costner and William Hurt camp it up as a serial killer and his demonic alter ego in ''Mr. Brooks,'' a werewolf movie masquerading as a sophisticated thriller. (Holden) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) * 'PAPRIKA' (R, 90 minutes, in Japanese) In this gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close. Satoshi Kon's mind-twisting, eye-tickling anim\u00e9 isn't greasy kid's stuff: it's for thinking, interested adults whose sense of wonder remains as alive as their imaginations. (Dargis) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Seitz) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Saltz) * 'TEN CANOES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in various Yolngu Aboriginal dialects) There is nothing more enthralling than a good yarn, and the mesmerizing ''Ten Canoes'' interweaves two versions of the same Australian Aboriginal fable, one filmed in black and white and set a thousand years ago and an even older one, filmed in color and set in prehistoric times. (Holden) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series and Revivals LINDSAY ANDERSON'S MICK TRAVIS TRILOGY (Wednesday and Thursday) The British director Lindsay Anderson made three films centered on his everyman character, Mick Travis, played by Malcolm McDowell as a public school rebel in ''If '' (1968), as a disillusioned traveling coffee salesman in ''O Lucky Man!'' (1973) and finally as a hapless victim of the collapsing English health care system in ''Britannia Hospital'' (1982). Anthology Film Archives has managed to assemble all three features for rare sequential screenings -- no easy feat, because each film is controlled by a different company. The screenings begin on Wednesday with ''If '' and ''O Lucky Man!'' and continue on Thursday with ''O Lucky Man!'' and ''Britannia Hospital.'' The films continue in rotation through June 17. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Dave Kehr) SAM FULLER (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image wraps up its retrospective of the vivid, visceral work of this tabloid reporter turned filmmaker this weekend with screenings of the restored 158-minute version of his World War II epic, ''The Big Red One'' (1980), as well as three rarely shown films from Fuller's late period: ''Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street'' (1972) and ''White Dog'' (1981) tomorrow, and ''Street of No Return'' (1982) on Sunday. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr) THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE SINGER (Monday) A rare showing of Chris Marker's 1974 documentary about the French singer and political activist Yves Montand, presented with two short films by Mr. Marker, ''The Embassy'' (1973) and ''The Sixth Side of the Pentagon'' (1968). BAM Cin\u00e9matek, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; bam.org; $10. (Kehr) OPEN ROADS: NEW ITALIAN CINEMA (Today through Thursday) A selection of notable recent Italian films continues tonight with the premiere of Angelo Longoni's ''Caravaggio,'' which stars Alessio Boni (''The Best of Youth'') as the tempestuous painter of the title and features cinematography by another Italian master of light and shadow, Vittorio Storaro. Among the week's other highlights: ''In Memory of Me,'' the second feature of Saverio Costanzo (''Private''), about a young man who enters an island seminary (tomorrow and Wednesday); ''Primo Levi's Journey,'' a documentary by Davide Ferrario that traces Levi's path from the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp to his home in Turin (Wednesday and Thursday); and ''See Naples and Die,'' an examination of the city in all of its glory and squalor, directed by Enrico Caria (tomorrow and Monday). Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * LILY ALLEN (Tuesday) A 22-year-old British singer with deceptively sweet, ska-infused electro-pop songs, Ms. Allen is at her best when snarkily putting down disagreeable suitors. ''Smile,'' a No. 1 hit in England, is pure schadenfreude, and ''Knock 'Em Out'' a catalog of snappy answers to bad pickup lines: ''I've got herpes. No, I've got syphilis.'' With Kevin Michael. At 6:45 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario) ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI, BLACK MOTH SUPER RAINBOW (Tonight) If the musical segments on ''Sesame Street'' were made with a chamber orchestra and choir and intended for an audience of hyperintelligent prodigies, they might sound something like Architecture in Helsinki, from Australia: frolicsome and inventive, as if every instrument were being played for the first time. Black Moth Super Rainbow, from Pittsburgh, delivers shimmering psychedelia through a screen of pulsating keyboards and blissed-out, robotic vocals. With Santogold. At 9, Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario) BABY GRAMPS (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday) With a gray beard the size of small shrubbery, a raspy Popeye voice and manic skills on the steel guitar, Baby Gramps offers a cartoonish variation on the role of hobo troubadour in old-timey songs like ''Big Rock Candy Mountain.'' But where he really shines is with hilarious and ingenious wordplay, as in his palindrome song (''Go hang a salami -- I'm a lasagna hog''). Tonight at 7, Terra Blues, 149 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-7776, terrablues.com; $10. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10. Tuesday at 8 p.m., with Kill Henry Sugar, at the Gershwin Hotel, 7 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (646) 207-0595, gershwinhotel.com; $10. (Sisario) EEF BARZELAY (Wednesday) With a homely, nasal tenor and a few lonesome strums on his guitar, Mr. Barzelay, of the band Clem Snide, can render heartache with trompe-l'oeil precision or, if the mood strikes him, simply goof off. In one song on his latest solo album, ''Bitter Honey'' (SpinArt), he takes on the persona of a woman whose rear end makes an appearance in a hip-hop video: ''It was on screen for a second but was kind of hard to miss.'' At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) BOOKER T. AND THE MG'S, SHARON JONES (Wednesday and Thursday) As the house band of Stax Records in the 1960s, Booker T. Jones and his crew had an incalculable role in the creation of Southern soul-funk, mixing musky blues with house-rocking R&B grooves built around the whirr of the organ. Sharon Jones is the queen of an active local scene that recreates, spiritedly but not too pedantically, the vintage Stax sound. Wednesday at 7 p.m., Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, rivertorivernyc.com; Thursday at noon, BAM Rhythm & Blues Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, downtown Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; both free. (Sisario) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) * CARTEL (Tuesday) Those polished, punky riffs and bright singalong choruses straight out of the Blink-182 playbook are not the only signs that this Atlanta band isn't averse to blatant commercialism. Since May 24, Cartel has been inside a giant fiberglass bubble on Pier 54 in Manhattan, recording its second album in a carefully choreographed publicity stunt that involves an MTV reality show and Web tie-ins from Dr Pepper. On Tuesday the band emerges from the bubble and plays a concert on the pier. Presumably Dr Pepper will be on sale. At 6 p.m., Hudson River at 13th Street, West Village, (212) 533-7275, hudsonriverpark.org; free. (Sisario) THE CLIENTELE (Tonight) There's comfort in familiarity, and the soft, sweetly finessed songs by this veteran British indie-cabaret band, with echoes of the Byrds' gleaming folk-rock and George Harrison's breathy calm -- expertly channeled by Alasdair Maclean -- are a seductive sonic cocoon. With Beach House and Pipas. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario) COWBOY JUNKIES (Wednesday) Almost 20 years ago this Toronto band released an instant classic with the somber and starkly elegant ''Trinity Session.'' And though on subsequent albums the Cowboy Junkies have never returned to that expressive peak, the delicate interplay between Margo Timmins's velvety alto and her brother Michael Timmins's muted guitar can be chillingly beautiful. At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $40. (Sisario) DEFTONES (Tonight and tomorrow night) Alternately glum and explosive, this long-running alt-metal band from Sacramento plays tightly compacted guitar riffs as the singer Chino Moreno howls and croons on themes of disintegration and decay. With Dir En Grey and the Fall of Troy. At 7:30, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $27.50 (sold out tomorrow). (Sisario) DUMPSTAPHUNK (Tonight) The MySpace image for Ivan Neville's new band gives an idea of where it's coming from: the site shows a satellite picture of Hurricane Katrina about to crash into New Orleans. Funk bands are supposed to be about good times, and Dumpstaphunk, the current reigning New Orleans funk outfit, provides that in abundance. But in angry, topical songs like ''Livin' in a World Gone Mad'' it also reminds us why the good vibes are so badly needed. At 11, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $17. (Sisario) * FEIST (Monday and Tuesday) Leslie Feist, who performs under her last name, has become a genuine star of the mellow indie-arty scene with deliciously melodic songs on grown-up topics that balance pop ambitions with outsider quirkiness. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; sold out. (Sisario) * HAPPY MONDAYS (Wednesday and Thursday) Working-class hedonists obsessed with the highs of trippy dance music (and with other kinds of highs), Happy Mondays embodied the ''Madchester'' rave-rock scene in Britain of the late 1980s and early '90s. In its latest reincarnation the band plays as the centerpiece of In the City of New York, a two-day conference organized by Tony Wilson, the Factory Records impresario who discovered Happy Mondays, as told in the film ''24 Hour Party People.'' At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com or inthecityofnewyork.com; $35. (Sisario) LONG BLONDES (Tomorrow) Kate Jackson of the Long Blondes, from Sheffield, England, has figured out at least one important thing about being a pop star: people listen to you when you look good. Her band has made a splash at home as much for its smart and catchy new wave update as for Ms. Jackson's vintage skirts and ''Marlene Dietrich-meets-rockabilly chic,'' as one magazine put it. With the Virgins and the King Left. At 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) BERT JANSCH (Sunday) One of the prime movers of the 1960s British folk scene, Mr. Jansch played knotty and expressive acoustic guitar that influenced Jimmy Page and Neil Young, and in songs like ''Needle of Death'' sang in an invitingly guileless voice of a bohemian demimonde. His appearance on the soundtrack to ''The Squid and the Whale'' and interest from neo-folk stars like Beth Orton and Devendra Banhart -- who both appear on his latest album, ''The Black Swan'' (Drag City) -- have introduced him to an appreciative young audience. With P. G. Six and Kevin Barker. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18. (Sisario) JOHN BROWN'S BODY (Tonight) Founded in Ithaca, N.Y., John Brown's Body plays old-fashioned reggae, sometimes updated with dub-inspired electronic effects; the results are less ham-fisted than you might think, which isn't saying much. With Trumystic and Quintus. At 9, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $17. (Kelefa Sanneh) LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO FLEETWOOD MAC (Tonight and tomorrow night) As Nick Lowe said, you've got to be cruel to be kind. Joe McGinty's enduring Loser's Lounge series, now 14, both honors and skewers pop greats with cleverly over-the-top performances, and turns its attention here to soft-rock's most incestuous hitmakers. At 7 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) MELT-BANANA (Sunday) The hiccups of guitar and squeals of vocals fly by so fast in the hyperactive music of Melt-Banana, from Japan, that it seems a minor miracle that so many playful pop melodies survive. With Drop Dead and Children. At 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) * NEVILLE BROTHERS (Thursday) Celebrate Brooklyn opens with one of the musical jewels of New Orleans, whose funk lineage stretches back to the 1950s, when the keyboardist Art Neville recorded ''Mardi Gras Mambo'' with the Hawketts. At 5:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, brooklynx.org; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario) LEE (SCRATCH) PERRY (Thursday) Mr. Perry's quirks are inseparable from his inspirations. He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences. As a performer, he sings and rants, with lucid nuggets surrounded by malarkey as he discourses on space aliens, sex, the International Monetary Fund and marijuana. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles) PINK MARTINI (Wednesday) The Hollywood lounge band gone global, this 12-or-so-piece ensemble from Portland, Ore., follows a retro glamour jet stream from Rio to Havana to Paris. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $55. (Sisario) JILL SCOTT (Wednesday and Thursday) Jill Scott spills out words, spoken like hip-hop poetry or sung with jazzy timing, to detail the aspirations and loves of a sensual, intelligent and self-assured woman. The R&B crooner Musiq Soulchild opens on Wednesday; on Thursday the bill is shared by a vocal powerhouse, Chaka Khan, and a current pop hitmaker, Robin Thicke. Mo'Nique is the host of these two shows at Radio City Music Hall. At 8 p.m., (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $49.50 to $69.50 on Wednesday, sold out on Thursday. (Pareles) * STEELY DAN (Sunday, Monday and Wednesday) In 2000 Steely Dan released its first new songs in 20 years on ''Two Against Nature,'' and its members, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, crammed them full of musical subterfuges. The band once hated touring but has become quite proficient at it, especially now that Mr. Becker has accepted his inevitable role as lead guitarist. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Pareles) JOSS STONE, COMMON (Today) The self-reinvention pitch behind her third album says that Ms. Stone is over her early phase of imitating 1960s and '70s soul. But on ''Introducing Joss Stone'' (Virgin), this husky-voiced British 20-year-old still holds fast to retro sounds, this time a high-energy soul-funk tinged with hip-hop. Common, the socially conscious rapper from Chicago, will release his seventh album, ''Finding Forever,'' next month, but he's already on the campaign trail, comparing it to the work of Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye.

Opera 'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In its heyday on Bleecker Street, Amato Opera was where young New Yorkers saw their first operas; in its current home on the Bowery, it has taken on a certain quality of camp. But its loyal fans still love it, and it still loves opera, and offers Verdi with all of that love, so that some of the spirit of the opera comes across almost in spite of the variable skills of its performers.

At ''Boh\u00e8me'' on Tuesday, Gareth Morrell conducts Hei-Kyung Hong as Mim\u00ec, Mary Dunleavy as Musetta, Roberto Aronica as Rodolfo, Dwayne Croft as Marcello, Jeff Mattsey as Schaunard and Andrew Gangestad as Colline.

(Allan Kozinn) CONNECTICUT EARLY MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight and Sunday) This annual three-week feast of early music, slightly spare yet charming in the best New England tradition, begins this weekend with what you could call song and dance. Tonight the vocal trio Liber Unusualis performs mystical songs from the 14th and 15th centuries; on Sunday Vivaldi's complete ''Estro Armonico,'' a groundbreaking sequence of 12 concerti, will be performed in the original chamber instrumentation.

These seminal works are being performed alongside pieces by composers from Bach to Kaija Saariaho, whose ''Terra Memoria'' has been commissioned especially for this occasion. Sunday's program juxtaposes Beethoven's ''Harp'' and ''Serioso'' Quartets with works by Anton Webern and Bartok's teeming Third Quartet. The Emerson, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary with this series, sounded in top form for the first concert. The one drawback is Carnegie Hall, which for all its acoustical glory, is not an ideal space for an intimate string quartet experience. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $79. (Anthony Tommasini) * ENSEMBLE ACJW (Tomorrow) Earlier this year Carnegie Hall, the Weill Music Institute and the Juilliard School jointly instituted a visionary program to train outstanding young musicians on the verge of professional careers and integrate them into the music programs of selected New York City public schools. The emerging artists have been showcased this spring in several concerts at Carnegie Hall. The next one is tomorrow night, an exciting and ambitious program with large-scale works by Webern, Ligeti, Henri Dutilleux, Mauricio Kagel and John Adams (the Chamber Symphony). But the sponsors should strongly consider coming up with a better name for this talented roster of players. At 7 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org, $15. (Tommasini) MANNES BEETHOVEN INSTITUTE (Tonight) This weeklong program of instruction, lectures and concerts, which ends on Sunday, has been dealing mainly with Beethoven's chamber music.

They include Jennifer Higdon, Libby Larsen and Joan Tower, who has organized the whole festival as a way to promote discussion and, on a practical level, a new burst of ''old-girl'' networking. The first performance of a commissioned work by Kati Ag\u00f3cs is also on the program.

Scores by Philip Glass, Tania Le\u00f3n, William Bolcom, Robert Dennis, Matthew Harris, Eric Salzman, Gayla D. Morgan and one of the ensemble's singers, Elliot Z. Levine, are also included.

Completing the week's repertory are ''Three By Bach'' (Balanchine's ''Concerto Barocco,'' Christopher d'Amboise's ''Tribute'' and Jerome Robbins's ''Brandenburg''), tomorrow night; ''Essential Balanchine'' (''Walpurgisnacht Ballet,'' ''Liebeslieder Walzer'' and ''Symphony in Three Movements,'' on Sunday); the Balanchine classic ''Jewels'' (Tuesday and Thursday); and ''Balanchine and Robbins: Masters at Work'' (Balanchine's ''Raymonda Variations'' and ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto'' and Robbins's ''Dybbuk,'' on Wednesday. (Through June 24.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p. m. New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $86. (Dunning) NOCHE FLAMENCA (Tonight through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) It's back, with a new piece called ''Aldaba'' and the company star, Soledad Barrio, she of unfailing fire. (Through July 29.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 5 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 352-3101, theatremania.com; $55. (Dunning) JODY OBERFELDER DANCE PROJECTS (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Oberfelder, known for her acrobatic, high-energy dance mixed with glints of humor, will present her new ''Heavy Light,'' inspired by Horace Walpole's notion that life is a comedy for thinkers and a tragedy for those who feel, and ''The Title Comes Last,'' in which performers travel from a workaday world into ''a land of vibrancy.'' Take us with you. (Through June 17.) At 7 p.m., The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org; $20; $12 for students and 65+; $175 to $250 for the gala on Wednesday, including reception and postperformance dinner. (Dunning) Pascal Rioult Dance Theater (Tuesday through Thursday) The company celebrates its 15th anniversary with two premieres, including ''EXP#1,'' set to an electronic score, as well as the return of ''If by Chance'' and ''Black Diamond.'' (Through June 17.) Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Wednesday at 7 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $38. (La Rocco) SENS/NO\u00c9MIE LAFRANCE (Thursday) Ms. Lafrance, known for visually dramatic site-specific dance, will present performances of a work in progress called ''Rapture,'' in which dancers travel across stainless-steel roofs and walls in a response to the architectural design of Frank Gehry's Fisher Center. (Through June 16.) At 8 p.m., Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College, Annandale on the Hudson, N.Y., (575) 758-7900, fishercenter.bard.edu. (Dunning) STREB SLAM (Tonight through Sunday) High-flying, wall-crashing thrills and chills, and popcorn besides. (Through June 17.) Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 3 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Streb Laboratory for Action Mechanics, 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 352-3101, strebusa.org; $20; $10 for children. (Dunning) NINA WINTHROP AND DANCERS (Tonight through Sunday) Dancers will perform Ms. Winthrop's ''Constraints I, II & III.'' Each is a quartet, danced by women, that explores the expectations and pressures women face. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 3 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * brooklyn museum: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this assembly of pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn't venture beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Michael Kimmelman) * International Center of Photography: 'Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS:THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at C\u00e9zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener) * THE MET: 'Poiret: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) * El Museo del Barrio: 'The Disappeared (Los Desaparecidos),' through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'Richard Serra Sculpture: 40 Years,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in work he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman) THE NATIONAL ACADEMY: '182ND ANNUAL: AN EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY ART,' through July 24. The National Academy has mounted annual exhibitions showcasing living American artists (as opposed to dead Europeans) since it was founded in 1826. The annuals now alternate between invitationals, including nonmembers, and years devoted to academicians, professional artists elected by their peers to be members of the National Academy. This is a members-only year, which means that the work is more conservative -- or ''traditional,'' if you like. Heavily weighted toward painting, the exhibition includes lots of heirs to Abstract Expressionism and scores of competent figurative paintings and Expressionist- and Impressionist-inspired still lifes and landscapes. Among the participants are Philip Pearlstein, William Bailey, Will Barnet, Melvin Edwards, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Richard Estes and Lois Dodd. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: Matthew Brannon, 'Where Were We,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Summer of Love: Art of the PsychedElic Era,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown 'CONCEPTUAL PHOTOGRAPHY: 1964-1989' By now some of the freewheeling, sometimes prankish specimens of photography styled Conceptual, rampant in the '60s and '70s, have become classics, as this wide-ranging show proves. The more than 35 projects on view, drawn from a private collection, include works by many of the usual suspects: Vito Acconci, Bruce Nauman, Giuseppe Penone, John Baldessari and Charles Ray. Among those on display here that have stood the test of time are Nauman's witty explorations of his body, like ''Self-Portrait as Fountain'' (1966); Ray's ''Plank Piece I, II'' (1973), in which he helps a board make sculpture of his body; and Penone's ''To Reverse One's Eyes'' (1970), embellishing his sight through lenses made of mirrors. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, through June 23. (Glueck) 'CROSSCURRENTS: DURER TO PICASSO' A show of prints and drawings that makes imaginative pairings of older works with those of 20th-century artists who are sometimes cued by their contemporaries as well as their ancestors. The evidence is keen in, for example, Hieronymus Bosch's ''Temptation of St. Anthony'' (1561), a fervidly drawn scene of grotesque beings and fantastic doings placed near two later Surrealist renditions: a biomorphic figment by Andre Masson, ''The Genius of the Species'' (1942), and Salvador Dal\u00ed's etching ''Landscape in the Manner of Arcimboldo'' (1934), a biomorphic-geometric vision. A beguiling show. David Tunick, 19 East 66th Street, (212) 570-0090, through June 15. (Glueck) 'SUBLIME CONVERGENCE: GOTHIC TO THE ABSTRACT' This gathering of old master and contemporary paintings reminds us how the art of the past can resonate with that of the present. The emphasis is on the spiritual, with objects by a number of medieval gold-ground painters -- who covered panels with gold leaf to form a radiant background for their imagery -- dramatically displayed along with more recent art of a meditative nature. (Gregorian chant plays softly in the background.) One salient example is Taddeo di Bartolo's ''St. Francis of Assisi'' (about 1395), with its simple Gothic niche as background for the saint in his nuanced bluish-gray robe, accompanied by Brice Marden's ''Number 1'' (1963), another Minimalist composition of four gridded rectangles, each bluntly painted in a shade of gray, that seems to reflect the intensity of the earlier picture. Comparisons like this can go awry, but for the most part this show works. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through June 15. (Glueck) Galleries: 57th Street * PICASSO, BRAQUE AND EARLY FILM IN CUBISM Cubism and the first moving pictures emerged in the same decade. Coincidence? This thrilling exhibition doesn't think so. A dense display of major paintings, collages and prints; antique cameras and projectors; and snippets of film that Braque and Picasso are thought to have seen, it examines Cubism in the dim light and flickering images of the movie theater. It is radically reorienting to consider Cubism's fractured, revolving forms and transparencies as partly influenced by moving pictures. A few of the pictures even resemble movie cameras. Weirdest of all? Thinking of Analytical Cubism's pale, gleaming dabs of paint as dust motes caught in the projector's beam. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, through June 23. (Smith) Marc Quinn: 'Sphinx' This amusing, if somewhat disturbing, show presents Kate Moss as equal parts classical Greek sculpture, yoga devotee and SuperModel. It strikes a particularly contemporary chord in the way it addresses contemporary society's obsession with looking good and its confusion about how to get the inside (feelings, spirit, thoughts) to match the outside. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 752-2929, through June 30. (Bridget L. Goodbody) Galleries: SoHo TINA BARNEY: CHINA VISIT Tina Barney's last series of photographs featured a nearly extinct species, the European aristocracy, while her new works look to China. Most of the photographs feature members of the creative class, from actors and dancers to a jingle composer, although several juxtapose the ''old'' China with the ''new,'' Westernized version, seen through the filter of opera performers or female golf caddies posed against an urban backdrop. These are more posed and less intimate than Ms. Barney's photographs of her own upper-crust East Coast tribe, which made her famous in the 1980s. But the implications of this project are obvious, with China's growing position on the world's political and economic stages. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, between Prince and Spring Streets, SoHo, (212) 431-0166, www.janetbordeninc.com; through June 16. (Schwendener) Galleries: Other * MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: PREIS bilder Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, www.1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) Last Chance JOAQU\u00cdN TORRES-GARC\u00cdA: 'paintings and drawings, 1920-1942' This choice exhibition concentrates on small, lively ink drawings from the early 1930s, when Torres-Garc\u00eda ironed out Cubism into a compartmentalized grid that could either be abstract -- like Mondrian's work -- or a container for assorted symbols and hieroglyphs. Two earlier paintings underscore that, either way, his inspiration came from combined order and disorder of bustling city views. CDS Gallery, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' . This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Smith) YAYOI KUSAMA: FROM HERE TO INFINITY Spanning 50 years, this 24-piece overview is notable for its high quality and for unfamiliar works that sharpen the understanding of this artist's protean talent, among them several small, pungently colored folk-arty paintings that deploy her signature (and obsessive) webs, dots and scale patterns as effectively as her more abstract works do. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190; closes today. (Smith) MARGUERITE ZORACH: A LIFE IN ART The first solo show in more than 30 years of a pioneer of European modernism in America contains 35 paintings -- landscapes, portraits and still lifes -- ranging in date from 1910 to the mid-1960s. They're not all equally good, but they all have a quality of grit, intelligence and striving that never falters. The next show should also include her textiles and works on paper. Gerald Peters Gallery, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760, www.gpgallery.com; closes today.
