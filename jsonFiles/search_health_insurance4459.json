One is from history, of Southerners fighting against civil rights legislation or pacifists forestalling war, talking all day and night. The other is from the movie \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\" when Jimmy Stewart as Jefferson Smith held the floor trying nobly to expose corruption. Neither example bears much relationship to the current use of the filibuster. Refusing to agree to set a time for a vote has become a routine Republican tactic designed to defeat or dilute all kinds of bills of less than epoch-making importance, like the Family and Medical Leave Act or the National and Community Service Act. If the 44 Republican Senators are united, they can prevent the Democrats from assembling the 60 votes the rules now require to force a vote. Sometimes they even refuse to agree to a vote on a motion to start debating a bill. Using one parliamentary device or another, it is possible to filibuster one measure at least four times. Nor is there much theater to the filibuster any more. Round-the-clock sessions to tire out the angry minority and expose them to ridicule were a manageable tactic when a filibuster came only once every year or two. But they would exhaust the Senate today when filibusters come almost every week. Since the 1960's the Senate has fought filibusters by just having a series of votes to end debate, and doing other less controversial business in the meantime. That may change this summer. If Republicans refuse to agree to a vote on health care legislation, as some have threatened to do, round-the-clock sessions are likely. Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, will probably set up cots in the corridors and do everything he canto enable television to treat the Republicans as obstructionists. With the growing national sense that Congress is a waste of time and money even when it is working hard, that is a label many Republicans fear.
