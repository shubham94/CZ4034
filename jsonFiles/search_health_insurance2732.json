Ferrer was flanked by leading black figures, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, gadfly and provocateur. Suddenly the rivets began to pop on the mayor's smoothly machined schedule. The parade organizer bizarrely, but very insistently, demanded that Bloomberg march alongside his own challenger. The mayor, flushed, said, ''I'm here to march with my friends.'' Harlem is not friendly territory for a white Republican officeholder. Was there a racial subtext? It wasn't clear. The crowd grew denser and more turbulent, squeezing Bloomberg and his entourage to the edge of the street. ''Run, Freddy, run!'' came the cry from behind. The mayor, throttled, sidelined, stood with his arms crossed for five, six, seven minutes and said. . .nothing.
