Over the last five years, even as pregnancies among 15-to-19-year-olds have remained nearly steady, the rate among younger girls - some not even teen-agers -has risen. School officials offer a variety of reasons for the situation - the girls' desire for respite from a grim future, an ignorance of birth control and an unwillingness to postpone sex - but the officials remain perplexed as they try to keep their students' lives on course.

She became pregnant at age 13 and again a year later. The father of both children was a 15-year-old with whom she liked to hang around, and whom she hoped to persuade to marry her.
