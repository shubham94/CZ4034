Many attempts may prove worthless, but scientists deem further investigations warranted, and a sampling of disorders for which it has been tried follows: GOODPASTURE'S SYNDROME -Plasmapheresis, combined with immunosuppressive drug therapy, has been reported effective in this rare and often rapidly fatal condition. It is characterized by damage to the kidneys (glomerulonephritis) and bleeding in the lungs. The theory is that plasmapheresis removes a harmful antibody and substances called immune complexes. GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME -This unusual nervous system condition often follows viral infections or immunizations, and is characterized by muscle weakness that progresses upward in the body from the legs. Many patients recover spontaneously. But others develop respiratory paralysis, and some die. There are reports of speedier recoveries and remissions following plasmapheresis. Results of a more comprehensive study are due shortly.", "headline": {"main": "WHERE THE TECHNIQUE OF PLASMAPHERESIS HAS BEEN TRIED"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 631, "_id": "4fd11ee38eb7c8105d5ddf94", "snippet": "Plasmapheresis, a modern version of bloodletting, has been used to treat at least 50 ailments.

The human dose was based largely on the overall impressions that physicians derived from their everyday experience of treating patients as well as from extrapolations to humans of tests on animals. Now, however, an increasing number of more powerful and efficacious drugs are being marketed, and, with some of them, the range between an effective dosage and an unsafe one is narrower than it often was in the past. Accordingly, doctors have to pay far more attention to the dosage than they once did in writing each prescription.
