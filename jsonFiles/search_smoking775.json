It would upend the Government's longstanding position that tobacco is exempt from health regulation, and could open the way, at least in theory, to broad controls over cigarette production and sales, although the drug agency has confined itself for now to modest proposals on the politically surer ground of limiting young people's access.", "snippet": "The White House indicated today that it generally supported a landmark proposal by the Food and Drug Administration that nicotine in tobacco products be declared a drug and therefore subject to the agency's regulation.
