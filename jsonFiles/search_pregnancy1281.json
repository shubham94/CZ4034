By 1999, nearly one in four public school teachers said they taught about abstaining from sex until marriage as the only way to avoid pregnancy and disease, up from 1 in 50 in 1988. Abstinence courses tell youngsters to resist what they may feel are demands to give up their virginity, but the classes counter with their own brand of pressure, which celebrates chastity as proof of character. To the dismay of the nation's top health and H.I.V.-prevention experts, strict abstinence courses offer no advice for the half of all adolescents who are sexually active, except to deride contraception as unreliable.", "headline": {"main": "Word for Word/Saving Themselves; What Teenagers Talk About When They Talk About Chastity"}, "abstract": "Recent research shows that 15- and 16-year-olds who take voluntary chastity pledges under certain conditions avoid sex third longer than teenagers of similar backgrounds who make no such promise; results suggest that pledge offers teenagers way to separate themselves from their peers, affording them sense of identity on uncertain stretch of road to becoming adult; excerpted testimonials from Web site True Love Waits; sampling from stickers distributed by National Abstinence Clearinghouse, '25 Ways to Say No' (M)", "print_page": "7", "word_count": 1726, "_id": "4fd22de08eb7c8105d7bb98e", "snippet": "WHEN conservative Republicans in Congress tacked a last-minute amendment onto the Welfare Reform Bill in 1996, earmarking $250 million over five years to promote sexual abstinence outside of marriage, they ushered a movement from its traditional home...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/28/weekinreview/word-for-word-saving-themselves-what-teenagers-talk-about-when-they-talk-about.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL ABSTINENCE CLEARINGHOUSE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SEX"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Diana", "middlename": "Jean", "lastname": "SCHEMO", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2001-01-28T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Technology; Week in Review"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National Desk", "lead_paragraph": "While it has long been beyond debate that the government can make it a crime to possess or to distribute child pornography, a case the Supreme Court accepted today poses a new constitutional question for the computer age: whether the First Amendment permits criminalizing child pornography that depicts not actual children but computer-generated images that look like actual children.
