Bloomberg's volatile relationship with Randi Weingarten, the president of the teacher's union, seems to have soured again less than a month into the mayor's second term. Responding to a question on his weekly radio program, Mr. Bloomberg told listeners yesterday that Ms. Weingarten had criticized both of his major policy addresses of his new term. ''I think that she is 2 and 0,'' the mayor said. ''She was the only one that criticized my acceptance speech on Jan. 1, and the only one really to criticize this yesterday, so she's being consistent.'' Ms. Weingarten had complained that education was too far down on the list of priorities in his inaugural address. Then, after Mr. Bloomberg, in his annual address to the city on Thursday, called on the municipal unions to accept changes to health insurance and pension benefits to help tamp down rising costs, Ms. Weingarten took issue because, she said, he seemed to be signaling that health care premiums would be required, rather than negotiated, in future contract negotiations. ''I'm surprised that he took my comments so personally,'' Ms. Weingarten said yesterday.

The circumstance of this victory by insurance lobbyists is particularly relevant now that the same Congressional leaders are feverishly vowing to enact lobbying reform. The bill change, dearly sought by the H.M.O. industry, was written by House and Senate lawmakers and staff members in closed-door, Republican-only bargaining sessions -- one of the ''conference committees'' for settling differences in final legislation that are themselves becoming part of the Capitol's influence-peddling scandal.
