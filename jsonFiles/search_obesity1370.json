Mark Troupin, 15, who lost 30 pounds last summer, recalled: ''Every night I'd go to bed saying to myself, 'This time I'm going on a diet.' Nothing ever lasted more than 48 hours. But at camp I relearned my eating habits, and it worked.'' The popularity of weight camps for children and adults has grown over the years, and if any stigma was ever attached to such camps, it has faded as the importance of self-image has become increasingly recognized as integral to a child's development.
