Strawberry, the New York Mets' slugging right fielder, had spent what would probably be his last winter of innocence. Swaddled by family and the familiar routines of life at home, he had passed his days in a pleasant combination of work and play: lifting weights at a local health club, taking some cuts in the batting cage at a neighborhood park, enjoying an evening with old friends at a college basketball game. The sideshow had not yet begun, and his days were his own this singular winter.

The shedder of tears is likely to apologize, even when a devastating tragedy was the provocation. The observer of tears is likely to do everything possible to put an end to the emotional outpouring. But judging from recent studies of crying behavior, links between illness and crying and the chemical composition of tears, both those responses to tears are often inappropriate and may even be counterproductive. People are the only animals definitely known to shed emotional tears.
