Some of the areas in which they disagree were explored last week when Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican-Conservative incumbent, and Ogden R. Reid, the Democrat-Liberal, met in a 90-minute debate at The New York Times. Although Mr. O'Rourke said that the difference between him and his opponent ''is one of great substance,'' there were also topics on which the two agreed, among them the need for more affordable housing, the necessity for additional monitoring of air and water quality and the belief that county government had functioned effectively under the two previous administrations. Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. Reid disagreed, however, on the county's future needs and whether low-cost electrical power was now available for Westchester residents and industry. Mr. Reid has offered a plan that he said would bring low-cost electrical power to Westchester residents and industry as soon as next year. According to the former four-term Congressman, the power is now available from Canadian sources and could be obtained through negotiations with the aid of the New York Power Authority.", "headline": {"main": "O'ROURKE AND REID OUTLINE VIEWS ON WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 5690, "_id": "4fd12ffe8eb7c8105d5fcad5", "snippet": "WITH the campaign for County Executive drawing to a close, the two major candidates have been outlining their positions on a wide range of issues, including housing, the environment and county government.
