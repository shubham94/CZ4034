Reilly, Paul Rudd, Andy Samberg, Molly Shannon and Ben Stiller. ''Before Will a man in his boxers was considered funny,'' Mr. O'Brien said, explaining Mr. Ferrell's appeal. ''But sometime in the '90s Will raised the bar and appeared in tight, unflattering briefs. It was a paradigm shift, a cosmic break, and comedy has never been the same.'' 1 A.M.

In a world where the Colts lose by 55 points, the Jaguars can beat the Ravens without scoring a touchdown and games are becoming so boring that they have become upstaged by the postgame handshakes, it is heartening to know that we can still count on the Steelers' defense. Unfortunately, we cannot still count on the Steelers' defense. The Steelers have intercepted just two passes this season, an amazingly low figure when you run down the quarterbacks they have faced: Tarvaris Jackson, Blaine Gabbert, Kevin Kolb, Kerry Collins, Curtis Painter. Ten of the Steelers' 17 sacks came against Gabbert and Jackson, the standard-bearers in that cavalcade of regret. While Warren Sapp's ''old and slow'' estimation of the Steelers' defense after Week 1 was premature and slightly exaggerated, the Steel Curtain now has a higher-than-advertised aluminum content. The Steelers compensate for their declining defense with one of the best passing attacks in the league: they rank fifth in net passing yards per game and eighth in yards per attempt. And while the Patriots' offense is better than Pittsburgh's, their defense is far worse, allowing a league-high 423 yards per game. So get ready for a back-and-forth, high-scoring offensive battle. After last week's games, you deserve it.
