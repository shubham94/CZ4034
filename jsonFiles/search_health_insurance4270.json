The most startling figure in the employment data was the 9,000 decline in payroll jobs. And for the second straight month, the number of factory jobs declined. Analysts regarded the numbers as the most definitive in a series of reports showing a sharp deceleration of the economy. Indeed, fears are being raised that the Fed's anti-inflation campaign may have been overly severe. Page 1. The unemployment rate in New York State increased to 6.8 percent and rose to 6.3 percent in New Jersey. In New York City, the rate was up slightly, to 8.6 percent. 38. U.S. and Japan Break Off Talks on Automotive Trade The United States and Japan said talks over trade in automobiles and auto parts had ended in failure. The Clinton Administration plans to decide what kinds of trade sanctions to impose on billions of dollars in Japanese goods imported into the United States. 1. Drive for Legal Overhaul Is Trimmed Senate Republicans scaled back their effort to limit damage awards in liability suits, hoping to attract enough votes for passage on Monday. The revised proposal would extend the damage cap in product liability suits but only to cases against businesses or government entities with fewer than 25 full-time employees. The revised measure would not cap punitive damages in medical malpractice cases. 10. Dow Falls 16 on Jobs Report The Dow industrials declined in a second day of erratic trading, falling 16.26, to 4,343.40, as the decline in new jobs, the first in more than two years, raised the prospect that corporate earnings would slump. 39. A rally in the bond market helped the dollar gain slightly against the major currencies. The dollar rose to 1.3730 German marks from 1.3710 marks on Thursday and edged up to 83.96 yen, from 83.80. 34. Group in Bid for Grace Unit An investment group of former W. R. Grace executives is teaming up with Constantine Hampers in his $3.5 billion bid to buy National Medical Care, W. R. Grace's health care subsidiary. The group, called Quad-C, is based in Charlottesville, Va., and is headed by Terrence Daniels, a former Grace vice chairman who led the acquisition of National Medical Care in 1984. 37. New York Fines Prudential Prudential Insurance has agreed to pay a $5 million fine for disregarding rules requiring that agents and the policy forms they use be approved by New York State. It was the biggest fine ever levied by the New York Insurance Department, but the department said there was little effect on consumers. 38. Trump and Pritzker Settle Feud Donald Trump, left, and Jay Pritzker have settled their long-running legal feud over the management of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York, which they jointly own and which the Pritzker family's Hyatt Corporation manages. People familiar with documents signed by both sides this week said the settlement cleared the way for renovations at the convention hotel near Grand Central Terminal. Mr. Pritzker said he hoped that work on the hotel \"could begin soon.\" 37. Borrowing by Consumers Increases Consumer borrowing accelerated during March at the fastest pace since last summer. Led by a $6.7 billion increase in credit card use, installment borrowing rose 17.9 percent, to $13.8 billion. In February, consumer credit rose a revised $7.7 billion. 38. Nintendo Delays New Game Machine Nintendo of America confirmed that its Ultra 64 video game player would not be ready in time for Christmas. The company said it would unveil the machine in November, but not introduce it until April 1996. Analysts said the delay could hurt competitors nearly as much as it did Nintendo, because consumers may put off buying any machine until the Ultra 64 becomes available. 34.", "headline": {"main": "BUSINESS DIGEST"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "35", "word_count": 663, "_id": "4fd1e96b8eb7c8105d737a44", "snippet": "Unemployment Rate Jumps As Number of Jobs Falls The nation's unemployment rate jumped three-tenths of a point, to 5.8 percent, in April and the number of new jobs fell for the first time in more than two years, as the slowdown in the economy spread...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/06/business/business-digest-717295.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "NO INDEX TERMS"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1995-05-06T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Business"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Very little has rattled Republican leaders since they took control of Congress four months ago, but their anxiety in recent days has been almost palpable.
