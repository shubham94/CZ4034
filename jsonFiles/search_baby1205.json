Bowen to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, asserting he had not been a consistent opponent of abortion. In addition, Dr. Bowen faces scrutiny from Congress because of statements he made recently suggesting that Medicare would save money and elderly people with terminal illnesses would suffer less if they could more easily order a halt to medical efforts to prolong their lives. Critics of Dr. Bowen said he had, in effect, advocated steps that could lead to euthanasia. Aides to Dr. Bowen said he would not respond to the criticism until he testified before the Senate Finance Committee at his confirmation hearing, probably later this year. The committee has jurisdiction over many of the programs of the Department of Health and Human Services.", "headline": {"main": "GROUPS OPPOSE CABINET CHOICE OVER ABORTIONS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 824, "_id": "4fd148da8eb7c8105d6257f5", "snippet": "Anti-abortion groups and several conservative organizations said today they would oppose the nomination of Dr. Otis R.
