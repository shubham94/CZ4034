Things were going fine as long as the economy was growing steadily and slowly. But suddenly in the middle of last week the growth seemed perkier, and the alarms went off. Interest rates, which had been dozing way down below 6 percent, headed straight up, and investors suddenly remembered that there was life -- and possibly better returns -- beyond stocks. Or, the way these things work, they figured everyone else would think that way. In any case, the Dow industrials, after notching new records early in the week, did an about-face, losing 73 points in two days. The Dow steadied on Friday, but most of the market kept retreating. And it was a busy week, with Big Board volume the second-highest ever. The only busier week?
