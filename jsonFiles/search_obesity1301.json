Are those 5, 10, even 25 extra pounds you're lugging around really damaging your health or just marring your self-image? If you have lived for years on ''the rhythm method of girth control,'' as Dr. Jean Mayer has so aptly put it, does it make any sense to try yet again to lose weight in the hope that this time you will succeed in keeping it off? A Federal panel of health experts who grappled with these questions earlier this month came up with some answers, although controversy abounds. The answers, it seems, depend on who you are and why you ask. Aside from obvious considerations, such as whether you are professionally obliged to be pencil thin, factors like your personal and family medical history and your social comfort can figure importantly in the answers. Also important is whether your goal is to live as long as possible or to be healthy for as long as you live. Counter to logic, statistics indicate that these goals - longevity and good health - do not necessarily go together, at least not when weight is the primary influencing factor. According to recently issued insurance company data, it appears that weighing somewhat more than the old height-weight charts said you should may keep you alive longer, but it won't necessarily keep you healthy.", "snippet": "HOW much should you weigh?
