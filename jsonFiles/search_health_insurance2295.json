[Page C1.] LOOKING FOR A BIG HIT -- Perella Weinberg Partners may be just a year and a half old as an investment bank, but can it deliver the headline-grabbing, blockbuster mergers that made a name for its founder, Joseph R. Perella? [C1.] SOLD ON EBAY, SHIPPED VIA AMAZON -- Amazon.com is expanding a program that allows independent sellers -- even vendors who sell through Amazon's e-commerce rival, eBay -- to use its network of distribution centers to store and ship their products. [C1.] A NEW KIND OF BUYOUT -- An $8 billion bid by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Goldman Sachs for Harman International Industries, the maker of JBL speakers, has a potentially groundbreaking twist: The buyers have offered Harman shareholders a chance to retain a stake in the company, and share in any profit made if the company is later sold or taken public again. [C1.] STRONG QUARTER FOR MICROSOFT -- Microsoft reported quarterly sales and profits that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, suggesting that early sales of its new Windows Vista operating system were off to a solid start. [C3.] RISING PROFIT AT EXXON MOBIL -- Exxon Mobil reported another surge in profits for the first quarter of the year because of stronger earnings from its refining, marketing and chemicals businesses. The results -- Exxon said they were its best ever for any first quarter -- were particularly noteworthy given the mixed earnings picture reported in recent days by other large oil companies. [C4.] BETTER CHANCES FOR TRADE BILL -- Prospects have suddenly improved for bipartisan agreement on trade legislation in Congress, thanks in part to a talk between President Bush and Representative Charles B. Rangel, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

[C2.] PUBLIC CONCERNED OVER WARMING -- Americans in large bipartisan numbers say the heating of the earth's atmosphere is having serious effects on the environment now or will soon and think that it is necessary to take immediate steps to reduce its effects, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. [A20.] EMI'S NORTH AMERICAN UNIT -- EMI Group, the struggling British music giant, has hired the longtime industry executive Roger Ames, a former chairman of Warner Music Group, to revive its North American operation. The appointment of Mr. Ames, left, comes more than three months after a management shake-up in which EMI ousted the two senior executives overseeing its recorded music operation. [C7.] A MODEL OF CONSISTENCY, ONCE -- For 25 years, Absolut vodka ran a humorous campaign celebrating its distinctive bottle, and became renowned for the consistency of its pitches to consumers. Now the brand is changing advertising approaches for the second time in 15 months. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C3.] MORE SUSPECTED BRIBES AT SIEMENS -- A day after the chief executive of Siemens announced he would step down, the company warned that it expected to report a ''significant increase'' in the number of possible bribes identified in an internal investigation. [C7.] MYSPACE.COM HEADING TO CHINA -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is taking MySpace.com to China, a latecomer to China's crowded field of online social networking sites that is betting it can overcome that handicap by competing unconventionally as a start-up. [C7.] CANADIAN RULES ON EMISSIONS -- Canadian industries must cut the rate at which they produce gases linked to global warming by 18 percent over the next three years, the federal government said. [C7.] PROFIT NEWS HAS LITTLE IMPACT -- Stocks ended mixed as strong profit reports from companies like Apple Inc. and 3M failed to galvanize Wall Street. Still, a modest advance gave the Dow Jones industrial average another record close. [C9.] ONLINE Business Briefing Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business. The US Airways Group reported that profit edged up 2 percent in the first quarter on modest revenue growth, and repeated its forecast for a profitable year. (AP) The health insurer Aetna reported an 8 percent increase in first-quarter profits, pointing to membership growth as proof that consumer marketing applied to health insurance is working. (AP) The 3M Company, considered a bellwether for the economy, posted a far better-than-expected quarterly profit, sending its shares up. (REUTERS) Coca-Cola Enterprises reported a 6 percent decline in earnings but beat Wall Street estimates, helped by the introduction of Coke Zero in Europe and raw material costs that rose less than expected. (REUTERS) The Belo Corporation, publisher of The Dallas Morning News, reported a drop in quarterly profit and revenue because of decreasing sales of classified and other advertising.
