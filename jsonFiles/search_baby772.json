She's been solicitous about jet lag. She has gone out into her woolly desert garden, plucked giant cucumbers and bright purple eggplants and cooked up a delicious meal. But when I ask about her childhood, she says, ''I'm not crazy about myself,'' and emits a low, edgy chuckle. Kingsolver, you see, doesn't want to be just another late-20th-century image for sale. She's no performer, and the history of her psyche is not in the public domain. When I suggest that Dickens, Twain and Wilde all happily embraced fame, she counters: ''Well, they weren't raising kids. And Oscar Wilde was never shoved onto the noontime news in Denver and a mike clipped to his lapel and asked, 'In 58 seconds, because that's what we have, what did you mean when you wrote ''The Importance of Being Earnest?''
