It's our first. It's unlike anything normal just to watch her body change. I don't think it was what I expected. We were going to have a home birth, and having to move kind of threw that off. We were under a sublease, and the girl who owned the floor that our loft was on sold it. So we had to leave, too. It was really crazy. I didn't get stressed out by it though. I don't know, I'm just wired like that. But this, this was not normal -- everything happened at once.''", "headline": {"main": "What They Were Thinking", "kicker": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 3-31-02"}, "abstract": "wA", "print_page": "22", "word_count": 338, "_id": "4fd273248eb7c8105d8303b9", "snippet": "James Lanning and Rain Lanning, Brooklyn, Jan. 13, 2002    James: ''I was sitting in our living room.

She translates her ideas -- sometimes half-baked -- into raw drawings with such ease and fluency that her art seems to say conversationally, ''Hey, let me show you this.'' But ingratiating it isn't. Her exhibition at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Name No Names,'' was organized by the Pompidou Center in Paris. It surveys her art from 1970 to now, presenting more than 80 works on paper. The title is doubly clever, serving as an injunction not to make political betrayals and aptly describing her own no-label approach to art and life.", "headline": {"main": "Capturing Humanity, Rough and Unrefined", "kicker": "ART REVIEW"}, "abstract": "Grace Glueck reviews works by South African artist Marlene Dumas at New Museum of Contemporary Art; photo (M)", "print_page": "38", "word_count": 977, "_id": "4fd26da38eb7c8105d827155", "snippet": "Marlene Dumas, a white South African artist now living in Amsterdam, touches visually on many issues important to the Modern Psyche: gender, identity, power, politics, love, sex, babies, machismo and racial inequality, although not necessarily in...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/29/arts/art-review-capturing-humanity-rough-and-unrefined.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "DUMAS, MARLENE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Grace", "lastname": "GLUECK"}], "original": "By GRACE GLUECK"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2002-03-29T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts"}], "meta": {"hits": 2, "offset": 0, "time": 23}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
