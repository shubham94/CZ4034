Siegel, has shaped the Pielmeier drama so that the weaknesses inherent in the script are smoothed over and the play's strengths are as fully realized as in the original Broadway production.", "headline": {"main": "A THOUGHT-PROVOKING 'AGNES OF GOD'", "kicker": "THEATER REVIEW"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "29", "word_count": 615, "_id": "4fd13fd88eb7c8105d616ffb", "snippet": "JOHN PIELMEIER'S philosophical drama, ''Agnes of God,'' was a long-running hit on Broadway.
