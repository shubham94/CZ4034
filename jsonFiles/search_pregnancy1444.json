She arrives for her appointment promptly at 10 A.M., neatly dressed in pressed jeans and loafers, but her voice is shaking a little when she signs in at the front desk and her shoulders stay hunched, in what might be shyness or self-protection. She follows the nurse-practitioner into the examining room and lies down without being asked. During the exam, she winces and cries, making hardly a sound. But afterward, sitting up, her fingers laced together in her lap, she is almost talkative. ''Did you think about maybe keeping the baby or giving it up for adoption?'' the nurse-practitioner asks kindly. ''Yes,'' says the young woman, ''but I knew I didn't want to do that. My parents are having all kinds of financial difficulties. I know they'd want me to finish school.'' Besides, she says, her voice a little stronger now, though her sentences still end in that questioning upward lilt of late adolescence, ''I want to finish school. I don't want to work in a 7-Eleven all my life.'' And, after a long pause: ''I want to have kids someday, but I want to be able to take care of them so they won't be miserable.'' When the nurse asks if she has been using birth control, she says yes, she's on the pill, but she doesn't take it all that regularly. ''My boyfriend and I want to try that injection -- Depo-Provera? -- 'cause the pill makes me sick.'' So far, there is nothing especially unusual about the young woman's story. What is unusual is the kind of abortion she will have today. For quite personal reasons, she has opted for a new method with enormous political consequences. At 10:30 A.M., she sits down with a counselor, a chatty ex-schoolteacher, to hear about the procedure she is about to undertake as part of a clinical trial. Then a nurse guides her into another room, points her to the only chair and gives her a cup of water and a tablet of mifepristone -- better known as RU-486, or the French abortion pill. ''Here goes!'' the young woman says. She knows there is no turning back once she takes the pill. It will begin to work right away, blocking the effects of her body's progesterone, a hormone needed for the fertilized egg to sustain itself in the wall of her uterus.", "headline": {"main": "The Little White Bombshell"}, "abstract": "Margaret Talbott article on clinical US trials of mifepristone--better known as RU-486, the French abortion pill, which Danco Group plans to manufacture and market for general public by the end of 1999; says pill may well reconfigure the politics and perception of abortion in America, increasing the number of doctors willing to perform abortions, making it much harder for anti-abortion activitists to harass doctors and patients, increasing the frequency of early abortions and thus making abortion more socially acceptable; photos (L)", "print_page": "39", "word_count": 7593, "_id": "4fd221748eb7c8105d7a6310", "snippet": "The woman waiting for her abortion is 20 years old, a college student, wan and pretty, with long black hair and glasses.
