Recently, he retired from private practice and dedicated his time and skill as an obgyn at The Family Birthing Center at St. Vincent's Hospital in Bridgeport. Howard's dedicated and successful career gained him paramount respect as a leader in his field. Additionally, he was a recognized author who published numerous books related to women's health. Amongst his popular publications were ''The Birth Control Book'' and ''The Pregnancy Book for Today's Woman.'' He was a relentless advocate of a woman's right to choose. Howard's passion for his profession and his zest for life were unparalleled. He was a man of the utmost integrity and conviction. His intelligence, charm, and sincerity were a gift to all who were blessed to know him. He possessed a wonderfully unique sense of humor that brought light and laughter to all. Howard was a ranked tennis player who competed passionately on the USTA New England circuit. He was also an avid reader, fisherman, dog lover and master of vocabulary. In the spring of 1999, Howard was blessed to have found his love and inspiration, Maria. A warm, caring and devoted husband, father, grandfather, and friend, Howard leaves behind his wife Maria, his two daughters Suzanne and Marjorie, his granddaughter Madeline, and his stepchildren Lauren, Kristen and Matthew. Howard had a long and beautiful former marriage to the late Bette Shapiro. Services will be held Monday, October 18, 2004, at 1 PM, from The Abraham L.
