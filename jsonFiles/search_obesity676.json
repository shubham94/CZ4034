Newman doesn't like the use of heart-rending stories to sway medical decision makers. He prefers statistical proof, the cold calculus of numbers. But in trying to explain why testing children's cholesterol rarely makes sense -- a contention strongly disputed by many leading medical societies and government health agencies -- even he cannot help stooping to a story. ''I have a friend whose teenage son had his cholesterol measured,'' said Dr. Newman, a pediatrician and professor in the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco. ''He was on the swim team and the track team, and he ate a very healthy diet.

More people have jobs and health insurance when an economy is growing. Fewer people skip visits to the doctor to save money or suffer the severe stress that comes with a layoff. So with job growth now stronger than it has been since 2000, the country can look forward to some vigorous years, it might seem. But that is not quite how the world works, some new research has found. In fact, a strong economy should probably come with a warning label. A one-percentage-point fall in the unemployment rate -- which is what has happened since the summer of 2003 -- leads to 12,000 deaths a year in the United States that might not otherwise have happened, according to Christopher J.
