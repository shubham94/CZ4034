The remarks of the adviser, Dr. Walter F. Riker Jr. of the Cornell University Medical College, were included in a letter written to Jan Van Duser, the N.F.L.'s Director of Operations. The league had asked Dr. Riker for his reaction to a recent article in Sports Illustrated magazine, ''The Steroid Predicament,'' in which Dr. Terry Todd, a former weight lifter and currently a professor in the physical education department at the University of Texas at Austin, discussed the effects of steroid use by amateur athletes. Dr. Riker's observation that many N.F.L. players are using anabolic (body-building) steroids was supported by several players. ''Sure, it's being done,'' said Jeff Van Note, the center of the Atlanta Falcons and the president of the N.F.L. Players Association.
