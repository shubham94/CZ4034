Fat is the nutrient most commonly overconsumed and least likely to be compensated for by eating less at subsequent meals or by exercising the calories away. And while holiday treats like cookies, pies, cakes, eggnog and chocolates are certainly sweet, their main source of calories by far is fat.", "snippet": "YOU may think it is the sweetness of holiday treats that prompts you to shovel in the thousands of tongue-tickling calories that show up as extra padding by year's end.

A fat baby was said to be beautiful and healthy-looking. My parents and grandmother spent my skin-and-bones childhood years trying to fatten me up, stuffing me with sticks of butter, bars of Velveeta cheese and cans of evaporated milk. (The effort failed, incidentally, until adolescent hormones took over.) In the last few years, however, the country has gone hog wild over low-fat, nonfat and fat-free foods. Supermarket shelves groan with cakes, cookies, chips, dips, cheese, sausage and that quintessential no-no, ice cream, minus most or all of the fat. People think that by avoiding fat they will automatically shed pounds. But many who once ate sparingly of such foods now indulge freely in their low-fat or nonfat versions, sometimes downing servings two or three times as large as those they would eat of the full-fat food. As a result, many Americans desperate to shrink their widening girth are getting fatter still on fat-free foods and little or no exercise.", "snippet": "FAT.
