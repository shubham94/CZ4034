Solidifying the mother-infant bond in the first hours and days of life was said to improve mothering, increase the likelihood of breast feeding, enhance child development and prevent child abuse and neglect. Now, however, the very existence of this ''sensitive'' period when mothers are supposedly best able to become emotionally attached to their babies is being challenged by a number of researchers, who cite flaws in the supporting studies. The critics say that if early contact affects how well a mother cares for her baby, the effect small and limited to some mothers under some circumstances. The controversy points to a number of problems inherent in the study of human behavior, among them the difficulty of establishing tight scientific controls and of measuring and interpreting human responses. The debate also emphasizes the human propensity to accept suggestive research findings as definitive if they mesh with preconceived notions.", "headline": {"main": "INFLUENTIAL THEORY ON 'BONDING' AT BIRTH IS NOW QUESTIONED"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1421, "_id": "4fd143f28eb7c8105d61d82e", "snippet": "THE widespread concept that there is a special period right after birth during which mothers become ''bonded'' to their infants has prompted many hospitals to allow, even encourage, mothers and fathers to have immediate and prolonged contact with...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/29/science/influential-theory-on-bonding-at-birth-is-now-questioned.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BABIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOSPITALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FAMILIES AND FAMILY LIFE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIRTHS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Jane", "middlename": "E.", "lastname": "BRODY", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By JANE E.
