The recommendations cover two new vaccines for teenagers: one for the virus that causes cervical cancer and the other for a bacterium that causes meningitis and other diseases. The agency has updated its recommended list of vaccines several times over the past 15 years, always after lengthy debate. Each state, rather than the C.D.C., decides which vaccines to make compulsory for entry into school. And some new vaccines are recommended rather than required because their prices are so high. The timing of injections is complex, and must be overseen by a doctor. But in general, these are the recommendations: By age 6 Polio Measles Mumps Rubella Chickenpox Diphtheria Tetanus Whooping cough Hib (meningitis) PCV (pneumonia) Rotavirus (diarrhea) Hepatitis A and B Flu (annually) By age 18 Cervical cancer* (Caused by human papillomavirus) Meningococcus (bacterial infection) From 18-65 Between ages 18-65, the vaccination you should get depends on risk factors Flu (annually when available, always after age 50) Tetanus and diphtheria (every 10 years) Measles, mumps, rubella, chicken-pox (for everyone not previously infected) Some high-risk categories: MULTIPLE DISEASES: Military recruits, health care workers, emergency responders, sewer workers HEPATITIS: Gay men, sex workers, drug injectors PLAGUE, RABIES: Veterinarians, animal handlers ANTHRAX: Hide handlers BY REGION: Travelers and immigrants may need vaccination, depending on their location.
