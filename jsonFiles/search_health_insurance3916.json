''There are some differences from last year because of changes in the law,'' said Avery E. Neumark, a principal at the New York accounting firm Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin & Company, ''as well as traditional year-end moves.'' His checklist includes these strategies: SECURITIES TRADES -- After last year's ultracomplex rules on holding periods for long-term capital gains and losses, Congress has simplified the rules, defining long term as anything held over 12 months. Such capital gains will have a 20 percent tax rate for most taxpayers; up to $3,000 of net capital losses can be taken against ordinary income. While the Dow industrials have recovered in recent weeks, many investors still have paper losses in emerging-markets funds, for example. If you are among them and want to reposition that holding, recognizing the loss in December could cut your taxes. If the loss is more than $3,000, the excess can be carried forward to a future year. KEOGH PLANS -- Anyone with self-employment income -- even from a sideline like part-time consulting -- can put part of that money into a tax-deferred Keogh retirement plan, provided that the plan is set up by Dec. 31. The money does not have to be deposited until the due date of the return, April 15 -- or later, with an extension. CHARITABLE GIFTS -- If you donate appreciated securities instead of cash, you can deduct the market value and owe no capital-gains tax. If you are short of cash now, you can take a 1998 deduction if the charity charges the donation to a credit card in December. STATE AND LOCAL TAX BILLS -- For most taxpayers, paying real estate or fourth-quarter estimated state and local taxes in December will mean a bigger 1998 deduction. But if you are subject to the alternative minimum tax, you will lose the deduction, so then it may be worth postponing any payments until January. ESTIMATED TAXES -- The 1998 rules are not as tough as last year's, but you should still do some math to make sure you do not face an underpayment penalty. You will escape the penalty if your estimated tax payments come within $1,000 of what is due, or if you have paid 90 percent of the current year's liability in 1998 or an amount equal to 100 percent of your 1997 liability. HEALTH INSURANCE -- The allowed deduction for self-employed people has risen to 45 percent of health insurance premiums paid for 1998. That gives the self-employed a bigger incentive to buy coverage. FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS -- This employer-provided benefit reimburses expenditures for certain child-care and medical costs, tax-free. But it is a ''use it or lose it'' benefit, so you should tap any unused funds this month. GIFTS -- An individual may make annual gifts of as much as $10,000 to any number of people, with no reduction of the unified gift and estate tax credit. Wealthy people may want to consider making gifts before Dec. 31 to cut the size of their taxable estates. JAN M.
