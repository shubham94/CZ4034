Now John Cassidy, The New Yorker's financial writer, has delivered an impressive two-part contribution to the genre. Cassidy supports the health care bill on moral grounds, but he has deep doubts about its fiscal sustainability. On this front, he makes two points that many right-of-center wonks have been hammering on for a while now. First, the individual mandate is \"a bit of a sham,\" and lots and lots of people will probably just pay the modest fine (or dodge it) until they get sick, at which point they'll show up demanding their guaranteed insurance policy, sending costs skyrocketing. Second, the subsidies for the individual market are so much more generous than the existing tax deduction for employer-provided health care that employers will have an enormous incentive to offload their employees onto the new exchanges:", "headline": {"main": "The Heresies of John Cassidy", "kicker": "Ross Douthat"}, "abstract": "What The New Yorker's financial writer doesn't like about
