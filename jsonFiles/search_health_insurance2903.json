With all due respect to God, it may be even more than that. The impression of Odessa that emerges from Peter Berg's new film, and from the scrupulously reported 1990 book by H. G. Bissinger on which it is based, is of a self-contained world in which high school football, played in a stadium bigger than ones at many colleges, is more important than church, state, sex, money or anything else. The sport's power is sacred and secular: it holds the social order together and gives individual lives a sense of meaning and high purpose. Early in the movie the teenage boys who play for Permian High School are told that their duty is ''to protect this town'' -- a job description that somehow doesn't seem metaphorical. Odessa during football season resembles a besieged garrison, and these kids are its soldiers.
