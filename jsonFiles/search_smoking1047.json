Weinberger to end the sale of cut-rate cigarettes in military commissaries and exchanges as a health measure, Pentagon officials said today. The officials, speaking on the condition they not be named, said that Dr. William E. Mayer, Assistant Secretary of Defense for health affairs, had sent Mr. Weinberger a proposed directive that included an end to the military subsidy on cigarettes, and that Chapman B. Cox, who recently became Assistant Secretary for manpower, had endorsed it. Mr. Weinberger has not indicated whether he will sign the directive. But appearing on a television call-in program Monday, he said the Pentagon was ''looking at a number of ways in which we're trying our best to discourage smoking by the troops'' because ''it makes us less ready, and impairs our abiliity to do the missions we may have to do sometime.''", "snippet": "The senior Pentagon officials in charge of manpower and health affairs have urged Defense Secretary Caspar W.
