Behind the News -- The sneakers allow children (or adults) to go from walking to rolling by shifting their weight to their heels. It's not always smooth sliding. Broken ankles, arms, feet, a concussion and possibly even one death have resulted,reported the commission, which recommends wearing helmets and knee and elbow pads with the sneakers -- just what a child wants to hear. Heelys, one of the manufacturers, has shipped more than 10 million worldwide. The company says they are much safer than biking, skateboarding or even tennis. 'A SILENT EPIDEMIC' The News -- Accidental deaths rose by more than 20 percent over 10 years ending in 2005, according to a study by the National Safety Council. Behind the News -- Accidents caused 113,000 deaths in 2005, the council said, approaching the high of 116,385 in 1969. Motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause of death and injury, followed by poisonings (including overdoses of prescription, over-the-counter and illegal drugs), falls, choking and drowning. For people up to age 41, accidents were the top cause of death, and ranked fifth in the nation over all, exceeded by heart disease, cancer, stroke and respiratory diseases. ''A silent epidemic,'' the council's president, Alan McMillan, said. LOCK AND UNLOAD The News -- About two-thirds of parents who keep a gun at home fail to store them safely, according to a study published in the medical journal Pediatrics. Behind the News -- More than 3,700 parents in 45 states, Canada and Puerto Rico were interviewed when they brought their children, ages 2 to 11, to their pediatrician for a visit. Twenty-three percent said they owned a firearm, but only one-third said that they stored their guns safely by keeping them in a locked cabinet or safe with gunlocks secured and ammunition stored separately. To the researchers, the numbers suggested that pediatricians should ask parents if guns are present in their homes and offer advice on how to store them safely. READ THE LABEL The News -- The Food and Drug Administration asked two drug makers to place prominent warnings on their diabetes medicine because they may pose increased risks of heart problems. Behind the News -- The agency's safety reviewers urged such a step last year. But F.D.A. officials didn't act until a leading medical journal reported last month that one of the drugs, Avandia, significantly increased the risk of heart attacks. Actos, the other drug, also may pose heart risks. Both treat Type 2 diabetes. The agency's commissioner, Andrew C. von Eschenbach, said he acted because ''despite existing warnings, these drugs were being prescribed to patients with significant heart failure.'' WIIOOPS The News -- A Spanish doctor, Julio Bonis, diagnosed a new medical condition after a patient complained of shoulder pain following a vigorous bout of tennis on his Wii. Behind the News -- A popular Nintendo video game console, Wii lets players punch or swing a wireless wand that translates their motions onto a television screen. There's golf, boxing, bowling, baseball, etc. The games can be quite a workout, and errant wands have caused bruises, broken windows and smashed TV screens. Now comes ''Wiitis,'' the intense shoulder pain described by Dr. Bonis in a letter last week to a leading medical journal. He prescribed ibuprofen and abstinence from the Wii.
