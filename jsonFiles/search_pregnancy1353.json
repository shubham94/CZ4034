Then big George Foreman's daughter Freeda announced her own pugilistic intentions. Women's boxing, which has struggled in the shadow of the men's sport, is coming into its own. The estimated 300 professional female boxers in the United States are being joined by rapidly increasing numbers internationally. The Internet swarms with Web sites devoted to the sport, and its commercial value is also building. Cable television ratings for women's boxing are consistently high, and the cinematic possibilities are surfacing in films like ''Girlfight,'' which won a Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance festival, and the documentary ''Shadow Boxers,'' which is earning rave reviews on the festival circuit.
