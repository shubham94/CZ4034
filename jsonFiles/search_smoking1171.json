ANEW understanding of how a mother affects her unborn child is emerging from a landmark series of studies based on nearly 60,000 births in the United States. The studies, which followed more pregnancies, and for longer periods, than had been done before, raise questions about the safety of working until the end of pregnancy and explain how sexual intercourse, cigarette smoking, poor nutrition and advanced maternal age can compromise the health and survival of the fetus. Underlying most of the adverse effects noted thus far is a reduced blood supply to the fetus, according to Dr. Richard L. Naeye, professor of pathology at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center here. A fetus that receives less blood would get fewer nutrients and less oxygen to grow on, resulting in a baby that is smaller and perhaps less resilient than normal. Although birthweight alone is never seen as the only determinant of any particular baby's prospects, Dr. Naeye explained that the notion had validity for the purposes of public health statistics. A statistician, for example, would consider seven-pound babies as a group to have better prospects than six-and-a-half-pound babies, based on public health figures.", "snippet": "HERSHEY, Pa.
