Not surprisingly, there are rules. In 1987, Dr. John Bower, a kidney specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, was sued after dismissing from his practice a patient who regularly missed dialysis appointments, verbally abused nurses and even threatened to kill Bower and a hospital administrator. Bower cited medical noncompliance and violent threats as grounds for terminating care. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, agreed with him, ruling that doctors can refuse to treat violent or intransigent patients as long as they give proper notice so that the patient can find alternative care. Forcing doctors to treat such patients, the court said, would violate the 13th Amendment, which prohibits involuntary servitude. Sometimes doctors can refuse to treat on the basis of conscience. I once took care of a man in his 50's who had metastatic tongue cancer and respiratory failure requiring a ventilator. His family refused to turn off the machine and let him die, choosing instead to escalate treatment with even more aggressive interventions. Medicine is a stochastic science -- no doctor can predict the future -- but in this case the outcome was never in doubt. Advanced cancer patients who end up on ventilators die during their hospitalizations. Life support was futile, and continuing to insert catheters and tubes into this man seemed inhumane. After the attending physician and I consulted with the hospital's ethics committee, we told the family that we could no longer obey their wishes. We gave them the option of transferring the patient to another hospital. They didn't want to do that; treatment was scaled back, and the man died a few days later.", "snippet": "When can a doctor refuse to treat a patient? Not surprisingly, there are rules.
