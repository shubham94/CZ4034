They totally ignored a large body of evidence that contradicts their position. Marco77 It's all about cost first, quality second. In this health care debate, you get to pick your poison, but both pills are bitter. Bill My first mammogram, at the age of 40, showed I had ductal carcinoma in situ. Surgery followed. Five years later, I had invasive cancer, a far more aggressive and dangerous disease. It is unthinkable that mammograms should be withheld until the age of 50. It is also unforgivable that a remote task force could propose such a disturbing and alarming suggestion. cjm What about screening for prostate cancer? Oh, of course, men are better able to deal with the trauma of false positives. Fragile women must be shielded from this awful fate, even at the risk of their lives. Silly me.
