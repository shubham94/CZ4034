It's a question millions of women ask themselves these days, as baby boomers near or recently past menopause try to decide whether to take hormone replacement. Joining them are millions of older women, many of whom have been taking estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progestin for years and wonder if it is wise to continue, as well as many others who wonder if it is wise to start. At issue is an oft-repeated finding that the use of hormone replacement is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, especially when the hormones are taken for upwards of 10 years or more.
