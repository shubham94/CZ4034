What does that mean?'' The questioner was not sure whether to worry. He is one of many thousands of people who periodically have a triglyceride measurement taken as part of a routine health checkup; if all Americans were tested at least one in 20 would be found to have triglyceride, or fat, levels in their blood that are generally regarded as ''too high.'' His concern was only partly relieved when he was told that his doctor was also probably uncertain about the importance of elevated triglycerides. The debate about triglycerides makes the cholesterol controversy seem like an open-and-shut case. High triglyceride levels in the blood are unquestionably associated with increased risk of developing heart and blood vessel diseases. The debate turns on whether triglycerides directly contribute to the artery-clogging disease atherosclerosis or whether they are only an indicator for other factors that do the damage more directly. If they are merely an indicator, then some experts question the need to institute treatment to bring elevated levels to normal. While scientists and physicians argue the issue, it pays, for the sake of your health and peace of mind, to bypass the debate and try to understand the causes and potential significance of high triglyceride levels.", "headline": {"main": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": 1233, "_id": "4fd124528eb7c8105d5e98e9", "snippet": "''THE doctor said my cholesterol was O.K. but my triglycerides were too high.

The children tend to relax, stop yelling and banging and often fall asleep within 10 minutes, said Paul E. Boccumini, director of clinical services for the department. This approach to calming manic and psychotic juveniles contrasts sharply with the use of brute force favored as little as three years ago. ''We used to have to literally sit on them,'' said Mr. Boccumini, a clinical psychologist. ''Now we put them in the pink room. It works.'' Not all psychologists are quite so sure; many, to put it mildly, remain skeptical. Nonetheless, officials at an estimated 1,500 hospitals and correctional institutions across America have become sufficiently convinced of the pacifying effect of bubble gum pink to color at least one room that shade.", "headline": {"main": "COLOR HAS A POWERFUL EFFECT ON BEHAVIOR, RESEARCHERS ASSERT"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1387, "_id": "4fd128438eb7c8105d5ef0a1", "snippet": "WHEN children under detention at the San Bernardino County Probation Department in California become violent, they are put in an 8-foot by 4-foot cell with one distinctive feature - it is bubble gum pink.
