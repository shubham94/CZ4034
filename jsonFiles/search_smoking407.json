(13) TURKEY'S TIGERS -- At the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Turkey has long been run by secular politicians and businessmen aligned with the West, while pious Muslims have been jostled to the sidelines. This ''Wide Angle'' documentary looks at the Anatolian Tigers, a group of Muslim businessmen like Mustafa Karaduman (above), the chief executive of the country's largest Islamic-style clothing chain, who are embracing Western capitalism while ascending the ranks of Turkish society. 8 P.M. (History) THE EGYPTIAN BOOK OF THE DEAD -- It tells why the Egyptians built the pyramids and may have been the source of the 10 Commandments. (Some archaeologists argue that Moses co-opted a copy when he fled Egypt.) This special uses re-enactments and computer animation to follow the ancient scroll across nearly 4,000 years. 8 P.M. (NBC) FEAR FACTOR -- A Hurricane Katrina anniversary ''Fear Factor''? In this ''disaster'' episode, contestants must endure hurricane-force rain and wind while teetering on a ledge 100 feet in the air, eat cockroaches and battle a flash flood. 8 P.M. (CBS) J. C. PENNEY JAM: THE CONCERT FOR AMERICA'S KIDS -- It takes a village, or at least a chorus. Mary J. Blige (left), Andrea Bocelli, Jon Bon Jovi, Chris Botti, Kenny Chesney, Peter Cincotti, 3 Doors Down, Sara Evans, John Legend, Martina McBride and Sting lend their voices to the cause of children's education in this concert special supporting the J. C. Penney Afterschool Fund. Dr. Phil McGraw and his wife, Robin, are hosts. 9 P.M. (HBO) WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE: A REQUIEM IN FOUR ACTS -- Tonight, Acts III and IV in Spike Lee's visual epic about the effects of Hurricane Katrina on residents of New Orleans. 10 P.M. (Discovery Health) STRICTLY DR. DREW -- Smoking, drinking, gambling and too many cups of coffee. Dr. Drew Pinsky discusses addictions that destroy lives. 10 P.M. (13) LOMAX THE SONGHUNTER -- Alan Lomax was a man on a mission: to record the world's folk tunes before they would permanently disappear. Using film clips of Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly, and interviews with friends like Pete Seeger, this ''P.O.V.'' documentary follows his trail, from the cotton fields, rock quarries and prisons of this country to remote mountain villages in Spain and Italy, to recreate some of what Lomax heard before his death in 2001. 10 P.M. (Bravo) QUEER EYE -- A year of marriage, a year's worth of fat. Tonight, the Fab Five help Erik and Khadijah Williams (right) celebrate their anniversary with a new apartment, new bodies and new moves. KATHRYN SHATTUCK", "snippet": "9 P.M.
