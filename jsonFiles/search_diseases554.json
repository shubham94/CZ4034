CLARK--Duncan W., M.D. The SUNY Downstate Medical Center community mourns the passing of Duncan W. Clark, M.D, professor emeritus of preventive medicine and community health. Dr. Clark helped pioneer the concepts and methods of family-based study, predating by four decades the case-based learning widely used at medical schools nationwide. The textbook he coedited, Preventive Medicine, is a classic in medical education. A teacher and mentor of thousands of physicians, he championed public health causes from water fluoridation to the importance of hand-washing in the prevention of disease transmission. A Class of 1936 alumnus of SUNY Downstate when it was known as The Long Island College of Medicine, he later served as dean of the college. In 1950, Dr. Clark was instrumental in merging the campus with the State University of New York, from which he received an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 2000. A past president of the New York Academy of Medicine, the Academy of Medicine of Brooklyn, and the Medical Society of the County of Kings, he served virtually his entire long and distinguished career at Downstate, including 35 years as chair of preventive medicine and community health. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family, colleagues, and friends. John C. LaRosa, MD President Ian L. Taylor, MD, PhD Senior Vice President for Biomedical Education and Research and Dean of the College of Medicine Pascal James Imperato, MD, MPH&TM Distinguished Service Professor and Chair, Preventive Medicine and Community Health CLARK--Duncan. The New York Academy of Medicine acknowledges with profound sorrow the death of Duncan W. Clark, M.D., former Academy President from 1983 to 1984, trustee from 1985 to 1989, and chairman of the Committee on Medicine in Society from 1978 to 1982. Dr. Clark is remembered for his significant contributions to improving community health and for increasing the focus on preventive medicine in medical school education. Dr. Clark led a distinguished career at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, that included 28 years as Chairman of the Department of Environmental Medicine and Community Health, where he emphasized the need to understand the social and environmental conditions under which diseases occur. Through extensive public service to dozens of local, state and national health organizations, Dr. Clark was dedicated to improving the health of all of the public. Dr. Clarks wisdom and drive made him an influential figure to generations of medical and public health students, residents and fellows. Dr. Clark will continue to be honored annually at the Academy with an endowed lecture in his name, as since 1986. The Academy Board, Fellows and staff extend the deepest condolences to his family.
