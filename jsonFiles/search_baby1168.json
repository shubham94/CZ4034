As snow began to fall at noon one wintry New York day, Kenneth S. Schuman, then an associate at the Wall Street investment banking firm of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, was asked by a senior partner to stand by. A major deal was in the wind, and Schuman soon would be asked to put together a rush report on the project. At 4:45 P.M., his orders finally came through. Ordinarily, Schuman would have sighed, remained at the office and labored over the complex report until early the next morning. But this evening was different. Schuman's wife, Wendy, a magazine editor, had left for an overnight assignment in Maryland; the teen-age babysitter staying with their daughter Cory, then 7 years old, was waiting to be relieved; and outside, the biggest storm of the season was under way. Schuman simply had to get home, important deal or no important deal.", "headline": {"main": "PUTTING KIDS FIRST"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "47", "word_count": 4639, "_id": "4fd15a548eb7c8105d63fccd", "snippet": "IT WAS A BLIZZARD THAT FINALLY FORCED THE issue into the open.

Real estate ads proclaim the town as ''horse country.'' But where horses roam, manure piles up behind barns and in fields. Some town officials view the stockpiles as threats to the environment, while other townspeople just don't like the smell or sight of the stuff. After years of discussing the manure pile issue, the Zoning Board of Appeals will hold a townwide meeting Thursday on the subject. Town officials, horse and stable owners, and conservation experts will search for a solution to what some people see as a long-standing problem, and others don't even see as a problem. ''Having the horses here is delightful; there's no question about that; but there is a seamy side to everything, and manure happens to be the seamy side of the horse business,'' said Daniel L. Betterton, building inspector and zoning enforcement officer for the town. ''What we are trying to do is to see that the manure is disposed of properly. Every adult horse produces eight-and-a-half tons of manure a year. That's a startling number.''", "headline": {"main": "WITH HORSES EVERYWHERE, ALAS, MANURE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1450, "_id": "4fd15a548eb7c8105d63fcda", "snippet": "SOME wags divide the citizenry of this northern Westchester town into ''the cavalry and the foot soldiers,'' for North Salem is a fox-hunting, trail-riding and horse-showing enclave surrounded by encroaching suburban subdivisions.
