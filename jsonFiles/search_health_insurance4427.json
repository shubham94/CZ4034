But, as the Mayor points out, he has already accomplished some things his critics claimed could not be done. Most notably, he has persuaded unions to accept a severance plan for city employees and to give him extraordinary authority to transfer employees between agencies. The budget Mr. Giuliani submitted to the City Council yesterday was his formal plan for fiscal 1995, starting July 1. He faced an awesome $2.3 billion deficit -- the largest since the city's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's. And closing the gap is made more difficult by the public's rebellion against further tax increases. In contrast to predecessors who raised taxes, the Mayor opts to cut them -- only $35 million next year, but $260 million the year after, and more after that.

His proposal looks like the first serious effort to reach out to Republicans for a needed bipartisan compromise.
