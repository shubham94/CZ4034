As the industry most affected by this legislation, we were dismayed because the information on which you apparently based your new position is false on many counts: * You say the bill would extend pharmaceutical patents for up to seven years beyond the conventional 17-year term. This is not true. The bill would restore up to seven years of patent life lost during the drug development and approval process. Effective patent life for new drugs (using new 1980 drugs for purposes of calculation) would average 10 to 13 years, depending on whether the House or Senate formulas were accepted. * You assert that Congress is about to act after only ''a hasty review'' of the facts. Not true. This legislation is the product of over four years of study.", "headline": {"main": "FAIR AND VITAL LEGISLATION ON DRUG PROBLEMS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "word_count": 871, "_id": "4fd125388eb7c8105d5eafe9", "snippet": "To the Editor:    In an Aug. 7 editorial, you reversed your earlier position and opposed passage of the patent restoration legislation awaiting floor action in the House of Representatives.
