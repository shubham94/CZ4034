Appelbaum, M.D., is assistant professor of psychiatry and law at the University of Pittsburgh and co-author of the forthcoming ''Clinical Handbook of Psychiatry and Law.'' By Paul S. Appelbaum Charles L., a 19-year-old former college student, told his psychiatrist that his life was like a novel written by Kafka. His parents were trying to harm him, he said, and his neighbors were colluding in those plans. As he spoke, his words sometimes an incoherent jumble, Charles would grin oddly, as if to mock his own fears. After two months of hospitalization, however, and treatment with antipsychotic medications, Charles no longer expressed the fears of being harmed that his psychiatrist called delusions. Now approaching discharge, Charles had new complaints: He objected to his medication, claiming it blurred his vision, made his hands tremble and caused a restless feeling in his legs. Although his parents pleaded with him to continue taking it, reminding him that his last refusal had precipitated the current hospitalization, Charles refused to take the drug again. He had never been ill in the first place, he said, and had no need for treatment.", "headline": {"main": "CAN MENTAL PATIENTS SAY NO TO DRUGS?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "46", "word_count": 4138, "_id": "4fd121318eb7c8105d5e2eb2", "snippet": "Paul S.

In preparation for a hearing Friday, Representative Claude D. Pepper, Democrat of Florida, chairman of the Select Committee on Aging, analyzed the effects of the changes in Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly, and Medicaid, the program of medical assistance for the poor. Medicaid, he said, pays 13 percent of the health care costs of older Americans. He said the elderly would pay more under the proposed changes in Medicare because of an increase in a deductible for physicians' services and in ''co-payments'' for home health care, as well as a one-month delay in coverage for those reaching the age of 65.", "headline": {"main": "STUDIES OF WELFARE CUTS ASSESS HARM TO ELDERLY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "20", "word_count": 602, "_id": "4fd11ee78eb7c8105d5de2b3", "snippet": "President Reagan's proposals for cutting Medicare and Medicaid benefits would substantially increase the health care costs of the elderly, and his proposed cuts in food stamp benefits would remove from the rolls more than 40 percent of the elderly in...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/19/us/studies-of-welfare-cuts-assess-harm-to-elderly.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK STATE"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DIET AND NUTRITION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD STAMPS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICAID"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AGED"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GOVERNMENT SPENDING"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Robert", "lastname": "PEAR"}, {"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 2}], "original": "By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1982-03-19T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; U.S."}, {"type_of_material": "Letter", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: In opposing the regulations proposed by Secretary Schweiker to notify parents if any contraceptive drugs or devices are prescribed for unemancipated minors, we have been joined by the seven major organizations of health professionals working with teen-agers, with a combined membership of more than 500,000 nurses and physicians. v. e oppose these regulations because we firmly believe that they will intrude the government into family life in a way that will harm the unity of the family and will endanger the health and well-being of hundreds of thousands of young Americans.", "headline": {"main": "'DANGEROUS GASMES' ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": 253, "_id": "4fd121358eb7c8105d5e31dd", "snippet": "To the Editor:     In opposing the regulations proposed by Secretary Schweiker to notify parents if any contraceptive drugs or devices are prescribed for unemancipated minors, we have been joined by the seven major organizations of health...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/18/opinion/l-dangerous-gasmes-about-birth-control-258414.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIRTH CONTROL AND FAMILY PLANNING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FAMILIES AND FAMILY LIFE"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1982-03-18T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}], "meta": {"hits": 4, "offset": 0, "time": 142}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
