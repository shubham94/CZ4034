CHILD abuse and custody battles are the closest most modern Americans come to real tragedy - the unstoppable playing out of a conflict that reveals only the worst in the participants and in the end challenges the very concept of hope. These issues, whether told in fiction or nonfiction, can't help being dramatic and involving, but they almost always have a hectic edge to them, the effect of too many events piling into too little time. By the first moment the abuse is discovered or the custody battle joined, the most important good - the child's mental health - already seems lost, and every subsequent event seems certain to compound the loss with additional damage. Paula Sharp, the author of three earlier novels and a translator of Latin American fiction, bravely wrestles with this intransigent material in her new novel and manages to illuminate some aspects of it with fresh insights. But in ''Crows Over a Wheatfield'' she is finally defeated, because the tone and the events of the novel, which spans 35 years, are somewhat at odds. Ms. Sharp would like to be poking gentle fun at the life and habits of folks in northern Wisconsin (admittedly an idiosyncratic region), but she would also like to be evoking terror and making some sharp observations about the American judiciary system. Ultimately, the mix doesn't quite convince me. The elements are promising, though. The narrator, Melanie Ratleer, and her half brother, Matthew, are the children of Joel Ratleer, a singularly cruel and abusive man. A criminal defense lawyer, he is already famous and admired throughout the Midwest by the mid-1950's. The turning point in the relationship between the father and his children comes in 1965 through a locally notorious case in which a housekeeper coldly murders three small children in her care. While everyone, including the murderer, acknowledges her guilt, Joel Ratleer manages to get her off by impugning the character of the children's father. The moral corruption of the case is so vicious that even the defendant protests. Fifteen-year-old Matthew, forced by his father to help him on the case, responds by taking a considerable quantity of LSD. He becomes psychotic and is institutionalized. This section only serves, however, as a prologue. Melanie, who goes off to become an insurance lawyer and then a judge in New York, is later drawn through Matt and her stepmother into two Wisconsin custody battles involving Mildred Steck, a woman Melanie finds charismatic and admirable. After disappearing in the 1970's to protect her son from his abusive father, Mildred surfaces in the 90's as the founder of the Railroad, a network of small anarchic cells that provide escape and safe haven for parents and children caught in the Family Court system. According to Ms. Sharp, a practicing criminal lawyer in New York, this system has no redeeming, or even neutral, qualities. Through it, children and their parents (sometimes men, but most often women) are routinely destroyed by the moral corruption of individual judges and the legal tricks of top-dollar lawyers, who twist the intent of often ill-thought-out and oddly assorted state laws to punish victims of domestic violence and insure their continued victimization, sometimes unto death. The mere quest for survival forces the victims of these courts underground, where they take on new names and identities, move far away and attempt to disappear, at least until their children are 18 and no longer subject to custody. Ms. Sharp develops her indictment of the legal system as a novelist should - with vivid stories that get the reader riled up. Clearly, she brings knowledge of the law to bear on the subject - the courtrooms and lawyers she describes are convincing and detailed. But the very color of the stories finally causes this reader to draw back: if it is this bad, why isn't Ms. Sharp writing nonfiction - with many more examples, an objective tone and wide-ranging statistics? I am riled up, yes, but I believe I am being used a bit, the way novelists almost always use you, not for a larger purpose but for suspense only. This, I believe, is called exploitation. What I think Ms. Sharp is trying to do, through Melanie Ratleer, is to link the personal and the professional, the child and the adult. Melanie is open about how her own abuse and the insanity of her brother have molded her - she's become a law-obsessed machine who hardly speaks, is unmarried and isolated, and works almost 24 hours a day. She enormously admires Mildred, the founder of the Railroad, who is filled with energy, self-reliant, creative, beautiful and brave. Though Mildred's spiritual ancestor is supposedly John Brown, Ms. Sharp doesn't dare make her as problematic a character as Brown was - she is nonviolent and rational. But Ms. Sharp's attempt to have it all - both Melanie's salvation and her condemnation of the judicial system, both comedy and tragedy - doesn't quite work. For the sake of the comedy, all of Melanie's friends are lovely and benign, wise and good. For the sake of the tragedy, all of the minions of the corrupt courts are ugly, foolish, evil and mysterious. The most enjoyable parts of the novel, for me, are the peripheral bits, and these show that Ms. Sharp is clearly a writer of significant talents. She brings precision and lyricism to her descriptions of northern Wisconsin, evoking quite neatly both the darkness of the winter and the brightness of the summer. There are nice touches, too, in the peculiarities of such local sights as a giant neon yellow muskie (a type of pike) and a store sign advertising ''Liquor - beer - cheese - bakery - live bait,'' all the pleasures of Wisconsin outside of Madison. She brings the House on the Rock into the literary arena, and Spring Green and Frank Lloyd Wright's home, Taliesin. This beautiful sense of place, though, is crying out to be in another novel, one in which it is more than scenery. Even so, ''Crows Over a Wheatfield'' does ask serious questions about issues that many Americans deal with only reluctantly. That the novelist cannot resolve them is a testament to their importance and their mind-numbing difficulty.", "headline": {"main": "In Custody"}, "abstract": "Jane Smiley reviews book Crows Over A Wheatfield by Paula Sharp; drawing (L)", "print_page": "13", "word_count": 1055, "_id": "4fd1f3818eb7c8105d74b8fd", "snippet": "Crows Over a WheatField  By Paula Sharp.  404 pp. New York:  Hyperion. $22.95.
