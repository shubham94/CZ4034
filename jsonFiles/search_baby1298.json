In fact, practically every system in the body -from the blood, with its rising and falling concentrations of iron, hormones and infection-fighting cells, to the body temperature, heartbeat and blood pressure - has its own rhythm that may fluctuate over a period of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years, according to research here that promises to change present approaches to diagnosis and treatment, and perhaps teaching, travel and work schedules as well. Studies at the University of Minnesota show that, far from being a pseudoscientific fiction, biological rhythms can influence susceptibility to disease, response to therapy and performance on a wide variety of mental and physical tasks. The research, which now involves cooperative studies with scientists in several other states and countries, has raised serious questions about the adequacy of current diagnostic techniques and treatment sch ules, the safety and productivity of shift work and the wisdom of typical American meal patterns.", "headline": {"main": "BODY'S MANY RHYTHMS SEND MESSAGES ON WHEN TO WORK AND WHEN TO PLAY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1583, "_id": "4fd11d028eb7c8105d5dab8e", "snippet": "IF you need to hammer some nails, the best time to do it may be at 3 P.M.

American travelers are always looking for new places to go, places not yet swarming with package tours, places relatively free from chronic hurricanes, cyclones, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes - or bugs in the salad. Above all, in these parlous times, they seek a safe place. Their idea of a happy holiday does not include political turmoil, riots, coups, revolutions, crime in the streets, or the sporadic bomb. This can limit their choice of destination, except for determinedly rugged types who opt for Antarctica. Well, where else? It was the late actor Peter Finch who told me about Lugano, a town in southern Switzerland that stands on the edge of Lake Lugano, the other shores of which are Italian. He and his wife had a house in Ruvigliana, one of the many small villages that dot the hills above the lake.
