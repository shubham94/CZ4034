The secretary general of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, announced the meeting and advised the Israelis and Palestinians to start cooling the continuing tensions in the West Bank and Gaza. 1 Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite Muslim guerrilla movement, appears to be playing a growing role in encouraging the Palestinian uprising against Israel in recent days. 13 Arab newspapers are filled with the language of hate and denial that characterized Arab political discourse toward Israel during the outbreak of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. 13 Young Indonesian members of the Islamic Defenders Front, a radical Muslim group, are stalking a Jakarta airport, aiming to kill any Israeli setting foot in the world's largest Muslim country. 13 Investigation of Warship Blast A team of F.B.I. agents, Navy investigators and other anti-terrorist experts arrived in the Yemeni port city of Aden to hasten the inquiry into the explosion aboard the destroyer Cole that killed 17 American sailors. 1 The architect of the plan to send United States Navy ships into the port of Aden defended his decision, saying he was trying to prevent Yemen from becoming a ''rats' nest'' of terrorist groups. 18 Hijacked Plane in Mideast At least two men hijacked a Saudi Arabian passenger jet enroute to London and forced it to land in Baghdad, where Iraqi officials later announced that they had negotiated the freedom of all aboard. 15 Deterring Smoking Worldwide Officials from 191 governments are gathering this week to begin negotiating a new global treaty aimed at controlling the use of tobacco and curbing smoking. 10 NATIONAL 24-38 No Room for Error As Election Day Nears The presidential race is so tight that it has set off a lively debate over whether Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush should try to pull ahead or play it safe and hope for the best on Election Day. Top strategists and politicians on both sides are jittery and readily acknowledge that they could lose. 1 Voters in many Southern states are steeped in doubt and ambivalence about Vice President Al Gore. 28 Many of Ralph Nader's supporters say they are aware that a vote for Mr. Nader might only help Gov. George W. Bush. But they still plan to side with the Green Party. 28 The issue of the uninsured has flared anew with a round of charges and countercharges about the Bush record in Texas. But many health policy experts say that the 42.6 million Americans without health insurance are drawing far less attention now than in previous campaigns. 30 Stock Investors Optimistic Evidence suggests that despite the plunge in technology stocks, American investors remain optimistic that stocks are the best place for their money. 1 Hate Attack in a Small Town A stabbing death in a mostly white resort town in Washington State has prompted Asian-American groups to ask the F.B.I. to determine whether the police had allowed racial crimes to go unchecked. 24 Bill Would Expand Benefits Elderly people will receive several new Medicare benefits under legislation sailing through Congress with bipartisan support. 24 Crime Rates Fall Again Crime in the United States fell again in 1999, the eighth consecutive decline, and the murder rate reached its lowest level since 1966. But experts caution that the decline may be nearing an end. 36 NEW YORK/REGION 41-46 Retail Construction Continues Despite Hints of a Slowdown Economists and retail analysts say they are seeing what may be a softening in what is acknowledged as the strongest retail environment in decades. Despite the trend, a large number of retail construction projects continue to rise in New York City. 41 Baseball Fans Wonder, What If There is no doubt that most people around town are dying for a Yankees-Mets World Series. But with a potential Subway Series putting the ultimate baseball bragging rights on the line, some fans would rather see only one New York squad make it into the championship than risk the indignity that their own beloved team should suffer a humiliating loss to a crosstown rival. 41 OBITUARIES 48 Daniel H.
