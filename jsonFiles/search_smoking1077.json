For nearly two decades, experts on the health effects of smoking have been warning women that if they imitate the smoking patterns of men, the patterns of disease and death that plague men inexorably will follow. But American women, apparently bent on sexual equality, took to smoking with a vengeance. Even while the habit was declining among men, it rose among women, especially better-educated women who were breaking into occupations dominated by men.", "snippet": "ONE of the grimmest firsts of 1985 involves lung cancer, which this year is expected to become the leading cause of cancer death in American women.
