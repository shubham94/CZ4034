If so, resveratrol would lose much of its scientific interest because its link to the sirtuin would be unclear. But a new study led by David Sinclair of the Harvard Medical School, who in 2003 was a discoverer of resveratrol\u2019s role in activating sirtuins, found that resveratrol did indeed influence sirtuin directly, though in a more complicated way than previously thought. Resveratrol appears to work by changing the shape of the sirtuin proteins in a cell. Thus activated, the sirtuins do several things, one of which is to switch on a second protein that spurs production of the mitochondria, which provide the cell\u2019s energy. This would explain why mice treated with resveratrol ran twice as far on a treadmill before collapsing from exhaustion as untreated mice.", "headline": {"main": "Nutrition: New Optimism on Resveratrol", "kicker": "WELL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": "243", "_id": "5147e2fffdc5926e77000cb3", "snippet": "A cloud has long hung over the intriguing thesis that  resveratrol , a minor ingredient of red wine, activates cellular proteins known as sirtuins that promote longer life in laboratory worms, flies and mice.&#xa;   &#xa;Critics have suggested that...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E6DF1438F931A25750C0A9659D8B63", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Nicholas", "rank": 1, "lastname": "WADE"}], "original": "By NICHOLAS WADE"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2013-03-12T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Science"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": null, "headline": {"main": "New Optimism on Resveratrol ", "kicker": "Well", "print_headline": "Nutrition: New Optimism on Resveratrol"}, "abstract": "A new study found that resveratrol, a minor ingredient of red wine, directly influenced sirtuins, proteins that promote longer life in laboratory worms, flies and mice.", "print_page": null, "word_count": "225", "_id": "513e2b55cf28d04ae000232b", "snippet": "A new study found that resveratrol, a minor ingredient of red wine, directly influenced sirtuins, proteins that promote longer life in laboratory worms, flies and mice.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/new-optimism-on-resveratrol/", "multimedia": [{"subtype": "wide", "url": "images/2013/03/12/science/12BRIE_SPAN/12BRIE-thumbWide.jpg", "height": 126, "width": 190, "legacy": {"wide": "images/2013/03/12/science/12BRIE_SPAN/12BRIE-thumbWide.jpg", "wideheight": "126", "widewidth": "190"}, "type": "image"}, {"subtype": "xlarge", "url": "images/2013/03/12/science/12BRIE_SPAN/12BRIE-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 424, "width": 600, "legacy": {"xlargewidth": "600", "xlarge": "images/2013/03/12/science/12BRIE_SPAN/12BRIE-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargeheight": "424"}, "type": "image"}, {"subtype": "thumbnail", "url": "images/2013/03/12/science/12BRIE_SPAN/12BRIE-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2013/03/12/science/12BRIE_SPAN/12BRIE-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "Resveratrol (Chemical)", "is_major": "Y", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Longevity", "is_major": "Y", "rank": "2", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Wines", "is_major": "Y", "rank": "3", "name": "subject"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Nicholas", "lastname": "WADE"}], "original": "By NICHOLAS WADE"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2013-03-11T15:06:07Z", "section_name": "Health"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": null, "headline": {"main": "Your Guide to New York's Soda Ban", "kicker": "City Room"}, "abstract": "Mayor Michael R.
