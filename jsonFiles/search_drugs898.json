Goodman, a renowned pharmacologist, a discoverer of the first effective anticancer chemotherapy and a creator of a textbook used by generations of doctors, died at his home in Salt Lake City on Nov. 19. He was 94 and had taught for many years at the University of Utah. In Salt Lake City in 1946, Dr. Goodman also supervised a daring experiment in which his team totally and temporarily paralyzed a colleague with curare, the muscle relaxant that South American Indians used as a poison. Until then, few doctors had used curare in patients for fear that it produced permanent paralysis. That and other experiments helped widen use of curare and similar drugs, greatly increasing the safety of anesthesia and allowing surgeons to develop new operations.", "headline": {"main": "Dr. Louis S.
