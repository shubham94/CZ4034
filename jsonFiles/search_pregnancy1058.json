I was a graduate student in New York, but I returned to my home in New Haven, Conn., to be with him. As the end drew near, his suffering became intense, the pain harder and harder to control. He was being cared for by an extraordinary doctor: Seymour Lipsky, then chief of hematology at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Dr. Lipsky did not have a private practice, but he had volunteered to take care of my father, telling us to call him whenever we felt we needed him. When we called, he came to the house. My father's drug bills were being paid by the New Haven Cancer Society. We had long used a nearby pharmacy, but now the pharmacist grumbled whenever we came. Dr. Lipsky, new in the state, did not yet have a narcotics license, so he wrote his prescriptions and another doctor signed them. The pharmacist complained about this. But he complained even more about the Cancer Society's slowness in paying: several times he told us that he doubted that he would be paid at all.", "headline": {"main": "Prescription for Injustice", "kicker": "Op-Ed Contributor"}, "abstract": "Op-Ed article by Florence A Ruderman on growing movement of pharmacists who refuse to fill prescriptions to which they have moral or religious objections, mostly related to birth control; says one such organization, Pharmacists for Life International, claims to have 1,600 members; says they invoke 'conscience' when refusing to fill particular prescriptions, and now they are asking for state laws that not only recognize right to refusal, but also shield them from lawsuits if that refusal results in harm; says allowing pharmacist right to refuse to fill legal prescription surrenders right of majority to willful obstruction by determined minority; hopes state legislatures find courage to resist theseundemocratic tides; drawing (M)", "print_page": "23", "word_count": 1388, "_id": "4fd286318eb7c8105d856e1c", "snippet": "Allowing pharmacists not to fill lawful prescriptions based on their own moral or religious beliefs is undemocratic.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/01/opinion/01ruderman.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "imagepages/2005/08/31/opinion/01ruderman.html", "rank": "1", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupWidth1": "250", "MultimediaUrl1": "imagepages/2005/08/31/opinion/01ruderman.html", "MultimediaPopupHeight1": "325", "MultimediaType1": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "images/2005/08/31/opinion/01ruderman_75.gif", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/08/31/opinion/01ruderman_75.gif"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55, "height": 55}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "PHARMACISTS FOR LIFE INTERNATIONAL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SUITS AND LITIGATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAW AND LEGISLATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIRTH CONTROL AND FAMILY PLANNING"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Florence", "middlename": "A.", "lastname": "Ruderman", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By Florence A.
