Though he'd had asthma since the age of 11, Ivey was an energetic, active young man. He attended Catholic University in Washington on an academic scholarship and played varsity football while also holding down a full-time job and helping raise his 2-year-old daughter. But when he was rushed to the emergency room last fall, gasping for air like a man drowning, Ivey was already doomed. Two weeks earlier, he had begun using his inhaler more frequently to open up his bronchial airways and breathe more easily. Apparently he didn't realize that his increasing need for the inhaler meant something deadly was happening to his lungs.", "snippet": "In the end, it took Mike Ivey, 20, only a few minutes to die.
