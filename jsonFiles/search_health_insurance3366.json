I have taken care of children with similar attributes in the I.C.U., most of them heavyset. Even here in Manhattan, at major teaching hospitals, these patients' conditions are difficult to diagnose. The psychological trauma that stems from the separation of parents and child cannot be overemphasized. We already see the results in Anamarie: delayed speech, flat affect, reluctance to warm to strangers. There are a multitude of issues involved in this case: weight issues, medical, psychiatric and insurance issues, cultural issues. As a mother who has breast-fed three children, I cannot help but compare this with your recent article that mentioned a child who was removed from his home because the mother breast-fed too long. Nobody has the right to separate parents and children unless there is obvious abuse.
