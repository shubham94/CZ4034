No promoting of a particular faith, they say, or even ''the idea of religion or nonreligion,'' in official communications or at official functions. Behind the News -- Complaints from Air Force Academy cadets that evangelical Christian superiors were using their positions to promote their religion led to the development of the guidelines, which do allow for ''a brief sectarian prayer'' at special ceremonies. TUESDAY The News -- White House officials explain how they plan to encourage Iraqis to ratify the proposed constitution. Behind the News -- Endorse the document? Not exactly. But Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, said the United States could ''help explain, in Iraq and to the international community, what is in the document,'' and could work with the United Nations to give technical help to the Iraqis in voter registration and setting up polls. But ''the president has made clear that this is an Iraqi process,'' Mr. Hadley said. WEDNESDAY The News -- Protesting the Food and Drug Administration's delay in approving sales of the so-called morning-after pill without a prescription, a top agency official resigns. Behind the News -- The official, Dr. Susan F. Wood, who was director of the office of women's health, said the pill, known as Plan B, was a way to prevent pregnancy and should not be party to ''abortion politics.'' Opponents of abortion view Plan B as tantamount to abortion. The agency approved it as a prescription contraceptive in 1999. THURSDAY The News -- Scientists report that they have decoded the chimpanzee genome and compared it with humans'. Behind the News -- Monkey see the human genome sequenced, monkey want its own. And it turns out that there are 40 million differences that have arisen since chimps and humans split from a common ancestor six million years ago, which makes it a little difficult to find the changes caused by natural selection. But the comparison did offer insight into the evolution of human sexual behavior, scientists said. FRIDAY The News -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia meets with relatives of the victims of the school siege a year ago in Beslan and promises an accounting. Behind the News -- As the anniversary of the siege, which killed 331 people, 186 of them children, approached, a group called the Beslan Mothers' Committee led protests and challenged the official version of events, accusing the government of covering up a botched rescue. Mr. Putin did not directly address the fury of the relatives over the government's handling of the siege.", "headline": {"main": "Far From the Gulf Coast | Aug. 28-Sept. 3", "kicker": "THE WEEK"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 435, "_id": "4fd251058eb7c8105d7f4ae1", "snippet": "The News The Air Force issues new religion guidelines to its commanders.
