Never having enjoyed a particularly high status even in the best of times, these women soon found themselves in the most dire straits. Widowed by the genocide and stigmatized by rape, they were often cast out of their hometowns. Without husbands to protect them, they lost their connection to community, which forms the bedrock of Rwandan village life. What little attention the world paid to the genocide focused on its carnage and, later, its 1.2 million refugees. The women who stayed in Rwanda, many of whom were sexually mutilated and tortured in addition to raped, were largely invisible to the outside world. This is especially noteworthy since the country had become 70 percent female, 60 percent of whom were widows. Today, with a million refugees having recently streamed home from camps in Zaire, the women who survived in Rwanda are once again slipping beneath the radar of international, and national, interest. ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF KIGALI, A 30year-old widow, Jacqueline Nyirakamana, stands apart from the bustle of her small village and holds her baby daughter, Diane, on her hip. A young boy playfully chases two girls around the dirt compound; adult men are conspicuously absent. The girls hide behind the skirts of one woman, then another, but never behind Nyirakamana. In fact, they avoid her. Nyirakamana has taken up residence, uninvited, in a cement-walled house appointed with a couch and a few comfortable chairs. Her own house, in the city of Butare, was destroyed by the interhamwe, the extremist Hutu militia. Nyirakamana can't go home: everyone she knows in her commune has either been killed or turned out to be a killer. This house was abandoned by a Hutu soldier hiding in Zaire; although it is quite large, Nyirakamana lives here alone with her baby. ''I have little in common with the other women here,'' she says, leading me inside. The reason for her isolation, she explains, is her child, fathered by one of the many Hutu soldiers who raped her, repeatedly, for an entire month. Rwanda now has between 2,000 and 5,000 children born of rape. Commonly considered Hutu despite their mother's ethnicity -- and the Government's almost absurd insistence that ethnicity is now irrelevant -- the babies are called ''little interhamwe'' or ''devil's children.'' Before 1994, rape in Rwanda was uncommon. But during the genocide, women became deliberate targets. For months before the killing began, radio broadcasts and extremist magazines portrayed Tutsi women as arrogant and superior. Cartoons depicted them performing lewd acts. ''They're too tall,'' the newspapers said. ''Cut off their legs.'' Rape, then, was committed not as a personal act of violence but as a political one, used to terrorize entire communities. For those impregnated by their attackers, the destruction of personal and community integrity was nearly complete. Nyirakamana realized she was pregnant after the Rwandan Patriotic Front liberated Kigali, soon after she learned her husband and two children were dead. ''I tried to abort the child but could find no one to do it,'' she says. Rwanda is largely Roman Catholic, and abortion is illegal. But hundreds of raped women did get abortions, either from sympathetic village healers or through a tacit agreement between the Government and the medical community to overlook the law in these extreme cases. Other women gave birth to and simply abandoned their children; another alternative, rarely voiced, was infanticide. Nyirakamana eventually decided to keep her baby, though its very existence suggests to some that she is a collaborator. ''My other children were gone,'' she says flatly, ''so I had to accept this one.'' No one came to visit her when Diane was born, a breach of village decorum. ''The community isn't interested in me or her. I am alone here, and I have nothing but a child from the men who killed my family.'' In Nyirakamana's new neighborhood, men don't talk to her, or to any of the other widows, for fear they'll be accused of having a romantic interest. For widows, new husbands would be nice, but likely candidates -- especially those who would accept a widow who has been raped -- are scarce. Women with babies of rape have even less hope. RWANDAN SOCIETY IS FAIRLY CLOSED, and women don't easily express their trauma. Rape victims especially speak in measured sentences that betray little emotion. But health workers in Rwanda report women wracked by nightmares, who have trouble sleeping and concentrating, who present a litany of psychosomatic ills. ''With a return to normalcy, with the schools and markets open, problems arise,'' says Esmee de Jong, a mental-health coordinator with Doctors Without Borders. ''Many widows we see now are withdrawing and dysfunctional, not capable of properly looking after their children.'' Psychologists worry that trauma is becoming entrenched. While the rape of more than a quarter of a million girls and women astounds and horrifies Westerners, the women have more immediate, material concerns. Many of them desperately need housing, clean water, cropland and money for their children's school fees. Indeed, the troubles of widows seem almost endless. In Rwanda a widow cannot inherit property, houses, cattle or anything else that belonged to her husband. Without her husband's permission, a woman cannot work at night, testify in court or get credit from a bank. Facing a bleak future, the Government of Rwanda is, for the first time, forging a national policy for women, which may include inheritance reforms. ''But women don't necessarily want to play a key role in their future,'' says Aloyise Inyumba, the minister for family and women's affairs. Many Rwandans, she says, men and women alike, consider the proposed reforms too radical. Years ago, when the country considered amending the dowry system, many women opposed the idea, fearing that a fixed bride price of just one cow would reflect poorly on their value. If the inheritance laws do change, acceptance may be a long time coming. ''In a traditional society, claiming property will isolate widows even more,'' says de Jong. ''And when other women see the effect, they may stop pursuing their own rights.'' Nyirakamana, like most women in Rwanda, has no idea what those rights may be. She cannot read. Nor does she have any marketable skills. Large extended families make up the fabric of Rwandan villages, and widows who can call on their distant male relatives do. But those like Nyirakamana, who have lost their entire families and rely for the most part on handouts, may soon discover that the country's latest crisis has strained even the deep pockets of international relief organizations. THE STEEPLY TERRACED HILLS OF KIBUYE prefecture wrap around the eastern shore of Lake Kivu, along Rwanda's border with Zaire. The countryside here, like nearly every place outside Kigali, is aggressively cultivated: groves of plantain trees blanket the uplands; potato plants form a patchwork down below. Women in long skirts tend beans and tomatoes. Boys with closely cropped hair poke sticks at cattle grazing along the red dirt roads. Rich soil and plenty of rain make Rwanda almost frighteningly fecund. Frangipani perfumes the air, and bougainvillea and lantana interrupt a riot of green. Thanks in part to this pastoral abundance, Rwanda, even after the genocide and before the recent influx of refugees, was still one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. While many Hutu women may find their husbands among the returnees, Tutsi widows may feel more isolated than ever. Agnes Mukabacondo, whose husband was killed in the genocide, now runs a group that owns restaurants and employs widows in Kibuye's Gitesi commune. Describing life as a widow in Rwanda, she says: ''The change is profound and difficult to bear. A husband takes care of everything -- you just follow.'' All across the country, I saw women toiling in their homes and fields. The men, it seemed, did nothing. In fact, Mukabacondo tells me, men are constantly busy, protecting family interests by working the subtle and complicated power dynamics of the community. In a country jammed with subsistence farmers, holding onto property can be a full-time job. ''The husband looks for friends for the family,'' she says. ''He forges family links. If you help someone with a cow, he owes you. But when your husband dies, you lose those connections. You try to do it on your own, but it is imperfect.'' Survivors in Kibuye, which saw the genocide's worst violence, have legitimate fears that among those now returning to Rwanda are perpetrators of the genocide. In the commune of Rwamatamu, in southern Kibuye, that fear is palpable: Tutsis here have lived under siege for two years as Hutu soldiers make raids from safe havens over the border. One of those havens, called Idjwi Island, at the southern end of Lake Kivu, lies just off the shores of Rwamatamu. At night, widows who live on the outskirts of town hear the motors of the interhamwe's boats cut out as they near shore. In the morning the women find notes on their doors: ''You're next'' and ''If we don't get 200,000 francs, you're dead.'' The soldiers single out surviving Tutsis, in particular those who may testify at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. A sophisticated network of informants around the commune makes the killers' work easier; in 1996, Hutu soldiers killed scores of witnesses who had agreed to testify. Alone with their children, women are afraid to sleep in their own homes. ''We work our family's land in the daytime,'' says Elodia Mukandekeli, 22, who looks after two orphaned nephews, ''but we sleep in the bush at night, or we keep switching among houses abandoned by Hutu.'' According to de Jong, women like Elodia have long been vulnerable. ''But now we see panic among them as the refugees return,'' she says. ''They have no men to protect them. They can lose their land, their houses. They may have to confront their attackers.'' The vast majority of foreign aid sent to Rwanda in the last two years, about $2.5 billion, has been spent on refugees, with little money, or attention, going to survivors. That seems unlikely to change. Nyirakamana, among many women, hopes to one day confront her rapists and the men who murdered her family. But with the current backlog in the courts -- about 80,000 people linger, untried, in Rwandan prisons -- it's unlikely she'll see justice any time soon. Last year, ''sexual torture'' was classified as a capital crime under new genocide laws, but not a single person has been indicted on that charge alone, and the Ministry of Justice has done nothing to encourage potential witnesses or protect them from reprisal. Manpower and money are scarce as the country struggles to rebuild its entire political, economic, social and administrative systems. And so Nyirakamana waits -- for the owner of her house to return, for the next aid program to roll out. She can't predict where she'll be in a year, or even a month, only that her daughter will one day ask who her father is, and how did all this happen.", "headline": {"main": "The Outcasts"}, "abstract": "Article by Elizabeth Royte on plight of Tutsi women who were raped by Hutu enemy in Rwanda; Hutu soldiers and civilians are thought to have raped 250,000 women when they overran country two years ago; these women, many of them widowed by the genocide, have been stigmatized by the rape; without husbands to protect them, they have lost their connections to community, which forms bedrock of Rwandan village life; for women impregnated by their attackers, destruction of personal and community integrity has been nearly complete; last year, 'sexual torture' was classified as capital crime under new genocide laws, but not single person has been indicted on that charge alone, and Ministry of Justice has done nothing to encourage potential witnesses or protect them from reprisal; photos (L)", "print_page": "37", "word_count": 1871, "_id": "4fd1fd748eb7c8105d75d4ce", "snippet": "TWO YEARS AGO, WHILE RWANDA'S Hutu militias were murdering half a million Tutsis, most of them men, Hutu soldiers and civilians also raped more than 250,000 women.
