Various studies have singled it out as the most promising and possibly the safest antidote to the nation's leading killers, heart disease and cancer. And, while it is protecting coronary arteries against atherosclerosis and DNA against attacks by chemical carcinogens, it may also be keeping normal cells throughout the body from aging prematurely. But vitamin E, chemically named alpha-tocopherol, does all this and more at levels well above those needed to prevent a nutritional deficiency, levels that render it a drug, not a nutrient. As a vitamin, it aids in the formation of red blood cells, muscles and other tissues and prevents oxidation of vitamin A and essential fatty acids. At high levels not attainable through diet -- 40 times or more the nutritionally needed amount -- vitamin E functions as a potent antioxidant. Why Not Take It? Well, then, shouldn't everybody take vitamin E supplements? Certainly, most if not all researchers who study it are taking it, but most are not yet willing to tell the general public to do the same. Are these scientists being hypocritical, telling us one thing and doing another?", "snippet": "IN a nation hungry for simple nutritional solutions to complex health problems, vitamin E might seem to be a panacea.
