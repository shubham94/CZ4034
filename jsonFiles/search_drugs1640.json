The development came after reports Sunday that the Government had suspended efforts to find survivors from the mudslides and flooding that struck Armero and 13 other villages and towns after the eruption Wednesday of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano. Today, army officers in Mariquita, not far from Armero, said they had been ordered to continue searching for 50 more hours. The army officers, who have been pessimistic from the start, said they had thought there was little chance of finding anyone else alive in the mud five days after it gushed over the town, propelled by flood waters that cascaded down the sides of the volcano. Had the Government carried out its plans to end the search and declare the whole town a cemetery, as the Minister of Health, Rafael de Zubiria, announced Sunday afternoon, these people would have been left to die.", "headline": {"main": "5 MORE ARE FOUND ALIVE IN MUD AS COLOMBIAN SEARCH CONTINUES"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1347, "_id": "4fd164768eb7c8105d6510be", "snippet": "Rescue workers found at least five more people alive in the sea of mud in this ruined town today, including an 18-month-old boy.
