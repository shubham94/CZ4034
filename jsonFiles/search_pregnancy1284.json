Workplace friendships are a crossbreed of the species, sturdy yet fragile at the same time. They start out as lunch and evolve into loyalty. As Laura Senturia, an account executive with Schwartz Communications in Waltham, Mass., says about her colleague, Marybeth McLean Roberts: ''Somewhere along the way, 'Marybeth from work' became simply 'Marybeth.' '' It is a transition that comes with a lot of warning labels. There are small land mines to worry about, such as what to do when your best friend gets your promotion, and the more prosaic risk that you become one of those people who talk about nothing but shop over what is supposed to be a social dinner. ''It's like an office romance without the romance,'' jokes Karen Wright, who works in fund-raising and communications at Minnesota State University in Mankato with her close friend, Ann Rosenquist Fee. The two women sing together in a folk band after hours. On top of that, Ms. Fee's husband and Ms. Wright's significant other are professors at the same university (which is how Ms. Wright began dating him in the first place).", "headline": {"main": "A Special Kind of Officemate", "kicker": "LIFE'S WORK"}, "abstract": "Lisa Belkin column on friendships that form among co-workers and the effort needed to preserve them under strains of workplace and after career paths diverge; drawing (M)", "print_page": "1", "word_count": 805, "_id": "4fd2105f8eb7c8105d784665", "snippet": "MY husband is about to lose his best buddy at work.
