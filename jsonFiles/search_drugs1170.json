That would explain how they deal with their responsibility for a product that kills more than 420,000 Americans a year -- surpassing the combined deaths from homicide, suicide, AIDS, automobile accidents, alcohol and drug abuse. But to be in denial implies that one may not be held accountable, in psychological terms, for one's actions. Tobacco people squarely face the accusation of accountability, and reject it. They reject the overwhelming epidemiological evidence in the Surgeon General's Report of 1989, connecting smoking with lung and throat cancers, emphysema and heart disease, insisting that direct causation has not been proved. They dismiss the Federal Drug Administration's suggestion that cigarettes could be banned as an addictive drug, calling smoking merely a habit that has already been broken by tens of millions. They ridicule people who say they are pushing a drug, noting that their product is legal, that the same Government that posts health warnings on cigarette packs subsidizes tobacco farmers and that what they are really promoting is freedom of choice.", "headline": {"main": "How Do Tobacco Executives Live With Themselves?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "36", "word_count": 10327, "_id": "4fd1bf948eb7c8105d6ed2e8", "snippet": "PEOPLE WHO WONDER how tobacco company executives can live with themselves conclude that they must be in denial.
