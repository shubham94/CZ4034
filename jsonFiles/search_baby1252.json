Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services disclosed their plans to pediatricians, obstetricians, gynecologists and hospital administrators at a meeting this afternoon. The new proposal is to be accompanied by a fuller explanation of the reasons for issuing the rule, which many doctors and hospitals oppose as a Federal intrusion into the practice of medicine. The text of the rule itself is almost identical to the one struck down by Judge Gerhard A. Gesell. The Administration is appealing his ruling.", "headline": {"main": "ADMINISTRATION TRIES AGAIN ON CARE LAW FOR IMPAIRED INFANTS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "17", "word_count": 761, "_id": "4fd134028eb7c8105d6038f4", "snippet": "Reagan Administration officials said today that they would try again to require 6,400 hospitals around the country to provide food and medical care to severely handicapped infants, even though a Federal district judge struck down a similar...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/28/us/administration-tries-again-on-care-law-for-impaired-infants.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BIRTH DEFECTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BABIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DISCRIMINATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAW AND LEGISLATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HANDICAPPED"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Robert", "lastname": "PEAR"}, {"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 2}], "original": "By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1983-06-28T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; U.S."}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 38}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
