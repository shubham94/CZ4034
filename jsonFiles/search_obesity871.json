Only about a quarter of the population is getting enough exercise, and that percentage barely budged from 1990 to 1998. The media may be full of beautiful, fit bodies, but neither those images nor the pleading of health experts is having much effect. Most Americans seem content to stay on the couch. The result is ever greater obesity. That doesn't surprise Tomas J. Philipson, an economist at the Irving B. Harris Graduate School of Public Policy Studies at the University of Chicago. Professor Philipson, who applies economic reasoning to public health questions, recently examined the reasons behind increasing obesity. ''People understand better now how to control their weight than historically,'' he notes. ''The information has grown, but we're yet getting fatter over time.'' Something other than ignorance must be driving the trend.", "snippet": "EVER alert for trends that threaten Americans' health, the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention recently reported some bad news.
