Witness the ethical uproar over their latest technological triumph, the apparent reversal of menopause in a 30-year-old ballerina who suffered from ovarian cysts. Doctors removed her remaining ovary, froze the tissue, and, two years later, reimplanted it. Now, they say, she is producing eggs again. The ballerina story follows the same plot line as every other tale of modern baby-making, a genre that began in 1978 with the birth of the first test-tube baby, Louise Brown. The drama typically unfolds as follows: Whiz-bang scientists develop new technique (in vitro fertilization, donated eggs, frozen eggs, frozen ovaries) that makes it possible for childless woman (subtext: old childless woman) to conceive. Media circus ensues. Ethicists ponder potential abuse. Media circus subsides.
