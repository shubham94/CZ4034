Its chances of enacting something worthwhile will be slim if Republicans and Democrats insist on turning the stalemate into a campaign issue with which to hammer each other. The blame strategy, however, could backfire with voters who want protection from unfair health insurance practices. The House has already passed a bill that would guarantee emergency care coverage, allow consumers to appeal denials of coverage to an independent panel and permit women direct access to gynecologists and obstetricians, all of which the Democrats want. But President Clinton is likely to veto this plan because it expands medical savings accounts, a provision strongly opposed by the Democrats, and it does not change existing law that bars consumers from suing federally regulated health plans for damages related to the denial of benefits. The Senate Republican bill, sponsored by Don Nickles of Oklahoma, is unacceptable because it would apply only to the 48 million individuals covered by plans in which large employers act as their own insurers.", "headline": {"main": "Taking Action on Patients' Rights"}, "abstract": "Editorial supports legislation on patients' rights offered by bipartisan group in Senate, which includes almost all the protections favored by Democrats, does not expand medical savings accounts and would allow suits in Federal courts when benefits are denied, but only for recovery of economic damages and attorney's fees", "print_page": "12", "word_count": 407, "_id": "4fd1fe0a8eb7c8105d75ec22", "snippet": "The Senate will not have much time to approve legislation on patients' rights when it returns next week from its August recess.
