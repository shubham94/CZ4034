For Mr. Bentsen, who met with Federal regulators on the businessman's behalf four months before he bought the stock, an investment of $100,000 came to be worth at least $600,000 three years later. The stock was in a company that Federal regulators later determined had been created largely with a subsidy from the businessman's failing savings and loan, an arrangement that helped a small circle of invited investors to profit handsomely. Familiar Ways of Power Mr. Bentsen's part in the stock deal, which he has reported as required in financial disclosure forms over the years, violated no laws or ethical strictures. Nor is there any suggestion that he applied improper pressure on the Federal regulators, who ultimately spurned an appeal for help from the savings and loan operator, J.
