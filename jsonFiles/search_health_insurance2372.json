Selikoff Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine, based at Mount Sinai Medical Center, has been the source of much of what is known about the health problems of ground zero workers. The clinic has examined more than 15,000 workers and volunteers and overseen the examination of 5,000 more at clinics elsewhere; received more than $100 million from the federal government for tracking and treating those workers; published the largest and most often quoted study of recovery workers' ills; and testified about the health problems before city and federal committees.But as a front-page investigation by Anthony DePalma and Serge F. Kovaleski shows, the clinic's performance in several important areas has been flawed. For years after 9/11, it did not have adequate resources or time to properly collect detailed medical data on workers exposed to ground zero dust. The clinic's doctors presented their findings in what other experts say were scientifically questionable ways, exaggerating the health effects with imprecise descriptions of workers' symptoms and how long they might be sick. And researchers in the field say that the clinic's data collection was so badly planned that its usefulness may be limited.", "headline": {"main": "Morning Buzz: Questions on 9/11 Clinic, Hospital Infection Rates, N.J.
