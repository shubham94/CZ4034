Small, MD, who died on June 14th, 2013. Dr. Small was an internationally recognized pediatric hematologist who made important contributions in the development of improved transplantation approaches for the treatment of patients with advanced leukemia and children with life-threatening genetic disorders of the immune system. Dr. Small received her medical degree from SUNY Upstate Medical University of Syracuse and residency training in Pediatrics at Duke University and the University of Minnesota. After specialty training in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, she joined the faculty in 1987 and thereafter rose to its highest rank of full Member. She was also an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Small's research focused on the cellular interactions that control recovery of the immune system after transplantation, and provided the first evidence linking age-related changes in the human thymus with the delayed restoration of cell-mediated immunity observed in older adults after transplantation. She also conducted pioneering studies examining how best to vaccinate patients after transplantation or other cancer treatments to insure full recovery of immunity and protect patients from infection. Her work provided evidence critical to the development of the National Centers for Disease Control's guidelines for vaccination of immunocompromised transplant recipients. Dr. Small's research on lethal genetic immune deficiencies also contributed to more precise characteristics that clarified diagnoses and improved transplantation approaches for curative correction. Dr. Small dedicated her professional life to the care of children who received marrow transplants for life-threatening forms of leukemia and immune deficiency. As a physician and parent, she had a profound understanding of the potentially devastating impact of these diseases on children and their families and how challenging the journey back to health can be. She also had a special way with children that turned fears to confidence and laughter. Dr. Small was beloved by her patients and their families and warmly revered by her many friends and colleagues. She is survived by her husband, Robert Knowles, and her children, Molly and Sam. She will be deeply missed. Richard J. O'Reilly, MD Chair, Department of Pediatrics Melissa S.
