Corzine has spent the last several months learning the difference between office politics and politics. In his previous line of work, at the investment firm of Goldman, Sachs, where he served as chairman and C.E.O. until early last year, Corzine was counted a master politician -- the kind of executive who understood the secret ambitions and fears of everyone around him. On Wall Street, being a good politician had a lot to do with being likable. Now, however, Corzine is running for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate in New Jersey, a state whose politics do not typically reward amiability. Corzine's opponent is Jim Florio, the former governor of the state and a man who is, for good reason, invariably referred to as ''an ex-boxer.'' Last month, according to a news account, Florio fired his media adviser when the adviser refused to follow Florio's ''scorched-earth policy.'' One day last month, I sat with Corzine through an interminable ceremony marking the opening of the 209th session of the New Jersey Legislature. During a lull between the skirling of the bagpipes and the nomination of the clerk of the Assembly, Corzine handed me a copy of a Florio news release. Like a number of leading Democrats, Corzine advocates investing up to 15 percent of the Social Security Trust Fund in the stock market. In the release, Florio not only claimed that Corzine was threatening the stability of Social Security -- arguable, though fair game -- but also went on to declare that the proposal was ''clearly in Jon Corzine's self-interest'' since Goldman and other Wall Street firms would benefit from the trading activity. That was a low blow. Corzine whispered: ''He's saying that I'm going to benefit from this personally. That just makes no sense.''
