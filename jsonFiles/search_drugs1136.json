In the 1960's, the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco was the antithesis of everything the establishment saw as virtuous. The heads in the Haight promoted sex, drugs, rock music and a libertinism that outsiders saw as threatening the very foundations of society but that insiders deemed the pathway to a higher consciousness.

A good part of the answer may lie in their hormones. If studies now under way bear out their initial promise, hormone treatments for people over 60 may help to turn back the clock and, though without extending life, greatly enhance its quality. Researchers are exploring the rejuvenating effects of several hormones that are known to undergo rather striking declines with age. These include, but go beyond, replacing estrogen, which declines sharply in women after menopause. The safety of estrogen replacement, particularly with regard to the risk of breast cancer, is hotly debated and raises a cautionary note about the wisdom of replacing other hormones that fall with age.", "headline": {"main": "Restoring Ebbing Hormones May Slow Aging"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2005, "_id": "4fd1cc708eb7c8105d702abb", "snippet": "WHY do some people in their 80's look, act and feel vigorous and energetic while others need help just to get through the chores of daily living?
