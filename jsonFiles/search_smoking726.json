It works this way: In the desert landscape where the film's he-men battle over stolen nuclear warheads, a seemingly harmless stranger appears. Is he just a tourist? Or is he more dangerous than he looks? Count on this much: It won't take long to find out. Mr. Woo has a way of settling any note of ambiguity with the fast, furious bravado that turns his superkinetic action films into fireball ballet. Thanks to this film maker's tireless gamesmanship (he's guaranteed not to play that tourist trick the same way twice) and his knack for making weapons, explosives or low-flying helicopters turn up in the strangest places, \"Broken Arrow\" packs an impressive wallop. True, Mr. Woo's storytelling skills remain at the level of cartoonish jousting, but \"Broken Arrow\" has its trump cards: killer special effects, John Travolta as an irresistible bad guy, Duane Eddy sometimes twanging his baritone guitar on the soundtrack and casual threats about nuclear destruction of the American Southwest. Not necessarily in that order.", "snippet": "In \"Broken Arrow,\" the Hong Kong-born directing dynamo John Woo sets a tourist trap for his audience -- twice.
