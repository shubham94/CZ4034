{"status": "OK", "response": {"docs": [{"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Financial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "THE ECONOMY Heeeere's Al! Heeeere's Ross! It's the Nafta Follies! It was the television equivalent of historical fiction. The subject was serious, but it had \"entertainment\" written all over it. As entertainment it scored: Last week's Gore-Perot \"chart wars\" (as a White House aide labeled it) drew the largest audience ever for a scheduled cable program. The subject was the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Ross Perot has gleefully blasted, but kernels of serious debate were hard to spot amid the charts, pictures and what were generously called facts. After the dust cleared, the battle raged hotter than ever for lawmakers' hearts as this week's House vote neared. Many Mexicans did not take kindly to Mr. Perot's depiction of a destitute country almost totally lacking in customers with enough money to buy American products. \"Before he opens his mouth,\" a Mexico City lawyer said, \"he ought to come down here and take a look.\" And one newspaper termed Mr. Perot's comments a \"series of calumnies and lies.\" Getting, Spending: A Balancing Act Lawmakers, by and large, decide how this nation gets and spends. If getting doesn't keep up with spending, it's clear where to point fingers. But many lawmakers are saying, in effect, \"We can't do it, so make us do it.\" That's what a balanced-budget amendment comes down to. The idea creates some odd Senate bedfellows -- Paul Simon, liberal stalwart, who favors more getting (taxes), and Orrin Hatch, conservative extraordinaire, who advocates less spending. Cries are getting louder for a vote, but last week, bowing to Thanksgiving, its backers put it off till February. A Pass Is Just a Pass? No Way! The debate heats up daily: Where, in that vast gray area between leer and lunge, does sexual harassment lie? Several Federal courts have ruled that lawsuits should show workplace harassment so bad that it caused \"severe psychological injury.\" Or, in effect, someone can shoot at you as long as you don't get hit. But last week the Supreme Court stepped in and stretched the definition considerably, ruling that harassment that creates a \"hostile and abusive\" environment is illegal. \"The time for strained legal arguments is over,\" said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center. Inflation: It's Gone! It's Back! Inflation was pronounced dead on Tuesday, but some people swore they saw it wink on Wednesday. First came a report that producer prices, having trended downward most of the year, fell another 0.2 percent in October. That provided reassurance that inflation had been tamed, and interest rates retreated. But then came news that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent, the most in six months. The main culprit was a higher gas tax, clearly a one-time blip, but rates headed up again. And the economy is stronger, as the numbers keep showing. On Friday came a report that October's retail sales had risen 1.5 percent, the biggest gain in six months. Slowing Down 10-Ton Speeders Speeding is a big killer on our highways, but it's all relative. A sports car tooling along at 80 is far less lethal than a 10-ton truck. So last week the Transportation Department proposed a ban on radar detectors in trucks over 18,000 pounds. Independent truckers don't like it -- any more than they like the higher diesel prices that spurred last week's protests -- but most other people do, so it will probably happen. Looking Joblessness in the Face Strong as some economic statistics are, they don't help those who are left behind as this nation goes through wrenching changes and dislocations. And their pain could be seen vividly last week on the streets of Detroit, a city that has had its insides torn out by the icy streamlining of the auto industry. Detroit's jobless -- the city's unemployment rate is 13 percent, twice the national rate -- are so hungry for decent work that thousands of them lined up in the cold dawn for jobs that may never exist. The very iffy jobs were advertised by sponsors of a casino in downtown Detroit to be owned by an Indian tribe in northern Michigan. The casino has slim chances of being approved, underscoring the job-seekers' desperation. But as one applicant said, \"There's nothing else happening but crime.\" COMPANIES A Drug Maker Goes to the People Makers of prescription drugs have long stayed above the consumer fray, their prices untouched by the messiness of the marketplace. But pressures have mounted from all sides, whether it's Hillary Rodham Clinton scolding them for high prices or upstart generics turning the competitive screws. So, as in so much of the health care universe, times are changing. Last week, in a vivid demonstration of this shift, SmithKline Beecham said it would give $10 rebates for a month's supply of Tagamet, its big-selling ulcer drug. The company's patent on Tagamet runs out in May, and a generic version is on the way, so this could be a signal that name brands will try harder to hang onto their market. Instant Rival for Cellular Phones Wireless communications: two words that define a big slice of our future. But in the flick of an antenna, that future can take on a far different shape, as was proved last week when a relatively obscure company called Nextel Communications agreed to buy a bunch of mobile-radio licenses from Motorola for $1.8 billion in stock. Suddenly everyone looked at the numbers and realized that with the theoretical ability to serve 180 million people nationwide, Nextel had vaulted itself into a force that has to be taken very, very seriously by cellular phone companies. And Nextel, whose shares have quadrupled in a year, has an edge: In addition to voice conversations, it can offer built-in paging and data communications, which most cellular services don't offer. It faces a long, bumpy ride, though; the cellular industry has a huge head start. Going Hog-Wild Over a Chicken Some elf clearly went around Wall Street whispering \"rotisserie chicken\" in eager ears, because last week a lot of investors decided that was the place to put their money. When Boston Chicken, a franchiser, made an initial offering at $20 a share, so many investors scrambled for feathers that when trading opened, the shares more than doubled, ending at $48.50. The shares passed through a lot of hands that day: The offering had just over 2 million shares, but volume was 8.4 million. Investors' ardor cooled by Friday, and the stock slid to $39.75. Paramount Does Its Own Buying Bored with would-be buyers hammering on its door, Paramount made its own big-money acquisition last week. Paramount, which owns Simon & Schuster, agreed to pay $553 million for Macmillan, to create the world's No. 2 book publisher, after Bertelsmann. And whether it's method or madness, this adds a wrinkle to the Paramount war. The book deal is so big it already raises antitrust flags, but if QVC wins Paramount, the antitrust issue gets even thornier: Advance Publications, owner of Random House, is backing QVC. And let's not forget the latest bulletin on Paramount's dance card: BellSouth has agreed to slip $1.5 billion into QVC's pocket as QVC courts the popular studio. INTERNATIONAL Haiti's Children Pay the Price When Americans hear of the oil embargo and other sanctions against Haiti, their mental image may well be of Haiti's military rulers holed up in a bunker, isolated by rising international pressure. The reality might be far more cruel. Harvard public health experts said in a study last week that the sanctions are killing as many as 1,000 Haitian children each month. As another, less painful tack, the Administration is trying to get other nations' support for freezing overseas assets of Haiti's leaders. Starving children might prefer that. Disney's French Albatross The Walt Disney Company is probably wishing it had never tried to translate its magic formula into French. Disney is taking in plenty of money back home, but Euro Disney, clearly the victim of a sorcerer's curse, just drains away the profits. Last week, in fact, Euro Disney -- 49 percent-owned by Disney -- reported a $900 million yearly loss, dragging Disney itself into a quarterly deficit. If it doesn't get fresh cash, Euro Disney said it would face a \"liquidity problem\" (that's American for \"no money\"). While banks might fear throwing good money after bad, Disney has too much at stake to walk away. Can Japan's Doors Be Opened? Japan's economy has long been a prime American target. The goods flow out, we say, but tight regulations keep them from flowing in, giving a nasty tilt to the trade balance. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, three months in office, is determined to hack away at that regulatory wall. Last week a panel he appointed called for easing or ending hundreds of regulations, and even, in a nation built on monopolies, advocated strict application of anti-monopoly laws. So Mr. Hosokawa now has a snazzy bouquet to offer President Clinton when they meet in Seattle this week. But it remains to be seen whether he'll really be able to nudge Japan toward freer markets.", "headline": {"main": "Business Diary, November 7-12"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 1511, "_id": "4fd1ad5d8eb7c8105d6cd5a2", "snippet": "THE ECONOMY Heeeere's Al!

Years of illness had left her too weak and shaky to open each tiny pill by hand, so instead she punctured the outer coating with a hypodermic syringe. Then she squeezed each capsule gently between her forefinger and thumb until the powder spilled out in a dusty cloud. The resulting concoction was waiting in the refrigerator when Mero rang the bell, shortly after 8 on the brisk August night. Louise's mother was already there, as was the one friend, a medical assistant, who had agreed to share this intimate moment. No one but Louise had handled the pills.
