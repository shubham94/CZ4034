Researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., said Wednesday that studies with rats show extended use of cocaine can have a ''kindling'' effect that makes the brain more sensitive to the drug. The researchers, Dr. Robert Post and Dr. Susan Weiss, said the tests indicate that the brain may be more susceptible to causing lethal convulsions from repeated cocaine use than from a single large dose, which also can cause fatal seizures.", "headline": {"main": "STUDY SAYS ABUSE OF COCAINE MAY CAUSE SEIZURES"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": 463, "_id": "4fd16f0b8eb7c8105d66147c", "snippet": "The anesthetic effect of cocaine can sensitize the brain to potentially fatal seizures induced by small amounts of the drug, according to results of tests performed on animals.
