Bruce Moseley found himself engaged in an elaborate form of make-believe. Moseley had 10 patients scheduled for an operation intended to relieve the arthritis pain in their knees. The patients were men -- most of them middle-aged, all former military guys -- and they weren't ready to consign themselves to the rocking chair yet. So they had decided to take a risk and volunteer for a study that must have sounded, when Moseley first told them about it, rather peculiar. All 10 would be wheeled into an operating room at the Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center, draped, examined and anesthetized. All 10 would be dispatched to the recovery room and sent home from the hospital by the next morning equipped with crutches and a painkiller. But there the similarities ended. For while two of the men would undergo the standard arthroscopic surgery for their condition -- the scraping and rinsing of the knee joint -- and three would have the rinsing alone, five would have no recognized surgical procedure at all. Their surgery would be a placebo, an exercise in just pretend. Moseley would stab the placebo patients' knees three times with a scalpel -- to make it feel and look real, there had to be incisions and later, scars -- but that was it. And he couldn't break character. If he knew in advance which kind of surgery he was to perform, he might somehow give it away, so it wasn't until he entered the gleaming O.R., scrubbed and in his greens, that he opened an envelope telling him whether he was doing a real procedure or a fake one that time. Only the anesthetist and the nurse assisting him were in on the secret.", "headline": {"main": "The Placebo Prescription"}, "abstract": "Margaret Talbot article on the amazing healing power of placebo pills and surgery and the research into what is responsible for it; discusses calls for putting placebo effect to conscious use in clinical practice, with patients fully informed that that they are being treated with placebos; notes estimate that anywhere between 35 percent and 75 percent of patients benefit from taking a dummy pill in studies of new drugs and that the effect can go beyond subjective sensation of patients to produce actual physiological change; photos (L)", "print_page": "34", "word_count": 7833, "_id": "4fd203368eb7c8105d76920a", "snippet": "In the summer of 1994, a surgeon named J.

Although some research suggests that some supplements can produce positive health effects, there have also been cases where people have been made ill by supplements, or their conditions have become worse while they tried to use ineffective dietary supplements to treat a medical disease. Despite explosive growth in this industry, there is very little guidance or protection afforded to consumers.
