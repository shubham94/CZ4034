Children are giving up meat in record numbers, according to many local and national experts, for reasons ranging from taste to animal rights to concern for the environment. Leah Byland, a Rye Neck middle school student, is 12 and already has a long history as an outspoken vegetarian. It all began in her high chair, her parents say. Leah rejected the meat and poultry that her mother and father, Cara Tannenbaum and Bruce Byland, offered her as an infant. When a family friend put morsels of meat on her tray, the verbal 10-month-old set the record straight, exclaiming: ''No meat!''", "snippet": "AS parents and doctors around the country try to combat childhood obesity and encourage less fast-food consumption, a quiet revolution seems to be underway.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Now Playing ''AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS.'' Starring Jackie Chan and Steve Coogan. Directed by Frank Coraci. (PG, 125 minutes.) Sometimes nonsense makes good sense. The latest remake of Jules Verne's 1873 globetrotting fantasy is a deliriously silly caper that goes out of its way to thumb its nose at logic. This swatch of epic slapstick, in which three madcap adventurers from London play beat-the-clock in a race to circle the earth, is really a silent comedy with spoken subtitles. What distinguishes this rendition from the nearly three-hour 1956 version, which won the Oscar for best picture, is the presence of that coiled human whirlwind Jackie Chan. As Passepartout, the loyal valet to the fanatical British inventor Phileas Fogg (Mr. Coogan), Mr. Chan makes his entrance diving out of a window in a Keystone Kops-style chase. The whiz-bang set pieces in which he fends off teams of assailants in exotic locales are the movie's high points. The film's witty Rube Goldberg-worthy contraptions remind us that until today's high tech environment, machines used to be funny. It's refreshing and perhaps even useful to see a movie that shows how susceptible to breakdown they really are. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kathy Bates put in amusing cameos (Stephen Holden).", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film.
