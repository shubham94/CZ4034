Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 120 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). Am\u00e9lie (Ms. Tautou) is a waitress in Paris and tinkers in the lives of her friends. When she falls in love with Nino (Mr. Kassovitz), she can't be direct and let him know how she feels. Instead, she pulls him into an elaborate courtship dance that turns life in Paris into a game of Twister with a treasure hunt added to the mix. Nino trails after Am\u00e9lie, still the mystery woman to him, as she leaves clues about herself everywhere. By the climax, the movie segues into a rumination on loss and the perils of being too playful. The film's original French title was ''Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain,'' and Mr. Jeunet deflates the self-mocking pomposity of the title by the last third of the movie.

He tries his biggest vault from his past yet with the romantic triangle melodrama ''Maze,'' in which he plays Lyle Maze, a sculptor afflicted with Tourette's syndrome. Like ''King of the Jungle'' (review, Page 14), ''Maze'' is another vehicle that demonstrates how attracted actors are to playing damaged souls, and it's painful to watch Mr. Morrow's character tormented by the obscene rants and muscle seizures of his neurological disorder. But the most grating conceit attempted by Mr. Morrow -- who also directed and was a writer of the film -- is to plunge inside Lyle's head by playing out several point-of-view scenes with a jittery camera.
