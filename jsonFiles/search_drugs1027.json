Bill Richardson, President Clinton's special envoy to Zaire, persuaded Mr. Mobutu to agree to the talks. A1 The United Nations flew 186 children and 50 other refugees from Kisangani, Zaire, to Rwanda. A12 Mexico Reforms Drug Force Mexico dismantled its main anti-drug force, which was disgraced in February when its director was discovered to be working for traffickers. Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said the agency would be replaced by a new organization, to be built from a nucleus of trusted agents. President Clinton is to visit Mexico in five days. A1 Labor Leads as Campaign Ends Britain's longest election campaign since 1918 ended the way it began: with the refashioned, smoothly operating Labor Party and its leader, Tony Blair, far ahead of the ruling Conservatives in the polls and in line to take the reins of Government for the first time in 18 years. A6 Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, was expected to win a Northern Ireland seat in the British Parliament. A6 Peace Crumbling in Chechnya Russian police fought rebels in Chechnya as a tenuous peace crumbled in the separatist republic. The shooting of a local official in the nearby republic of Ingushetia and a bomb that ripped through a train station in southern Russia, killing two people and wounding 17, added to the tension; Russian officials blamed Chechen rebels in both cases. A3 U.N. Agency Head to Leave Hiroshi Nakajima, the Japanese director-general of the World Health Organization, announced that he would not seek another term in office. He had been strongly criticized by the United States and other countries for his unwillingness to cut budgets. A5 Jordan Offers Entry to Marzook Jordan said it would grant entry to Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, the Hamas leader who has been jailed in Manhattan for 22 months on accusations of terrorism and immigration violations. It was unclear whether the United States would free him, although American and Israeli officials implied that it would. A7 Clinton Satisfied on Hong Kong President Clinton said he was satisfied with the assurances on Hong Kong's future that he had received from the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen. But he said he was waiting to see if China's words matched its actions. Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, warned that China's favorable trading status depended upon its handling of the British colony's transition to Chinese rule. A8 NATIONAL A16-24, B12-15 Economy Surges, Driving U.S. Deficit Sharply Down Administration officials predicted that a surge in the economy would help drive down the Federal budget deficit this year to about $75 billion, its lowest level in more than 20 years. With balancing the budget made easier, officials said a deal between President Clinton and Congress was possible within hours. A1 The Senate tried to use a flood-relief bill to grab an advantage in the budget negotiations. President Clinton threatened to veto it. Each side accused the other of callousness toward those hurt by floods. B12 Labor Secretary Wins in Senate The Senate approved Alexis Herman as Secretary of Labor after months of delay over her role in campaign fund-raising. In return, President Clinton backed away from his plan for an executive order directing Federal agencies to consider awarding large construction projects to companies with unionized labor. A1 Exercise Fights Breast Cancer Regular exercise helps protect against breast cancer, scientists who studied more than 25,000 Norwegian women announced. More than a dozen smaller studies have found the same effect, but none were considered conclusive. A1 On Cue, Lizards Evolve An experiment with lizards showed that evolution moves in predictable ways and can occur so rapidly that changes emerge in as little as a decade or so, scientists said. The lizards, left for 14 years on different Bahamas islands, showed distinct changes to match their new environments. B14 Criticism on Veterans' Health The Government is still not doing enough to investigate the cause of health problems reported among veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, a special White House panel said. In response, the Pentagon and the C.I.A. appointed former Senator Warren B. Rudman as a special adviser on the issue. B14 Key Bombing Witness Attacked Timothy J. McVeigh's defense lawyer tried to portray Lori Fortier, a major Government witness against him, as a drug user and a liar who once hoped she and her husband could make big money by selling book and movie rights to their version of the Oklahoma City bombing. Ms. Fortier admitted having taken drugs but denied any interest in selling her story. A16 Talks Break Off in Texas The leader of an armed group claiming to represent an independent nation of Texas broke off negotiations with the state authorities who have surrounded his compound, officials said. Seventy miles away, the police arrested seven men with guns, explosives, marijuana and identity cards linking them to the group. A16 Chelsea Chooses California Chelsea Clinton decided to attend Stanford University next year. It is much farther from Washington than her other choices. B15 NEW YORK/REGION B1-10 $800 Million Surplus For New York City Mayor Giuliani said the city would finish its fiscal year with a surplus of more than $800 million. He said he would divide the money evenly between tax cuts, new spending and trying to reduce future deficits. A1 Arrest in 1963 Killing New York City detectives arrested Lawrence Henry, a 61-year-old father of five, yesterday and charged him with the 1963 murder of Lawrence J. Bart, an executive in the printing business. The police said they cracked the case with the help of a former prostitute who, having undergone a religious conversion and feeling burdened by guilt over her knowledge of the crime, came forward to identify the killer. B1 Acquittal in Abuse Case Burton N. Pugach was acquitted of charges that he had sexually abused and threatened to kill a woman after she ended a five-year affair with him. His defense witnesses included his wife, who, in 1959, was blinded when Mr. Pugach had lye thrown in her face. He was convicted then, but jurors said that record did not sway them in the new case. B3 Audits Blast Harlem Agency The Pataki administration released audit reports showing that the defunct Harlem Urban Development Corporation had received almost $100 million in state funds to help rebuild Harlem but had not produced a single major commercial project. B1 Woman Wins Top Math Prize Ioana Dumitriu, a New York University sophomore from Romania, became the first woman to win the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, the Olympics of college mathematics. The test is so difficult that half the people who take it score 2 or less of a possible 120. B1 SPORTS B17-22 Small Field for Derby Thirteen colts were entered for the 123d Kentucky Derby, the smallest field in 12 years. D. Wayne Lukas, who won the last two years, entered Deeds Not Words, a horse that has won only once in four races. B17 HOME C1-12 Bronx Conservatory Reopening The Enid A.
