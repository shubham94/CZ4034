Translated into total numbers by one group of investigators at the University of California, this means that about 140,000 babies born this year will suffer from physical abnormalities, mental retardation or learning problems, while in the late 1950's that number was about 70,000. A score of researchers who were asked for comment about the medical implications, as well as the social and economic effects, used such words as as ''serious'' and ''disturbing'' when discussing the development. Increase Noted Only Recently The potential effect on society is not yet known, since the increase has been documented only in recent months. Some medical researchers said, however, that the first suspicions of increases arose several years ago.", "snippet": "Physicians and statisticians who analyze patterns of births in the United States have concluded that the number of babies born with some physical or mental defect has doubled over the last 25 years.
