The Federal Government has become the favorite whipping boy for many analysts in their attempts to assign blame for the nation's economic problems. Particularly harsh assessments have been directed at the role of Government regulatory agencies and whether the benefits derived from regulation are worth the costs of compliance. In light of what is perceived in some circles to be a general antiregulatory mood sweeping the country, it is instructive to review the results of a recent survey conducted for the Union Carbide Corporation, ''The Vital Consensus: American Attitudes on Economic Growth,'' by a private public-opionion research firm, on the general topic of economic growth. In a national probability sample, 1,000 individuals aged 18 years and older were interviewed in October 1979. Questions focused on a variety of issues dealing with economic growth such as its desirability, factors helping and hindering growth, the linkage of growth and corporate profits, the effect of imports, and the role of the Government.
