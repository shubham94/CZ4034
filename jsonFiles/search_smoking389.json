Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. 'LESTAT' Opens April 25. Elton John and Bernie Taupin have a good track record making pop hits, but can they find success in the cursed genre of the vampire musical? Hugh Panaro stars (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, (212) 307-4100. 'THE WEDDING SINGER' Opens April 27. Stephen Lynch plays the goofy title character in this musical adaptation of the Adam Sandler film about leg warmers, Billy Idol and other artifacts from the 1980's.

Phil Collins lends his invisible touch to the score of the latest Disney musical. David Henry Hwang wrote the book (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100. Broadway 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this drama by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RING OF FIRE' The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman) * 'CYCLONE' Some skilled actors have a fine time with Ron Fitzgerald's black comedy about a young man (Hamish Linklater) who is wandering around New Jersey, carrying his father's ashes. James Hendricks, playing his neighbor, has a second-act monologue that deserves some kind of award. (2:15) Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who retailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'FAMILY SECRETS' Performing old jokes with meticulous detail, Sherry Glaser in her solo show brings to life three generations of a Jewish family (1:30). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman) 'FAHRENHEIT 451' A visceral version of Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel, staged by the Godlight Theater Company. No, firefighters don't burn books these days, but still you end up saying, ''Dang, that man had vision.'' (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger) 'FRAGMENT' Pavol Liska directs this assemblage of fragments from the lost works of Sophocles and Euripides, an ambitious venture featuring fine performances from Zachary Oberzan, Tony Torn and Juliana Francis. (1:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 677-4210.(George Hunka) 'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!' The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Hunka) 'GREY GARDENS' As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'Living Room in Africa' Bathsheba Doran's play, presented by the Edge Theater, is the disturbing but somewhat simplistic story of an English couple's attempt to start an art gallery in a remote region in Africa -- only to discover that AIDS has gotten there first (1:45). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Phoebe Hoban) 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' A solid revival of one of Shakespeare's problem plays in which the director Beatrice Terry has opted to emphasize the humor, especially in the scenes of comic relief. A staging with handsome costumes and that for the most part boasts a fine cast, whose members have made some smart choices (2:30). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Wilborn Hampton) 'mercy on the doorstep' Religious faith faces down the allied forces of alcoholism and cynicism in Gip Hoppe's drama. Laura Esterman is terrific as a gleefully unreformed libertine whose stepdaughter has found God and come to share the good news. The play itself is mostly bad news, unfortunately: meandering, repetitive and lacking in nuance (1:45). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'THE PROPERTY KNOWN AS GARLAND' Adrienne Barbeau as Judy, backstage on the night of her last concert in Copenhagen. Billy Van Zandt's play is tawdry and dull, and Ms. Barbeau's performance offers neither the minor rewards of a decent impersonation nor the guilty pleasures of an indecent one. (1:30). The Actors Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) * 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON' A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Honor Moore) 'TRIAL BY WATER' Qui Nguyen, raising worthwhile questions about how to live a humane and moral life in the real world, has based his play on the experiences of a cousin who survived a voyage of Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea that ended in murder and cannibalism. Though the actors are not able to surmount the play's unfortunate didacticism and melodrama, Clint Ramos's stunning wooden set does. (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Andrea Stevens) 'WALK THE MOUNTAIN' Jude Narita's one-woman show ''Walk the Mountain,'' about the hellish effects of the Vietnam War, offers nuanced accounts rather than a mere litany of horrors. (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.(Laura Weinert) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'BURIED CHILD' Tom Herman's revival makes something known new by revealing how close Sam Shepard's play about a dysfunctional Midwest family is to tragic opera, speechlike arias included. The Michael Chekhov Theater Company is presenting 45 Shepard plays, and this first effort sounds a positive note. (2:30) Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Stevens) '33 TO NOTHING' A band break up while playing break-up music in Grant James Varjas's comic, sometimes poignant play. Music performed by the actors. Argo Theater Company, at the Bottle Factory Theater, 195 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gwen Orel) * 'SHILOH RULES' An inventive play by Doris Baizley gets excellent treatment by the cast of six actresses. The story is set not at the Civil War Battle of Shiloh, but at a modern-day re-enactment, and by the time it's through, Ms. Baizley has served up a lot of humor and some drama, history and first-aid lessons as well. (2:05) Gene Frankel Theater, 24 Bond Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'CHRISTINE JORGENSON REVEALS' Bradford Louryk meticulously lip-syncs a fascinating hourlong interview about gender and sexuality with Ms. Jorgenson, whose sex-change operation in the 1950's was big news (1:00). The Studio Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing Saturday. (Zinoman) 'SOLDIER'S WIFE' When this play first opened on Broadway, World War II was shuddering to a close, and those on the home front wanted to feel good. Despite flaws in the work, the Mint Theater Company's revival of Rose Franken's 1944 comedy is highly entertaining (2:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231; closing Sunday.

'AQUAMARINE' (PG, 109 minutes) In this sweet comedy for the crowd that has outgrown ''The Little Mermaid,'' two likable pals (Emma Roberts and Joanna Levesque, a k a the singer JoJo) try to help a mermaid (Sara Paxton) find love and learn how to use her feet properly.(Neil Genzlinger) 'Ask the Dust' (R, 117 minutes) A story about being young and hungry -- for fame, for women, for food -- in Los Angeles during the 1930's. Robert Towne wrote and directed this adaptation of the John Fante novel, and Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek star. (Manohla Dargis) * 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden) * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott) 'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott) 'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Dargis) * 'DON'T COME KNOCKING' (R, 122 minutes) The visually majestic but dramatically inert reunion of Sam Shepard (who stars) and the director Wim Wenders, 22 years after their auspicious collaboration on ''Paris, Texas,'' might be described as a magnificent ruin. (Holden) * 'FIND ME GUILTY' (R, 124 minutes) This gripping courtroom drama, directed by Sidney Lumet, now 81 and near the top of his game, is based on the 1987-88 trial of 20 members of the New Jersey-based Lucchese crime family on multiple counts. Vin Diesel turns in a sensational performance as Giacomo DiNorscio, better known as Jackie Dee, who broke from the ranks of his fellow defendants to be his own defense lawyer. (Holden) * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis) 'LARRY THE CABLE GUY: HEALTH INSPECTOR' (PG-13, 89 minutes) Making his feature film debut, the blue-collar comedian known as Larry the Cable Guy (real name: Daniel Whitney) plays an unorthodox health inspector who is dispatched to investigate a series of food poisonings at upscale restaurants. Unpleasant, uncouth and painfully unfunny, ''Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector'' pursues its flatulence-based goals with a relentlessness that makes ''Dumb and Dumber'' seem the epitome of sophistication. (Catsoulis) * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes -- what invests their work with such terrific urgency -- is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis) 'LONESOME JIM' (R, 91 minutes) Steve Buscemi directed this deadpan comedy about a depressed 27-year-old writer (Casey Affleck) who returns from New York in defeat to his childhood home in rural Indiana and takes a job in his parents' ladder factory. (Holden) 'MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English, Mandarin and Fujian) A startling look at both the effects of globalization and a dramatic cultural divide among youth, David Redmon's documentary contrasts the lives of indulgent Americans intent on having a good time in New Orleans and hard-working Chinese factory workers who slave away to manufacture those brightly colored beads so fundamental to the Mardi Gras festivities. (Laura Kern) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) * 'SHADOW: DEAD RIOT' (No rating, 90 minutes) An experimental women's prison is overrun by zombies in this berserk little B movie, the low-budget love child of ''The Evil Dead'' and ''Reform School Girls.'' (Nathan Lee) 'SHE'S THE MAN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) ''Twelfth Night'' is recast as a hysterically peppy romantic comedy about a she-jock penetrating the boys' soccer team. Because girls can do anything boys can do, although their ultimate ambition is to put on a nice dress and go steady with a stupid jock. (Lee) '16 BLOCKS' (PG-13, 105 minutes) If Richard Donner's presence suggests that his new action flick, ''16 Blocks,'' is a throwback to the 1980's, so does one of the names holding pride of place above the title, Bruce Willis. Mr. Willis has always been an acquired taste, but for those who did acquire that taste, it's a pleasure to see him doing what comes naturally. Which means holding a gun and fending off bad guys with as few words as possible. (Dargis) * 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist in the 1940's, arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden) 'STAY ALIVE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A computer game turns out to have the power to kill things, possibly including Frankie Muniz's post-''Malcolm in the Middle'' career. The high-tech premise can't hide the horror-film clich\u00e9s. (Genzlinger) 'STONED' (No rating, 102 minutes) This docudrama follows the last weeks in the life of Brian Jones, a founding member of the Rolling Stones and an androgynous, drug-addled fop, who was found dead in his swimming pool in 1969. Hedonism on the screen has rarely looked so dull. (Holden) 'SUMMER STORM' (R, 98 minutes, in German) Yet another of those soft-core, simple-minded stories about a geeky young gay man struggling with his sexuality, this banal Bavarian import is a perfect storm of barely legal titillations and genre clich\u00e9s. (Lee) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis) 'TORO NEGRO' (No rating, 87 minutes, in Spanish) A disturbed young matador stabs animals, beats his wife and drinks himself to the edge of oblivion in this harrowing, deeply suspect documentary set in rural Mexico. (Lee) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis) 'ULTRAVIOLET' (PG-13, 80 minutes) The latest in movies structured around eyewear and abdominals, ''Ultraviolet'' stars Milla Jovovich as a genetically modified human -- part vampire, part chameleon, all model -- and one of the many victims of a government experiment to improve on nature. Directed by Kurt Wimmer with a fine eye for the preferences of 12-year-old boys, ''Ultraviolet'' cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly. (Catsoulis) 'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or a turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series ANNA MAY WONG (Through April 16) Wong, the first Chinese-American movie star, would have turned 100 last year. (She died in 1961.) The Museum of the Moving Image's extensive seven-week retrospective of her work continues this weekend with J. Elder Wills's ''Tiger Bay'' (1933), in which Wong plays a nightclub owner who protects a couple from a gang; and J. Walter Ruben's ''Java Head'' (1934), about a Chinese princess who marries an Englishman and follows him back to Bristol. 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Anita Gates) DON SIEGEL (Through April 13) Mr. Siegel, who died in 1991, was a master of several genres, including science fiction, westerns and police thrillers. Film Forum's four-week, 25-movie retrospective of his work continues this weekend with two movies about hit men: ''The Killers'' (1964), an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's story, which features a villainous Ronald Reagan in his last film role, and ''The Lineup'' (1958), with Eli Wallach and Robert Keith skulking through San Francisco. Next week's films include ''Escape From Alcatraz'' (1979), with Clint Eastwood re-enacting the prison's only successful jailbreak; ''The Shootist'' (1976), about a dying gunfighter (John Wayne in his final performance); and ''The Duel at Silver Creek'' (1952), a western starring Audie Murphy and Stephen McNally. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates) RECENT FILMS FROM DENMARK (Through April 19) Scandinavia House continues its overall Scandinavian film series with Erik Clausen's ''Villa Paranoia'' (2004), a satire about an unemployed actress, the elderly man she nurses and the son who seems a little too eager to inherit. 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. BURT BACHARACH (Monday and Tuesday) Elvis Costello's 1998 collaboration helped reveal the strange melodic contours and bitter melancholy in songs by Burt Bacharach with Hal David's lyrics, spurring a rediscovery of the composer behind ''Walk on By,'' ''The Look of Love'' and ''Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head.'' On his own, Mr. Bacharach conceals his peculiarities behind a thick gauze of easy-listening arrangements. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $75 to $150. (Jon Pareles) PIERRE BENSUSAN (Tuesday) Pierre Bensusan, an Algerian guitarist who lives in France, is a virtuoso who sings and fingerpicks his way through his own hybrids of Celtic music with Middle Eastern music, jazz and whatever else strikes his ear. 9:30 p.m., Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500; $18. (Pareles) BLACKALICIOUS (Tomorrow) Blackalicious are Bay Area rappers and associates of DJ Shadow who offer a socially conscious message with dense yet elastic flow over funky beats. The like-minded rappers Lifesavas and Fat Lip, of Pharcyde fame, open. 10:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $19.50 in advance, $22 at the door. (Laura Sinagra) TONI BRAXTON (Sunday) Toni Braxton was a great R&B diva for the 90's, with her mix of preacher's-daughter na\u00efvet\u00e9 and a kind of wounded sensuality that found its apex in the hit ''Un-break My Heart.'' 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; (212) 307-7171; $65 and $85. (Sinagra) BURNING SPEAR (Wednesday) Winston Rodney, who calls himself Burning Spear, has been a voice of conscience for Jamaican reggae since the 1970's, singing about oppression and Rastafarian faith. Yet while his messages are serious, he's also one of reggae's most ebullient singers, and as he gets older, he hasn't slowed down. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $32 in advance, $36 at the door. (Pareles) NEKO CASE, MARTHA WAINWRIGHT (Thursday) The clarion voice that's best known to many as the transcendent secret weapon of the Canadian pop group New Pornographers belongs to the alt-country chanteuse Ms. Case, who performs her own songs here. The folk singer-songwriter Martha Wainwright, like her parents -- Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III -- can be roundly sad or quippishly tart. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra) CORDERO (Tonight) Mixing the open atmospherics of the Southwest with the gritty feel of the Brooklyn art scene, the bilingual Ani Cordero (who has worked with Calexico and Giant Sand) and her band make guitar rock that gives urban brashness some borderland mystery. 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $8. (Sinagra) ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Escovedo's songs stare down loss and mortality with a mixture of unflinching memory and a rocker's defiance. Backed by a rock band merged with a trio of strings, his songs move from chamber-music delicacy to two-chord stomps, and they can be stubbornly cathartic. Tonight at 7 and 9:30., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; sold out. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $15. (Pareles) MELISSA FERRICK, ERIN MCKEOWN (Sunday) The singer-songwriter Melissa Ferrick is a folk force of nature, voicing her powerful plaints with shudder and shake. Erin McKeown has evolved since her days of spare, collegiate confessionals in the Ani DiFranco vein. Her newer material is more lushly produced, and her musing more universal. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-211; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra) THE FLAMING LIPS (Tonight and tomorrow night) The indomitable optimist and indie-rock showman Wayne Coyne and his band of Oklahoma boys continue to make good-trip psychedelia. They play here with the Pink Mountaintops. 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; both shows sold out. (Sinagra) FOLK MUSIC OF AFGHANISTAN (Tonight) The Afghan singer Vaheed Kaacemy, the scion of a renowned musical family; the lutist Quraishi; and the dohl-player Chetram Sahni perform folk songs from the many traditions of their vast country. 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 545-7536; $30 and $40; children, $26 and $35; students, $15. (Sinagra) JUAN GABRIEL (Tonight) One of Mexico's most flamboyant and crowd-pleasing singers, Mr. Gabriel writes extravagantly romantic ballads, along with songs expressing trenchant thoughts on immigration and globalization. He works with slick pop bands, mariachi groups and brass bands, sometimes all in the same marathon concert. 8, the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $69.50 to $139.50. (Pareles) DAVID GILMOUR (Tuesday and Wednesday) This erstwhile Pink Floyd lead guitarist has a rock-god following of his own, and as he tours here behind his solo album, ''On an Island'' (Columbia), written with his wife, expect some deep dives into the Floyd catalog. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 632-4000; $64.50 to $154.60. (Sinagra) Gorillaz: ''DEMON DAYS LIVE'' (Sunday though Thursday) Damon Albarn, the wizard behind the animated rock band Gorillaz, has organized a star-laden cast to help him perform the group's latest album, the eerie but elevating rock-hop ''Demon Days'' in its entirety. That cast includes De La Soul, Ike Turner, Shaun Ryder, Roots Manuva, Martina Topley-Bird, Neneh Cherry and the Pharcyde's Bootie Brown. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; all shows sold out. (Sinagra) HARD-FI (Tomorrow) Using dub tactics like ominous echoes and faraway sirens to add dimension to its paranoid but melodic punk sound, this British band creates a more cavernous and even cinematic space than most. 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $16. (Sinagra) KID ROCK (Tonight) A couple of Sheryl Crow duets and a recent cameo in an unauthorized sex tape haven't done a whole heck of a lot to renew interest in the Kid or his Southern-fried, Rust Belt rap-boogie. But he still likes to have trashy fun in his tank top, and the tour bus rolls on. 7, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882; $50. (Sinagra) GLENN KOTCHE, TEDDY THOMPSON (Tonight) The Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche's new solo CD, ''Mobile'' (Nonesuch), finds him exploring questing realms of melodic percussion while still keeping a firm grip on the musical math. The British folk-rocker Teddy Thompson looks to distinguish himself from his parents, Richard and Linda, while still honoring their legacy. His baritone voice sounds like his father's without the bite, not always a bad thing. 7, Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; $17.50 (Sinagra) SONDRE LERCHE (Thursday) Since making an indie cabaret-rock splash in 2002, this Norwegian guitarist and crooner's music has suggested life experience beyond his tender years. Lately he has taken a break from the baroque, applying his breathy yet urgent voice to a batch of lighthearted, stripped-down jazzy tunes. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sinagra) MASTERS OF INDIAN MUSIC (Tomorrow) The South Indian singer Sanjay Subramaniam began honing his intense voice as a young child, graduating early to the concert hall circuit. He will be accompanied by the violinist Nagai Muralidharan, the barrel drum percussionist Guruvayur Dorai and the tambourine player Neyveli Venkatesh. 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26; $22 for children; $15 for students. (Sinagra) THE ORB (Tomorrow) In the 90's, the Orb's ambient house music made it one of the most popular mind-warp rave soundtracks. 7:30 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; $26. (Sinagra) THE PRETENDERS (Tomorrow) Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders is certainly a foremother of tough-but-tender rock chicks like Eleanor Friedburger and Karen O. Her Akron via England attitude comes across forcefully on hits like ''Brass in Pocket'' and ''Middle of the Road.'' 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sinagra) RYE COALITION (Tonight and tomorrow) Rye Coalition began as an angular rock band in the style of Fugazi but now mixes in more elements of 70's hard rock. This weekend the group screens a DVD about its struggles before each performance. Tonight at 10, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. Tomorrow at 5:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; ticket price not available. (Sinagra) SASHA and JOHN DIGWEED (Tonight) Sasha and Digweed have been the dominant D.J.'s in trance techno throughout its global rollout. They reunite tonight as a duo. 10, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000; $40 to $60. (Sinagra) SERENA MANEESH (Tomorrow) This Norwegian band takes a lighthearted approach to distorted, textured rock blare. Its alternately screeching and orchestral atmospherics are mismatched with its vocal purr and squawk. 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sinagra) SAVES THE DAY (Tonight) More in the Death Cab for Cutie vein of contemplative emo rock than in the glut of full-on ''screamo'' bands that followed it onto the scene, Saves the Day returns to claim its place. 8, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sinagra) SHE WANTS REVENGE, NIGHTMARE OF YOU (Tuesday) She Wants Revenge plays post-punk in the dark Interpol style. Chances are good the group will be upstaged by the opener, Nightmare of You, a lean and muscular group whose live show is more convincing than its recordings. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sinagra) SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR (Tomorrow and Sunday) Gospel music and traditional South African harmonies and rhythms have found common ground and hybrid possibilities since Christian missionaries arrived in South Africa in the 19th century. This 32-member choir carries the fusion toward jubilation, performing traditional songs (and ''Mbube,'' the Zulu song better known as ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight''), alongside gospel messages. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $45. Family concert on Sunday at 1 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $8. (Pareles) THE STILLS (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Stills continue to sound like Strokes-era guitar rock, but they've gotten away from their initial dark new wave and moved in the direction of gutsy bar-band revelation. 9:45 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; sold out. (Sinagra) GLENN TILBROOK (Tonight) Glenn Tilbrook, of the 80's melodic poppers Squeeze, continues his erstwhile band's quirky, hooky music, this time taking a crack at lyric-writing. 10, Coda, 34 East 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-3434; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra) WHAT I LIKE ABOUT JEW (Thursday) The cabaret-rock comedians Sean Altman and Rob Tannenbaum might be giants of Jewish joke-pop, but you can also hear some Beatles in their risqu\u00e9 borscht-belting. They play here with a full band, made up of members of Loser's Lounge. 7 and 9:30 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, SoHo, (212) 941-8100; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden) * Barbara Cook (Tonight and tomorrow night) This Broadway legend is loose, down-home and, as always, magnificent, singing a 25-year retrospective of songs she has performed at the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle. 8:45 and 10:45, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $85; dinner required at the 8:45 shows. (Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) * KT Sullivan and Mark Nadler (Tonight and tomorrow night) In the words of Cole Porter, whose songs are performed here by a ripened Botticelli Venus and a reincarnation of Danny Kaye, ooh-la-la-la, c'est magnifique. 9 and 11:30, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $50 cover, with a $50 prix fixe dinner (required at the early shows), or a $20 minimum. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. CANNONBALL ADDERLEY LEGACY BAND (Tuesday through April 9) Cannonball Adderley was an alto saxophonist who balanced bebop's harmonic precision with homegrown grit and soul. This tribute, led by his former drummer Louis Hayes, features Vincent Herring on alto saxophone, as well as the singer Paula West and the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11 p.m. set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (For NYC & Company discount, (212) 484-1222.) (Nate Chinen) ANDY BEY (Tomorrow) Intimacy is a hallmark of Mr. Bey's vocal style, which alternates between a rich baritone and a burnished falsetto. He's also a fine pianist, as he'll surely demonstrate with his quartet here, on a concert stage in his old hometown. 7:30 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, www.njpac.org; $37. (Chinen) STEFANO BOLLANI TRIO/FRANCESCO CAFISO QUARTET (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Bollani, a pianist with extensive pop credentials, recently gave a fine performance on an album with the trumpeter Enrico Rava and the drummer Paul Motian; Mr. Cafiso, a teenage alto saxophone prodigy, just released a self-assured album called ''Happy Time'' (Cam).

(Chinen) JOE CHAMBERS BAND (Thursday and next Friday) Mr. Chambers, a veteran drummer with a gliding sense of swing, leads a hard-bop group featuring two good saxophonists -- Vincent Herring on alto and Javon Jackson on tenor -- as well as the versatile pianist Joanne Brackeen. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) DUDUKA DA FONSECA SEXTET (Through Sunday) On his new album, ''Samba Jazz in Black & White'' (Zoho), the percussionist Duduka Da Fonseca devises an ebullient small-group concept inspired by the sounds of his native Brazil. His ensemble includes the singer Maucha Adnet, the guitarist Vic Juris, and Paulo Levi or Anat Cohen on reeds. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50 to $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) JORRIT DIJKSTRA AND JOHN HOLLENBECK (Wednesday) Mr. Dijkstra, an alto saxophonist from Amsterdam, and Mr. Hollenbeck, a percussionist from upstate New York, have been working as a duet for years, with an emphasis on extraordinary textures and extended techniques. This electro-acoustic performance precedes the release of a new album, ''Sequence'' (Trytone). 8 p.m., Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) ROY HARGROVE BIG BAND (Tuesday) Mr. Hargrove, the trumpeter, has been a paragon of small-group hard bop since the early 1990's. But he has also led a big band, on and off, for roughly the same span of time; he recently rekindled the format here, with powerful results. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $30. (Chinen) HIGHLIGHTS IN JAZZ (Thursday) The longest-running jazz series in the city advances what it calls the Ultimate Jam Session, with David (Fathead) Newman and Ernie Andrews on saxophones, Steve Turre on trombone, Lew Soloff on trumpet, Mulgrew Miller on piano and Jimmy Cobb on drums. 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 220-1460; $30.00. (Chinen) THE JAZZ PASSENGERS (Monday) Since being formed almost 20 years ago by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson and the trombonist Curtis Fowlkes, this ensemble has fashioned a colorful m\u00e9lange of retro pop, post-bop and ironic show-biz shtick. In addition to Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Fowlkes, the group includes Bill Ware on vibraphone, Sam Bardfeld on violin, Brad Jones on bass and E. J. Rodriguez on drums. 9:30 p.m., Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) TONY MALABY TRIO (Tonight) Mr. Malaby, a versatile and increasingly prominent tenor saxophonist, convenes a promising exploratory trio with Marcus Rojas on tuba and John Hollenbeck on drums and percussion. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village,(212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) DONNY McCASLIN GROUP (Tuesday) As he does on ''Soar'' (Sunnyside), a noteworthy new album, the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin applies his extroverted style to a Latin American-inspired contemporary fusion, benefiting greatly from the contributions of the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Scott Colley and the percussionists Antonio Sanchez and Pernell Saturnino. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen) MEDESKI MARTIN & WOOD (Thursday) The pianist John Medeski, the drummer Billy Martin and the bassist Chris Wood make up this trio, which usually traffics in the kind of groove music once practiced by the Meters and Eddie Harris. This concert finds the group playing in an all-acoustic vein, the setting that most exposes their avant-garde proclivities. 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $35 to $40. (Chinen) JASON MORAN AND THE BANDWAGON (Tonight) Mr. Moran is a bright pianist who favors a jagged and delirious sort of polyphony; his group, the Bandwagon, features the earthy yet slippery rhythm team of Tarus Mateen, bassist, and Nasheet Waits, drummer. 8, Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts, One University Place, Long Island University, Flatbush Avenue Extension and DeKalb Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4181, ext. 2229, or www.651arts.org; $25. (Chinen) PAUL MOTIAN QUARTET (Tuesday through April 9) The teasingly suggestive drumming of Mr. Motian is just one of several enigmas posed by this ensemble, which is also distinguished by the tightly coiled alto saxophone scribbles of Greg Osby and the abstruse pianism of Masabumi Kikuchi. Larry Grenadier, on bass, serves a welcome clarifying purpose. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) * DAVID MURRAY QUARTET/ODEAN POPE SAXOPHONE CHOIR (Tuesday through April 9) In terms of sheer saxophone bluster, it would be tough to conjure a weightier double bill than this one, which pairs the avant-garde tenor titan David Murray (with Lafayette Gilchrist on piano, Jaribu Shahid on bass and Hamid Drake on drums) and the Odean Pope Saxophone Choir (nine saxophones, including Mr. Pope, and a rhythm section). 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) KRESTEN OSGOOD TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Osgood, an energetic young Danish drummer, nominally leads this group with the guitarist Michael Gregory Jackson and the alto saxophonist Oliver Lake, but the power of Mr. Lake's instrumental voice may tip the scales in another direction. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO (Wednesday) Mr. Pilc's piano playing has a joyous bounce, no matter how dark or furious the extemporization; he's at his best in the company of assertive partners like the electric bassist Richard Bona and the drummer Clarence Penn, who join him here. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen) BOB REYNOLDS QUINTET (Wednesday) Mr. Reynolds is a self-assured tenor saxophonist and an unassuming yet effective composer, as he proves on ''Can't Wait for Perfect'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), a sturdy new debut. He's joined here by some of the musicians on the album, including the pianist Aaron Goldberg, the guitarist Mike Moreno and the bassist Reuben Rogers. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen) SCOTT ROBINSON (Tonight) Outer space and early swing are equal preoccupations for the multireedist Mr. Robinson, who is best known as a stalwart sideman. Here he applies his unique view of jazz repertory toward an expansive small-group performance. 7 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344, www.rmanyc.org; $15. (Chinen) ELLIOT SHARP'S LIMBIC TRIO (Tomorrow) Mr. Sharp, a saxophonist and polyglot experimentalist, introduces an ensemble with Kevin Ray on bass and Donald McKenzie on drums. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) JAMES (BLOOD) ULMER (Tonight and tomorrow night) The guitarist and singer James (Blood) Ulmer fashions an oddly hypnotic combination of influences: Ornette Coleman's polytonality crossed with the psychedelic swagger of Jimi Hendrix. Here, as on a 2001 album called ''Memphis Blood: The Sun Sessions'' (Hyena), he focuses on the blues, in a seven-piece ensemble organized by a kindred spirit, the experimental rock guitarist Vernon Reid. 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30. (Chinen) WHAT IS JAZZ? (Wednesday) This unanswerable question comes courtesy of Ropeadope Records, as do the stirrings of the funk-infused Christian McBride Band; the soul-inspired Charlie Hunter Trio; the cut-and-paste groove of DJ Logic; and the dynamic solo percussion of Bobby Previte. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; cover, $20. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'LA BOH\u00c8ME' (Tomorrow and Thursday) James Robinson's production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. At the first performance, Kelly Kaduce made an appealing Mimi, pairing her character's physical weakness with focused vocal strength. Gerard Powers sang Rodolfo with a solid top but a thinner middle range. For Thursday's performance, a new cast comes in with Yunah Lee (Mimi), Jennifer Black (Musetta) and Phillip Torre (Marcello). Steven White conducts tomorrow, David Wroe on Thursday. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 remaining tomorrow; $16 to $120 on Thursday. (Jeremy Eichler) 'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Amato's venerable recipe -- no rehearsals, changing casts at every performance -- should make for an unusual version of Mozart's classic dish, but at least the theater's small scale represents a kind of period fidelity. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) 'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Neither objectionable nor particularly fresh or insightful, Harold Prince's 1989 staging of this great Mozart opera is a good, basic presentation of the work. The company's opening cast includes Christopher Schaldenbrand in the title role; Robert Gierlach as Leporello; Hanan Alattar as Zerlina; Orla Boylan as Donna Anna and Elizabeth Caballero as Donna Elvira. Steven Mosteller conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 remaining tomorrow; $16 to $120 on Tuesday. (Allan Kozinn) * 'DON PASQUALE' (Tonight and Monday) Why mount a new production of a frothy opera buffa? At the Met this weekend, the answer is: hot young stars. Anna Netrebko is the soprano of the moment; Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez, the best lyric tenor around; Mariusz Kwiecien, a fine baritone. They look good and they should sound great. Tonight at 8, Monday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 to $250 remaining tonight; sold out on Monday. (Midgette) * 'FIDELIO' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) J\u00fcrgen Flimm's strikingly contemporary and deeply humane production of Beethoven's ''Fidelio,'' which opened at the Met in 2000, is back. So is the soprano Karita Mattila, who gives a courageous and vocally radiant portrayal of Leonore, opera's most valiant and devoted wife. The conductor Paul Nadler has taken over for James Levine, who has withdrawn for the rest of the season, and though Mr. Nadler is no Levine, he does honorable work. All in all, this production still delivers. And Ms. Mattila is astonishing. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $220 remaining tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LUISA MILLER' (Tomorrow) Because of illness, there have been more substitutions in this run of ''Luisa'' than in the ninth inning of a spring training baseball game. But Veronica Villarroel and Neil Shicoff, the original leads, are both scheduled to sing this final performance, along with the solid if uninflected baritone Carlos Alvarez and, in lieu of James Morris, the fine bass Vitalij Kowaljow. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $220. (Midgette) 'LYSISTRATA' (Tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) Mark Adamo's fantastical operatic adaptation of Aristophanes' antiwar comedy had its premiere last year at the Houston Grand Opera. That production is now at the New York City Opera. Mr. Adamo's score is bustling and hyper-rhythmic, but sometimes too dense. Still, he takes seriously the story of Athenian and Spartan women who join forces to refuse their husbands and lovers sex until the men stop waging a seemingly endless war. At its best, the opera becomes a somber meditation on the intertwining of passion and aggression. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 731-6500; $16 to $120 tomorrow and Wednesday; $45 remaining on Sunday. (Tommasini) 'MANON' (Wednesday) The news is Ren\u00e9e Fleming, who returns to a signature role in the venerable but appealing production by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, along with the tenor Massimo Giordano, under the baton of Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez-Cobos. Not news is the length of this grand opera; after hearing an opera by Massenet, a notable dramatic soprano is supposed to have said, ''And they say Wagner is long?'' 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out. (Midgette) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Thursday) The Met's re-energized production of this Verdi opera continues its long run with Hei-Kyung Hong as Violetta, Frank Lopardo as Alfredo and Dwayne Croft as Germont. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6200; sold out. (Bernard Holland) Classical Music S\u00c9RGIO AND ODAIR ASSAD (Sunday) This Brazilian guitar duo touches on a wide variety of music, which ranges from Alb\u00e9niz and Rodrigo to the contemporary Cuban composer Leo Brouwer to jazz-tinged works by Egberto Gismonti. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Kozinn) JONATHAN BISS (Sunday) The Peoples' Symphony Concerts presents recitals by big-name artists and up-and-coming players for as little as the cost of a movie. This weekend, it's the young American pianist Jonathan Biss performing Janacek, Schumann and Beethoven, as well as a recent work by Lewis Spratlan called ''Wonderer.'' 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680; $9 and $11. (Eichler) BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) Michael Christie, the orchestra's new music director, has assembled a compelling slate of programs for his first season. The second of them looks at this year's two anniversary celebrants, Mozart and Shostakovich, both directly -- by way of Shostakovich's Symphony for Strings and Mozart's ''King Thamos'' -- as well as through the eyes of Alfred Schnittke, whose amusing ''Moz-Art \u00e0 la Haydn'' opens the concert. 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $60; $10 for students. (Kozinn) CHAMBER MUSIC AT THE Y (Tuesday and Wednesday) The baritone Nathaniel Webster performs Ned Rorem's ''Aftermath,'' written in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Ravel's Violin Sonata and Brahms's G minor Piano Quartet fill out the program courtesy of Jaime Laredo, Cynthia Phelps, Sharon Robinson and Joseph Kalichstein. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Eichler) ALICE COOTE (Sunday) This British mezzo-soprano, best known for her performances and recordings of early music, makes her Met debut later this month as Cherubino in ''Le Nozze di Figaro.'' But those who want an early glimpse of Ms. Coote's artistry can hear her in a recital of songs by Mahler and Schubert. 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $48. (Tommasini) JEROME L. GREENE CONCERT (Tonight) Daniel Beckwith conducts an ensemble of Juilliard students in an all-Handel program. 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Eichler) QUINN KELSEY (Sunday) This young Hawaiian-born baritone, who has been coming up through the young artist program at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, sings a recital as part of the ''On Wings of Song'' series, sponsored by the Marilyn Horne Foundation. His intriguingly titled program, ''Songs of Separation,'' offers works by Beethoven, Barber, Faur\u00e9 and Mussorgsky. 3 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 51st Street, (212) 378-0248; $20; $15 for 65+; free for students. (Tommasini) * YUNDI LI (Monday) Murray Perahia was to have given a recital at Carnegie Hall on this night, but when he withdrew, Carnegie turned to this fantastic young Chinese pianist, who will play Mozart's Sonata in C, Schumann's ''Carnaval'' and the Liszt Sonata in B minor, a work he plays brilliantly on his first Deutsche Grammophon CD. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $97. (Kozinn) * yO-YO MA (Wednesday) Mr. Ma plays three of Bach's six solo works for the cello. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out. (Holland) NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Thursday) It's nice when a major performer plays a new work; it's even nicer when he likes it enough to keep on playing it. The pianist Emanuel Ax has certainly taken to the concerto Melinda Wagner wrote for him, called ''Extremity of Sky,'' enough that he's played it a number of times since its first performance with the Chicago Symphony in 2003, and is now giving its first New York performance. Leonard Slatkin and the National Symphony will also offer ''Medea's Meditation and Dance of Vengeance,'' a ballet Samuel Barber wrote for Martha Graham, and Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $24 to $85. (Midgette) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight) This one-time Philharmonic program conducted by Lorin Maazel offers works by Brahms, Kodaly and Dvorak. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $92. (Holland) VADIM REPIN AND NIKOLAI LUGANSKY (Sunday) Two Eastern European virtuosos, the violinist Vadim Repin and the pianist Nikolai Lugansky, play Bartok, Schubert, P\u00e4rt and Franck. 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $56. (Holland) * ST. THOMAS CHOIR (Tuesday) This excellent choir, led by John Scott, performs Bach's ''St. John Passion.'' The soloists are Mark Bleeke, Craig Phillips and Christopher Trueblood. With the Concert Royal. 7:30 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360; $25 to $60. (Eichler) SKAMPA STRING QUARTET (Tonight) Having just played as part of the Peoples' Symphony Concerts, this busy ensemble of young musicians from Prague comes to Weill Recital Hall. In an interesting stroke, excerpts from John Adams's impish homage to dance rhythms in classical music, ''John's Book of Alleged Dances,'' will come between quartets by Mozart and Beethoven. 7:30, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $42. (Tommasini) MASAAKI SUZUKI (Tomorrow) A prophet of period-instrument Bach in Japan, Mr. Suzuki led his Bach Collegium Japan in a concert earlier in the week, but tomorrow he has the stage to himself for what promises to be a revelatory harpsichord performance of Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier,'' Book II. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38. (Kozinn) TALLIS SCHOLARS (Tomorrow) The rock stars of Renaissance vocal music (well, figuratively), the members of this a cappella ensemble return to New York in a program of 16th-century polyphony, exploring ''Mozart's Roots,'' that includes Praetorius, Sch\u00fctz and, of course, Bach. 8 p.m., Riverside Church Nave, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $35. (Midgette) * WU MAN (Thursday) The pipa, a Chinese lute, has been finding a place in Western classical music in recent years, not only through the works of Chinese composers, but also at Bang on a Can marathons and in concerts by the Kronos Quartet. Often, in New York shows, the instrument is played by Wu Man, a virtuoso offering a concert as part of Kronos's series at Carnegie Hall. With an ensemble including a banjo, dulcimer, Ukrainian zither, African harp and percussion, Ms. Wu offers a program that includes Chinese traditional music, bluegrass tunes and new works by Eric Moe, Chen Yi and Julian Kytasty. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35. (Kozinn) YOUNG CONCERT ARTiSTS (Wednesday) Every year, as part of its benefit gala, this organization presents its talented young prizewinners in various concertos with a full orchestra. This year, a Chinese double-bassist named DaXun Zhang will perform, improbably enough, ''Carmen Fantasy,'' originally a violin showpiece. Lise de la Salle, a French pianist, will perform Liszt's Concerto No. 1, and Jose Franch-Ballester, a Spanish clarinetist, will play Copland's Clarinet Concerto. Keith Lockhart leads the Orchestra of St. Luke's. 7:30 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 307-6656; $25 to $35. (Eichler) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

Museums * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. Her works do not lend themselves to easy deciphering, but her magic with materials and her daring compositional imagination draw you in. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Roberta Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. One of the most interesting concerns the genteel technique of cut-paper silhouette that is the basis of Ms. Walker's scathing take-no-prisoners exploration of slavery and its tragic legacy. (See above.) (Smith) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff) NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work, from his dense, Cubist-style oil, ''When God Considered the Creation of the Plants'' (1913), to a beautifully stylized rendering of the jazz singer and dancer Josephine Baker (1927) to labyrinthine compositions like ''Or the Mocked Mocker'' (1930). 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck) P.S. 1: Jessica Stockholder: 'Of Standing Float Roots in Thin Air,' through May 1. A soaring, cannily designed installation -- made of airborne plastic bins, electric lights, orange extension cords and an old armchair topping a wooden tower -- by a sculptor known for orchestrating productive collisions of formalism and consumerism. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Ken Johnson) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. Beauty is hard to come by. Check out, among other things, Paul Chan's digital animation of shadowy objects like cellphones and bicycles, floating upward, Wizard of Oz-like, while bodies tumble down, the work cast as if it were light from a tall window slanting onto the floor of a dark room. And also Pierre Huyghe's film, shot in Antarctica and Central Park. It's really gorgeous: crosscut between day and night, fiction and reality, it encapsulates the show's operative but ultimately airy metaphor about the slippery state of art now. (''Day for Night'' is the biennial's first-ever title, after the Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut film.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) Galleries: Uptown Tony Cragg: 'Five Bottles' In the early 1980's, this eminent English sculptor made flat, mosaiclike works out of found colored plastic objects and fragments. This show presents a set of five wall-works, each representing a different giant colored bottle composed of toys, combs, cigarette lighters and other pieces of ordinary commercial detritus. Vivian Horan, 35 East 67th Street, (212) 517-9410, through April 21. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea * MARK LECKeY: 'DRUNKEN BAKERS' This cinematically gifted British artist raises his game with a stop-action animation made by simply shooting a raunchy, well-drawn comic strip for adults in close-up, turning its speech balloons into spoken dialogue and adding realistic sound effects. Shown in an increasingly grubby white-on-white cube, the work is elegantly efficient, funny and dark, and adds another twist to the convoluted history of appropriation art. GBE@Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, (212) 627-5258, through April 22. (Smith) Other Galleries 'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Fran\u00e7oise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson) Last Chance * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; closes tomorrow. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750; closes Monday. (Johnson) * DAVID HAMMONS: 'SELECTED WORKS' A rare exhibition of 11 objects and drawings highlights the robust tactility and sculptural intelligence in this elusive, influential artist's work. His use of eccentric discarded materials and found objects goes beyond Duchampian gesture to comment pointedly, but with elegance and wit, on poverty, deprivation and the ingenuity they can engender. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677; closes tomorrow. (Smith) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA' This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original F\u00e9lix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200; closes Sunday.(Edward Rothstein) * KEIZO KITAJIMA: 'NEW YORK' The New York debut of this Japanese photographer consists of more than three dozen pictures taken during a six-month sojourn in New York in 1981. His subjects include immigrants, drag queens and club kids, celebrities and nascent celebrities, all portrayed with a magnetic combination of glamour, grit and gravitas. Cohen Amador Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 759-6740; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines' Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, closes Sunday. (Kimmelman) Rachel Whiteread: 'Bibliography' Cardboard boxes cast in plaster are displayed in monotonous profusion singly and in groups by this British sculptor who once made a concrete cast of the inside of a whole house. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100; closes tomorrow.
