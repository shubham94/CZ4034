The drug benefit is projected to cost $400 billion over the first 10 years and perhaps $1.5 trillion or more over the following decade. Without cost restraint, it will impose huge financial burdens on future generations. At Republican insistence, the drug benefit was designed to avoid any possibility of the federal government using its bulk-purchasing power to demand low prices. That sets drugs apart from the rest of the Medicare program, which routinely dictates low prices for reimbursing hospitals and doctors for the services they provide. The drug program will rely instead on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate good prices. Those companies will have more bargaining clout than an individual elderly person but far less than the federal government. Unfortunately, their loyalties are suspect. Some big pharmacy benefit companies have been accused of taking rebates from manufacturers to promote their most expensive drugs over cheaper alternatives.", "headline": {"main": "Holding Down Drug Prices"}, "abstract": "Editorial says that now that Congress has passed costly prescription drug plan for older Americans, it is imperative to find strong tools for restraining drug costs; notes drug benefit is expected to cost $400 billion over first 10 years and perhaps $1.5 trillion or more over follwing decade; contends without cost restraint, it will impose huge financial burdens on future generations", "print_page": "42", "word_count": 546, "_id": "4fd231bf8eb7c8105d7c12ae", "snippet": "Now that Congress has passed a costly prescription drug benefit for older Americans -- a bill that we endorsed to close a glaring gap in Medicare -- it is imperative to find strong tools for restraining drug costs.
