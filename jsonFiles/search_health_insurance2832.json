Their youngest children, a giddy pair of elementary-schoolers, rushed in and out of the room. Their teenage daughter chattered about her ''cheerleading skills.'' Even the 17-year-old Deen made an appearance, slouching up from the basement to pick at leftovers from dinner. It seemed a storybook image of the American immigrant dream. But across the room, in low voices so the kids couldn't hear, Kaprr spoke about the circumstances threatening to break up his family. Kaprr and Titia have been living in the United States for 13 years. By the time they moved into this house five years ago, they had legal status, steady jobs, a growing family, night-school degrees well under way and a mortgage. Despite appearances, though, Kaprr and Titia are not Americans, or even on a certain path to citizenship. Rather, they are among at least 2,700 Sierra Leoneans living and working legally across the United States who face deportation unless they leave the country by May 3.", "headline": {"main": "The Way We Live Now: 5-2-04: Phenomenon; Exit Date"}, "abstract": "Douglas McGray article on family of illegal immigrants from Sierra Leone who face deportation; in 1997, US granted all Sierra Leoneans living within its borders temporary protection status, designed to protect refugees who cannot benefit from asylum laws; status grants right to work and live in US legally but not citizenship and is renewable annually depending on crisis in country of origin; temporary status is ending for Sierra Leonians and, with three children born in US who are citizens, family is mired in complex and uncertain situation; photo (L)", "print_page": "26", "word_count": 3066, "_id": "4fd23aa28eb7c8105d7cf267", "snippet": "On a snowy January evening, in the kitchen of a powder blue colonial at the end of a still, winding block in the suburbs of Washington, Titia and her husband, Kaprr, two immigrants from Sierra Leone, enjoyed a rare family evening together.

It is a drug discount card that is supposed to reduce drug prices by 10 to 25 percent for cardholders as a stopgap measure until the full prescription drug benefit kicks in on Jan. 1, 2006. How great the savings will turn out to be in practice is a matter of conjecture, but the cards will at least provide a projected seven million beneficiaries with group purchasing power like that long marshaled by big health insurance plans. The greatest benefits will go to those on low incomes (below about $12,500 for individuals and $16,800 for couples). They will get a $600 annual subsidy plus a discount on purchases above that. The value of the cards to people with higher incomes is less clear. One recent analysis by Harvard researchers estimated that the average beneficiary might get a 17 percent reduction from standard retail prices, thus saving some $240 on a typical annual drug bill of $1,400. That is some help, but hardly enough for people struggling to pay the high cost of their medicines. Of course, some elderly Americans already get senior discounts at their drugstores or buy drugs through Internet pharmacies with discounts that look comparable to those that will be available with the new cards, so the gains for them may be negligible.", "headline": {"main": "The New Drug Discount Cards"}, "abstract": "Editorial contends that Medicare drug discount cards that Americans will be able to sign up for starting May 3 are too weak a weapon to have much impact on upward rise of prescription drug costs; holds that they simply offer discount from prices that seem out of control", "print_page": "14", "word_count": 428, "_id": "4fd29f628eb7c8105d882e0c", "snippet": "Elderly and disabled Americans will be able to sign up starting Monday for the first tangible benefit to emerge from the Medicare prescription drug program approved by Congress last year.
