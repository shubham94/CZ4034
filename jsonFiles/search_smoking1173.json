Out-of-court settlements of most of the suits will begin only after a pattern of acquittals or convictions with the award of damages emerges in further trials, one of the lawyers, Matthew Shafner of Groton, said. But defense counsels say they hope the first acquittal will set a trend for the cases to come, which have similarities. All of the cases name the same defendants, allege the same negligence on their part, and seek $1.23 million per person in damages. Another 50 cases were settled out of court for $6 million in 1980 and 1981. Electric Boat is not a defendant because, under the Federal Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act of 1972, it can settle cases of occupational disability with a ''no fault'' compensation fund.", "snippet": "ATTORNEYS say they will continue to press 300 complaints brought by workers at the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton against asbestos manufacturers and suppliers - despite the acquittal Monday of the same defendants in the first of the suits.  ..."}, {"word_count": 460, "slideshow_credits": null, "multimedia": [], "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "pub_date": "1982-03-12T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/12/opinion/l-science-acadmey-s-clear-warning-on-marijuana-246677.html", "blog": [], "_id": "4fd121308eb7c8105d5e2d66", "headline": {"main": "SCIENCE ACADMEY'S CLEAR WARNING ON MARIJUANA"}, "subsection_name": null, "abstract": null, "section_name": "Opinion", "byline": null, "print_page": "28", "document_type": "article", "type_of_material": "Letter", "keywords": [{"value": "DRUG ADDICTION AND ABUSE", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH", "name": "subject"}], "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: I am concerned that your front-page article of Feb. 27 summarizing the National Academy of Sciences Report on marijuana and health, ''Study Reaffirms General Doubts Over Marijuana,'' will have an unfortunate impact on the nation's teen-agers. he headline and the lead paragraph in your story emphasize that conclusive evidence is not yet at hand with regard to many possible chronic health effects of marijuana use.
