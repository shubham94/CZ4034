The supermarkets say they are forced to lower their labor costs to compete with Wal-Mart, a nonunion, low-wage employer aggressively moving into the grocery business. Everyone should be concerned about this fight. It is, at bottom, about the ability of retail workers to earn wages that keep their families out of poverty. Grocery stores in Southern California are bracing for the arrival, in February, of the first of 40 Wal-Mart grocery supercenters. Wal-Mart's prices are about 14 percent lower than other groceries' because the company is aggressive about squeezing costs, including labor costs. Its workers earn a third less than unionized grocery workers, and pay for much of their health insurance. Wal-Mart uses hardball tactics to ward off unions. Since 1995, the government has issued at least 60 complaints alleging illegal anti-union activities.", "headline": {"main": "The Wal-Martization of America"}, "abstract": "Editorial says Wal-Mart's entry into Southern California grocery business is driving battle between grocery stores and striking workers; says it is threatening to force workers into poverty and urges consumers to make voice heard by reminding Wal-Mart that American values include paying workers enough to provide for their families", "print_page": "12", "word_count": 451, "_id": "4fd29b058eb7c8105d87a963", "snippet": "The 70,000 grocery workers on strike in Southern California are the front line in a battle to prevent middle-class service jobs from turning into poverty-level ones.
