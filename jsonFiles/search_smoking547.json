Wall Street Didn't Do It A few weeks ago, on ''Moneyline,'' a guest who didn't fully understand just how much times have changed invoked some corporation's ability to beat Wall Street's forecasts for its quarterly earnings. Before you could say ''market manipulation,'' the program's host, Lou Dobbs, said, ''Do you really think anybody's paying attention to that silly expectation stuff anymore?'' He dismissed forecasts as ''the game of the late 90's.'' And he had a point. For many years, Wall Street analysts have low-balled their earnings estimates so that their corporate customers could announce to the press that they had ''beaten'' those estimates. This particular game was exposed beginning in the late 1990's by fledgling Web sites, which routinely published more accurate earnings forecasts than the Wall Street pros. By the middle of 1998 the stock market began to trade off the Web estimates rather than the Street estimates -- which tells you how fully understood this quarterly forecast game had become even before the boom reached its turn-of-the-century heights. But so long as the stock market rose, Lou Dobbs was happy to listen to Wall Street and corporate big shots blather on about how they had beaten their earnings forecasts. He didn't scorn them; like every other serious reporter, he treated them as useful informants (when he wasn't distracted by his bid to make his Internet fortune in a doomed start-up called Space.com). And yet now, somehow, Lou Dobbs, like every other serious reporter, knows enough to raise his eyebrows and harshen his tone when anyone mentions earnings estimates. As wide-eyed as he was three years ago, he is narrow-eyed now. You can't put one over Lou Dobbs!", "snippet": "I.
