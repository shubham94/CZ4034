Mellon, however, didn't want to play, and sued to stop the attempt. Still, the industry's consolidation fever is making citizens' advocates and some lawmakers nervous; they predict that the behemoth mergers will eventually mean higher checking-account and A.T.M. costs for many customers, especially those with low and moderate incomes. And they point to Federal Reserve studies indicating that when newly merged banks consolidate operations, the branch offices they close tend to be concentrated more heavily in poorer neighborhoods. . . . Airlines also got into the consolidation act, with American Airlines and US Airways announcing a marketing alliance. Delta and United were planning a similar deal, but suspended talks after pilots voiced concern over what the arrangement would mean for jobs. INSURANCE Managed Care's Higher Cost For the first time since 1992, many employers are facing double-digit increases in the cost of health insurance next year, the highest inflation rate since the majority of employees moved into managed care. In early negotiations with employers about next year's rates, many insurers are seeking increases for 1999 that are far above this year's, when most premiums rose in single digits after four years of stability. Critics of managed care say the magnitude of the increases undercuts a basic appeal of that system: savings from lower costs. VIAGRA Impotence and Writer's Cramp In only its second week on the market, Viagra, Pfizer's impotence drug, accounted for 79.2 percent of the new prescriptions written for the condition, causing the market shares of its competitors to plunge, according to I.M.S. America, a health care information company. With 36,263 new prescriptions for Viagra written in the week that ended on April 10, the introduction was one of the best ever for a drug. Some analysts estimated that prescriptions written last week might have totaled 40,000 a day. WINDOWS The Crash of 98 William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, was trying to put Windows 98 through its paces at the Spring Comdex computer show in Chicago last week when things sort of fell apart. First, he couldn't get his microphone to work. Then, gasp, Microsoft's latest operating system crashed. ''I guess we still have some bugs to work out,'' Mr. Gates observed. ''That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet.'' Undaunted, Microsoft later reported earnings that surpassed analysts' expectations. JAPAN We Export, Therefore We Are While Japan's slumping stock market and banking industry tell a story of a nation in crisis, many citizens paint a different picture. ''People complain about the bad economy,'' says Mitsuo Okura, who lives in a small town 200 miles southwest of Tokyo. ''But when I look around the house, I've got everything I want. I've got three cars, and most families around here have two or three as well. I've got a couple of televisions, and so do most people. I've got a washing machine, a refrigerator, and so do all my neighbors.'' All that despite the fact that his auto parts business is failling. In part, Mr. Okura can thank Japan's trade surplus for his good fortune; it jumped almost 57 percent in March from the period a year earlier. Another perspective: Japan had more than 17,000 business bankruptcy filings in 1997, but the United States had more than 54,000. JOBS Americans Hire Foreigners . . . As the information technology industry lobbies Congress to let more highly skilled foreign workers enter the country, new immigration figures indicate that the companies applying for the most visas are using them for the kind of jobs that critics say many Americans could easily be trained to perform. The designation H1-B is used for work visas intended for hard-to-fill jobs. But the company that imported the most foreign labor under the program last year was Mastech Systems of Pittsburgh; it received visas for 1,733 employees -- or about 80 percent of its domestic work force -- to bring in software programmers with only bachelor's degrees. ''This is not brain surgery,'' Representative Ron Klink, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said of the jobs being filled by foreign workers at companies like Mastech. ''These jobs do require some skill and intellect. But American workers can be trained to take these jobs.'' By the way, United States jobless claims rose in mid-April. MORE JOBS . . . Foreigners Hire Americans Foreign companies are creating jobs in the United States five times faster than American-owned companies, according to a study by a trade group. The Organization for International Investment, a Washington trade association for 60 foreign companies with American operations, found the largest concentration of such jobs in California, though Nevada was the leading state in job growth from these investments. The number of Americans working for subsidiaries of foreign corporations increased from 2.03 million in 1980 to 4.9 million in 1995, the latest year for which statistics are available, the trade association said. EARTH DAY Apathy Doesn't Pay Though President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore took note of Earth Day by doing some repair work on the Appalachian Trail on Wednesday, they seem to be in the minority these days. ''There's been a precipitous decline in the demand for environmental improvement,'' according to Grant Ferrier, publisher of The Environmental Business Journal in San Diego. ''Environment is not in the top five public priority issues. From 1970 to about 1990, usually, environmental issues would come in the top three.'' Companies that help businesses comply with environmental regulations have felt the effects of the trend: Of 3,305 environmental service companies operating across the nation in 1994, one-fourth were out of business two years later, according to a survey by Environmental Information Ltd. of Minneapolis, which compiles a directory of such firms. The reasons included increased competition, cuts in government programs, fewer new regulations and a relaxation in the enforcement of rules already on the books.", "headline": {"main": "DIARY"}, "abstract": "Chinese Government announces that economy grew at annual rate of 7.2 percent in first quarter; leaders there see 8 percent as minimum needed to create enough jobs to prevent serious social unrest and allow important corporate and banking changes to proceed; photo (S)", "print_page": "2", "word_count": 996, "_id": "4fd20bec8eb7c8105d77ac80", "snippet": "DEALS  Consolidation Continues, As Do Consumer Worries  The Bank of New York joined the merger trend with an unsolicited $23.7 billion takeover offer for the Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh.
