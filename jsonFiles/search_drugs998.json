According to Dr. Laurent Rivier, the head of the I.O.C.-accredited laboratory in Lausanne, Switzerland, the lab is prepared to test blood samples for the presence of perfluorocarbon metabolites, or PFC. The substance is, in effect, a synthetic blood, with enormous oxygen-carrying capacity. But use of PFC can also be extremely dangerous, particularly without medical supervision. Although there is no reliable research on PFC abuse in humans, possible symptoms involve a perilous thickening of the blood.", "headline": {"main": "A New Threat in Blood Doping"}, "abstract": "IOC is concerned at reports about dangerous new drug, perfluorocarbon metabolites (PFCs), which is believed to increase endurance of athletes; plans are under way for lab testing, even as researchers close in on method for detecting abuse of artificial hormone EPO (S)", "print_page": "12", "word_count": 1054, "_id": "4fd1ef408eb7c8105d743956", "snippet": "Just as researchers are closing in on a method to detect abuse of the artificial hormone EPO among athletes, a dangerous new drug, which is also believed to substantially increase endurance, has aroused the active concern of the International Olympic...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/18/sports/a-new-threat-in-blood-doping.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EPO (RECOMBINANT ERYTHROPOIETIN) (DRUG)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PERFLUOROCARBONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ATHLETICS AND SPORTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TESTS AND TESTING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUG ABUSE AND TRAFFIC"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Paul", "lastname": "GAINS"}], "original": "By PAUL GAINS"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1998-10-18T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Sports"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 35}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
