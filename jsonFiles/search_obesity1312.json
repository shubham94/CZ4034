Under a crackdown begun several years ago, soldiers who do not meet established weight standards can be denied promotions, transfers and admission to training programs.", "snippet": "An army may march on its stomach, but it won't get very far if overeating turns the stomach into a potbelly.

Although a significant percentage of overweight children are not unhappy and participate unimpeded in normal childhood activities, many others suffer the censure of their peers, their parents and even themselves. They are the last to be chosen on teams, if they are chosen at all, and many have trouble making friends and participating in typical youthful activities. Classmates readily refer to them as fatso, blob or tubby. The resulting loneliness and idle hours simply add to their problems. With nothing better to do, they sit home and watch television and, yes, eat. Parents may exacerbate the situation in one of two ways. Some encourage overweight children to eat more than they should by using fattening foods as bribes and rewards for desired behavior and by leaving such foods around the house as a constant source of temptation. Other parents undermine their children's already shaky self-image and self-control by nagging them about bad eating habits and by registering disgust over the youngsters' size. Feeling unloved and unwanted, many such children drown their unhappiness in even more food or use food as a means of controlling their parents: defying the parents to stop them from eating what they will, thereby perpetuating the vicious cycle.", "snippet": "THE special pain of being a fat child in a world that worships thinness is hard for many adults to appreciate.
