Created by Dr. Frank Lipman, the founder and director of the Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in Manhattan -- which promotes \"good medicine,\" like lifestyle changes through diet, nutrition, exercise and stress management -- this dessert complies with his challenging but not impossible 14-day-long \"Be Well\" food-and-shake cleanse ($200). The gluten-free treat substitutes unsweetened vanilla almond milk for cream and calls for organic pumpkin and a little raw honey or cinnamon in place of sugar. \"When you eat sugars, your body gets an initial surge of energy, your body scrambles to process it, and then you crash,\" Lipman says about sugar, a depression-linked carbohydrate. \"This process triggers the body to crave more sugar, and a vicious cycle of craving, eating and crashing begins.\" Sounds alarmingly familiar, eh? On the bright side, Lipman does promote a lot of sleep to combat sugar cravings around the holidays. The easy-to-follow recipe is below, so you can nap and have all the taste of pumpkin pie you want this holiday season.Pumpkin Pie Smoothie - Serves 1", "headline": {"main": "Get Stuffed | A Cup o' Pumpkin Pie", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "abstract": "Before you devour your second (third?) slice of Mom's leftover homemade pumpkin pie, opt for a still seasonal but healthy alternative: an organic, sugar-free pumpkin pie smoothie.", "print_page": null, "word_count": 261, "_id": "4fd3a1718eb7c8105d8e82db", "snippet": "Before you devour your second (third?) slice of Mom's leftover homemade pumpkin pie, opt for a still seasonal but healthy alternative: an organic, sugar-free pumpkin pie smoothie.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/get-stuffed-a-cup-o-pumpkin-pie/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Kathryn", "lastname": "BRANCH"}], "original": "By KATHRYN BRANCH"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2011-11-25T11:30:24Z", "section_name": "T:Style"}], "meta": {"hits": 26, "offset": 0, "time": 77}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
