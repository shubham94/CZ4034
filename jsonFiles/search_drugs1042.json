No one talked about work rules in the 1930's, when ''welfare was made for middle-class white women,'' she says. ''They're really just targeting the black women.'' A bright, animated, street-smart woman who punctuates her speech with knowing glances -- you know what I'm talking about, her look insists -- Caples is telling her story on the No. 12 bus one July afternoon as it shakes and wheezes down Teutonia Avenue, past the check-cashing counters, liquor stores and lounges. She has dropped her three young daughters with her cousin, Jewel (actually with Jewel's 13-year-old nephew, Little Chuck, since Jewel wasn't around), and before long she'll be toting trash and swabbing toilets in the gastrointestinal lab of a downtown hospital. It's second-shift work and she's unhappy that her girls are asleep by the time the No. 12 shakes home.
