Tarps covered windows to keep out the sun. Dozens of gangly kids in ill-fitting formal wear swayed to a loop of dance rock in a gym tricked out with blue and yellow balloons. During breaks, 15-year-olds grabbed lunch in the set's shrunken cafeteria. Steps away from a hall lined with scratched-up lockers, a hidden staircase led to the cast's tutoring room, where a few school-age actors logged face time. Some were solving equations, others goofed off, charting city routes on a laptop flight simulator. A boy half sang, half translated the opening number from ''Cabaret.'' Outside the tutoring room, Melissa McIntyre, an 18-year-old actress with shimmering rock-chick makeup and dark choppy hair, was destroying her laconic co-star, Shane Kippel, at foosball. After scoring the final goal, McIntyre hooted and just about vaulted onto the game table, a blur of bare arms and boots. For those who know her only from ''Degrassi: The Next Generation,'' Epitome's international cult-hit TV show for teenagers, the victory dance was hard to believe -- like catching James Gandolfini arranging daisies in a glass vase. Ashley, the avenging, depressive good girl McIntyre has played for four years, never celebrates, even on those rare occasions when she wins something. From her first appearance as a sibilant 14-year-old priss, Ashley has followed the quintessential parents'-nightmare story arc: class president to class pariah to lovelorn loner, messing with drugs, disloyal friends and wretched poetry along the way.", "headline": {"main": "OMG I Love Ellie and Ashley.
