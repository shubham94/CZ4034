They have discovered instead that exercise is one of the best ways to become and remain attractive long after sedentary women have lost their trim, tight bodies and the flush of youth. Some also realize that regular vigorous exercise can help protect them against the ravages of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, varicose veins and osteoporosis as well as obesity. Still, women seem especially vulnerable to propaganda against exercise and to misinformation about who should exercise, how much, when and how. Many of these myths are explored and dispelled in a recent book that might have been called ''Exercise: Not For Women Only.'' (The book itself is not for women only, and should be read by all physicians who treat women.) Its actual title is ''The Complete Sports Medicine Book for Women'' (Simon and Schuster/Fireside, $16.95 in hard cover, $8.95 in paperback) and it was written by Dr. Mona Shangold, director of sports gynecology at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington and Dr. Gabe Mirkin of Silver Spring, Md., medical editor of Runner's World magazine and co-author with Marshall Hoffman of ''The Sportsmedicine Book'' (Little, Brown, 1978).", "snippet": "MILLIONS of American women seem to have overcome the notion that sweat-inducing exercise is unfeminine and unattractive.
