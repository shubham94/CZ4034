The growing dominance of managed care has helped control health care cost increases. Over time, managed care may also improve medical outcomes by emphasizing preventive care, coordinating the delivery of services and reducing the number of unnecessary procedures and tests. But as managed care becomes the primary structure for the delivery of health services in this country, the trend raises consumer concerns about access, quality and choice. Managed care reduces choice in doctors and places more control in the hands of plan administrators. In well-run plans, enrollees benefit from lower costs and more efficient services.
