He is a veterinary surgeon. Once in a while he tells me about some colleague of his who has got into the hands of the doctors. They always say to him, ''I should have gone to a vet.'' Vets do what doctors used to -- diagnose the injury or the condition, patch it up as best they can and remind you that these things happen and that in life we are also in the midst of death. I'm the sort of person who wants to know. For example, my partner and I went down to Orange County last year and had ourselves scanned at the famous facility that was profiled on ''Oprah.'' I signed up mostly out of curiosity. I expected to be congratulated for my fabulous good health. And it was interesting. I saw the shape of my own innards, and guess what, my heart and my liver actually were elongated -- I suppose to fit into my elongated torso. And there were calcifications that the radiologist thought indicated a silent victory of my immune system over a tubercular infection that I never knew I had. I was otherwise clean as a whistle (an effect I attribute to that universal solvent, Diet Coke). Oh, but my bones. Ghostly.
