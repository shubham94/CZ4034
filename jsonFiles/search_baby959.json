Beyond the banks lies a vast expanse of black spruce and tamarack, great coniferous forests broken here and there by lakes and bogs and kettle ponds. In winter, the taiga can be harsh and remorseless, a region racked by \"wind, snow and natural violence of every sort,\" as an adventurer described it a half-century ago. But it is also a landscape that teems with life in fall and spring, when enormous herds of caribous stomp across the earth and millions of migratory birds tarry in the estuaries of James and Hudson Bays, some stopping to double their weight as they feast on eelgrass and coastal shrimp before flying as far south as Tierra del Fuego. It is quiet in summer: on an August evening there is utter silence in the northern Quebec bush, save for the rippling of the river or the honking of a pair of geese overhead in a salmon-colored sky. This subarctic wilderness is, in any season, an unlikely subject of an international controversy. But that is precisely what it has become hundreds of miles away, in southern Quebec and in New York State's capital, Albany, where the central question about the Great Whale River basin is this: Should large parts of it be underwater? Hydro-Quebec, a utility owned by the province of Quebec, envisions flooding the Great Whale as the second of three phases in a planned hydroelectric power system of colossal proportions. To harness the kinetic energy in 20 wild rivers, Hydro-Quebec plans to erect three dozen huge dams and hundreds of dikes across the taiga, ultimately redrawing terrain in an area the size of France.", "headline": {"main": "Power Struggle"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "16", "word_count": 4490, "_id": "4fd1b2b28eb7c8105d6d61a9", "snippet": "AS THE GREAT WHALE River rises east out of Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada, its broad sandy shores quickly give way to a carpet of light-green lichen studded with granite outcroppings.
