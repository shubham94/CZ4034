While past studies have focused almost exclusively on the mother's contribution to fetal malformations and other pregnancy abnormalities, it is now becoming increasingly clear that the father may also play an important role in pregnancy mishaps.

Medical research indicates that Mr. Lefor's apprehensions are not unfounded. According to the most recent report on the subject, a 14-year study conducted in Japan, wives who did not smoke but were exposed to their husbands' cigarette smoke developed lung cancer at a significantly higher rate than did the nonsmoking wives of nonsmoking husbands. Furthermore, the risk to those women was calculated to be a half to a third as great as if they themselves smoked.", "snippet": "WHENEVER Helen Lefor took out a cigarette in recent months, her husband, Arnold, would say: ''Do you realize what you're doing to me?
