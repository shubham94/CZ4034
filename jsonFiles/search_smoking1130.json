Sold under the trade name Nicorette, the gum is the first antismoking substance to have gone through the extensive clinical and safety tests required for such F.D.A. approval. Dr. John W. Farquhar, director of Stanford University's heart-disease prevention program, likens Nicorette to methadone, which used to limit the pangs of withdrawal from heroin. In an interview in Patient Care magazine, he said that ''both substitutes prevent withdrawal symptoms without producing the 'pleasures' of the addicting drugs.''", "snippet": "NICOTINE is the most widely used addicting drug among Americans except for caffeine.
