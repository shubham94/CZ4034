Enter naproxen. For 10 years the leading prescription drug in its class (sold as Anaprox and Naprosyn), it is now being offered directly to consumers as Aleve, competitively priced at nearly one-tenth the cost of the equivalent prescription dose and available without the added pain of a doctor's bill. The $100 million advertising campaign begun by Aleve's manufacturer, Procter-Syntex Health Products Company in Cincinnati, insures that many of the 135 million Americans who develop an ache or pain sometime in the next three months will know about it and perhaps decide to give it a try. But before people switch from the product they rely on for pain relief, they should know more about the relative benefits and risks of the various choices, as well as their price tags. Painkillers Galore Aleve joins a crowded and confusing field. Over-the-counter pain relief comes in many guises: extra-strength, maximum strength, buffered and enteric-coated; in a wide range of dosages, and with brand names like Bayer Aspirin, Anacin, Excedrin, Ecotrin, Tylenol, Advil, Motrin IB and Nuprin.
