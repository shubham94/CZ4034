Many of the children Geiger treated were seriously malnourished, so he began writing \u201cprescriptions\u201d for food \u2014 stipulating quantities of milk, vegetables, meat, and fruit that could be \u201cfilled\u201d at grocery stores, which were instructed to send the bills to the health center, where they were paid out of the pharmacy budget. When word of this reached the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, which financed the center, an official was dispatched to Mississippi to reprimand Geiger and make sure he understood that the center\u2019s money could be used only for medical purposes. Geiger replied: \u201cThe last time I looked in my textbooks, the specific therapy for malnutrition was food.\u201d The official had nothing to say and returned to Washington.In some ways, the United States has come a long way since Lyndon Johnson declared the \u201cwar on poverty.\u201d But in others, we\u2019re still at square one. We now have a variety of federally-supported nutrition programs, but the health care system remains senselessly disconnected from the \u201csocial determinants of health.\u201d In this regard, the United States has fallen behind the rest of the world. If a politician in India announced a public health plan that neglected malnutrition, he would be ridiculed. Here, leaders make this kind of omission all the time. Almost all of the debate about the 2010 Affordable Care Act was consumed with questions about health care access and quality. But if we really want to improve the health of millions of people, we have to address the conditions that make them sick.", "headline": {"main": "Treating the Cause, Not the Illness", "kicker": "Opinionator"}, "abstract": "A group is training young volunteers to treat the social factors, like poor nutrition and housing, that make patients sick.", "print_page": null, "word_count": "1573", "_id": "4fd3a0548eb7c8105d8e584a", "snippet": "A group is training young volunteers to treat the social factors, like poor nutrition and housing, that make patients sick.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/treating-the-cause-not-the-illness/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}, {"value": "Doctors", "name": "subject", "rank": "2"}, {"value": "Medicine and Health", "name": "subject", "rank": "3"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "David", "lastname": "BORNSTEIN"}], "original": "By DAVID BORNSTEIN"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2011-07-28T21:40:03Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": "A collection of links by the reporters and editors of the Dining section.", "headline": {"main": "What We\u2019re Reading", "kicker": "Diner's Journal"}, "abstract": "A collection of links by the reporters and editors of the Dining section.", "print_page": null, "word_count": "300", "_id": "4fd3a0668eb7c8105d8e5a00", "snippet": "A collection of links by the reporters and editors of the Dining section.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/what-were-reading-234/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "Dining & Wine", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}], "byline": {"person": [], "original": "By THE NEW YORK TIMES", "organization": "The New York Times"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2011-07-28T10:29:06Z", "section_name": "Style"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": "How should the government improve the food label?", "headline": {"main": "Designing a Better Food Label", "kicker": "Well"}, "abstract": "A project at the University of California-Berkeley School of Journalism has taken on the task of designing a better food label, asking for ideas to replace the current black and white Nutrition Facts label that appears on every food package.", "print_page": null, "word_count": "875", "_id": "4fd3a0658eb7c8105d8e58de", "snippet": "A project at the University of California-Berkeley School of Journalism has taken on the task of designing a better food label, asking for ideas to replace the current black and white Nutrition Facts label that appears on every food package.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/designing-a-better-food-label/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}, {"value": "Design", "name": "subject", "rank": "2"}, {"value": "Diet and Nutrition", "name": "subject", "rank": "3"}, {"value": "Labeling and Labels", "name": "subject", "rank": "4"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Tara", "lastname": "PARKER-POPE"}], "original": "By TARA PARKER-POPE"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2011-07-28T09:44:16Z", "section_name": null}, {"type_of_material": "Recipe", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Science", "lead_paragraph": "These stuffed tomatoes can be made more flavorful with additional anchovies.", "headline": {"seo": "Sicilian Stuffed Tomatoes -
