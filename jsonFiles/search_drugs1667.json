Ottinger clashed last week over such issues as raising income taxes and financing their own campaigns. But they also agreed in a 90-minute debate at The New York Times that the major issues in the county were housing and education. One of the four - Oren J. Teicher, Peter A. Peyser, J. Edward Meyer or Bennie O. Batts - will be chosen Sept. 11 to run against the Republican Party's candidate, Joseph J. DioGuardi. Mr. Teicher, 35 years old, who is Mr. Ottinger's political heir and the choice of Democratic Party leaders, claimed to be alone among the candidates in saying that ''if we're going to be serious about reducing $200 billion deficits in 1985, we're going to have to raise taxes.''", "headline": {"main": "DEMOCRATS IN RACE FOR OTTINGER'S SEAT OUTLINE POSITIONS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 5889, "_id": "4fd1544b8eb7c8105d637a8a", "snippet": "T HE four Democrats waging a primary battle for the seat being vacated by Representative Richard L.

Even the American Medical Association and the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council, which have generally taken a conservative line on nutrition counseling, have recommended that sodium intake be restricted to 1,100 to 3,300 milligrams a day (the equivalent of half a teaspoon to one and a half teaspoons of salt), less than half of what Americans consume on average. Millions apparently listened and the food-processing industry got the message. Supermarkets as well as health-food stores now stock many items with reduced salt or no added salt. Dozens of cookbooks and buying guides have been published for the low-salt consumer. Salt-free seasoning mixes have claimed a place among the monosodium glutamates and seasoned salts.
