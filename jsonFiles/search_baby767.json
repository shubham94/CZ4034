So it is these days with Bill Bradley the politician. In his methodical way, Mr. Bradley, 55, has begun building the architecture for a presidential campaign in 2000, piece by tiny piece. Though he says he has not decided whether to run, he is talking more seriously with close advisers about a campaign, and taking more concrete steps to prepare for it, than at any other time since 1988, when he was first mentioned as a possible presidential contender.", "headline": {"main": "Bradley Carefully Weighs Presidential Run"}, "abstract": "Former Sen Bill Bradley shakes hands and talks with New Jerseyans basking on beaches, as he considers Presidential bid in his own methodical way; photo (S)", "print_page": "6", "word_count": 1173, "_id": "4fd1ff758eb7c8105d761b3e", "snippet": "In his Hall of Fame career with the New York Knicks, Bill Bradley lacked the insouciant grace of a natural athlete.
