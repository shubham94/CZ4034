That removed a big barrier to House passage of the tax bill later this week. The dissidents had held the bill hostage for two weeks, obliquely threatening to block a final vote on it unless they were guaranteed that Congress would not rush tax cuts into law and then renege on its promise to cut spending as well. The accord yesterday gave leaders assurance that their five-year, $189 billion package of tax cuts would pass an increasingly skeptical House. HEALTH INSURANCE DEDUCTION -- The Senate agreed to extend a tax deduction for health insurance for self-employed workers. The measure, contained in a House-Senate conference report, cleared the Senate by a unanimous voice vote and now goes to President Clinton, who is expected to sign it. The measure would allow an estimated 3.2 million self-employed people to deduct for tax purposes 25 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums. MEDICARE -- The Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills for the elderly will run out of money in 2002, the Clinton Administration told Congress. The annual report said that Medicare's hospital insurance program was now \"severely out of financial balance\" and that there was an urgent need for Congress to address the problem. But it recommended no specific measures. POLICY ON HOMOSEXUALS -- Gay-rights advocates, senior military officers and even some Republicans expressed surprise at Speaker Newt Gingrich's assertion that Congress would try to undo a two-year-old compromise policy on homosexuals in the military. \"This certainly isn't a part of the Contract With America,\" said Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican on the Armed Services Committee. \"We firmly believe there is not a problem with the existing law.\"", "headline": {"main": "Yesterday in Washington", "kicker": "DIARY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "23", "word_count": 303, "_id": "4fd1ef098eb7c8105d742b12", "snippet": "TAXES -- Speaker Newt Gingrich agreed to demands by dissident Republicans to tie tax-relief legislation loosely to future reductions in the Federal deficit.
