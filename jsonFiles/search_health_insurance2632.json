The genius of tort reform, which focuses on putting a cap on the awards from malpractice suits, is that it offends only one big-money lobbying group: trial lawyers, who are important financial supporters of the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, it helps or holds harmless Republican special interests in the insurance, drug and health care industries. The only problem is that it hurts the hapless patients who suffer grievous harm at the hands of incompetent doctors. We hold no brief for the current medical liability system, which does a poor job of compensating most victims of medical malpractice. An authoritative study of thousands of patients in New York State found that the vast majority who were harmed by medical errors or negligence never filed suit, whereas the vast majority of those who did file suit were not actually harmed by negligent doctors. Some studies suggest that, once a suit is filed, the courts do a reasonably good job of sorting out who deserves compensation, while other research has found that juries are swayed more by the severity of a plaintiff's injuries than by evidence of negligence. But in a medical system that is coming under increased fire for failing to deliver consistent quality in hospital care, it is clear that only a small number of people are being compensated for malpractice.", "headline": {"main": "Malpractice Mythology", "kicker": "Editorial"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": 714, "_id": "4fd283978eb7c8105d851701", "snippet": "\"Tort reform,\" the Bush administration's answer to the problem of high medical malpractice costs, makes sense from only one aspect: the political.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/09/opinion/9sun1.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BUSH, GEORGE W"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CONGRESS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INSURANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MALPRACTICE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SUITS AND LITIGATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CONSUMER PROTECTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-01-09T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Correction", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Because of an editing error, an article on Dec. 19 about nonprofit hospitals that charge fees to poor patients and sue for unpaid bills referred incorrectly to a settlement reached between North Mississippi Health Services, a six-hospital system, and a group of litigators that has filed class-action suits against hospitals.

Some pharmacies require prescriptions for the most potent drugs, others only an earnest chat with a druggist.
