T HOME, TOM STOPPARD - born Thomas Straussler, July 3, 1937, in Zlin, Czechoslovakia - is an English country squire, with an English garden, a lawn for cricket, a tennis court and a neighbor's cows peeping through rear windows. The Englishness, the squirehood, of Stoppard is one of the paradoxes in the life of this singular playwright. He is one of the wittiest and most literate writers of the English language, yet he quit school at 17 and found his education while working on a provincial English newspaper. He has no background in philosophy, philology, metaphysics or circus acrobatics, yet his plays are filled with knowledgeable references to these and other specialized fields. He is untutored in the ways of theater - except for his years as a drama critic - but his plays have a brilliant theatricality. In the plays themselves, nothing is ever quite what it seems: There are plays within plays and occasionally plays outside plays. On the cover of the English edition of his new play, ''The Real Thing,'' which opens in New York on Thursday at the Plymouth Theater, there is a drawing of a man on stage presenting a play about a man on a stage. The image is repeated and recedes to infinity, as in an endless series of Chinese boxes or an exercise in recursion, a characteristic of many of his plays.", "snippet": "Mel Gussow is a drama critic for The New York Times.
