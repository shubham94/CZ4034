But by virtually all measures, the region, the bowl-shaped home to 17 million air-breathing humans, remains the nation's capital of bad air. Cool, cloudy weather through the spring and summer and unusually early rains this fall combined to sharply reduce the number of days when levels of ozone, or smog, exceeded federal standards. This year, the region failed to meet the federal one-hour ozone standard on 27 days, compared with 68 last year.
