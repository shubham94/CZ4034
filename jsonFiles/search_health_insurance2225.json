Silicon Valley is filled with start-ups whose main business proposition is to be bought by Google, or for that matter by Yahoo or Microsoft. Countless other start-ups rely on Google as their primary driver of traffic or on Google's powerful advertising system as their primary source of income.

[C5.] STRUGGLES FOR SATELLITE RADIO -- Last year's debut of Howard Stern's radio show on Sirius Satellite Radio put the technology on the map. But stock of Sirius and its larger rival, XM Satellite Radio, have taken a battering from Wall Street, with share prices for both off about 50 percent from their year-ago levels. Now, the two companies may be considering an attempt to merge. [C1.] WHO RUNS THE MOUSE'S WEB SITE? -- Robert A. Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, is expected to unveil next week the new Disney.com Web site, which has taken more than a year to redesign. Revamping Disney.com has been a top priority as Mr. Iger seeks to extend the Disney brand by embracing new digital media. But he may be facing an equally pressing issue: Who within Disney should be running the company's Internet properties?

[C4.] DEADLY YEAR FOR NEWS MEDIA -- The year 2006 was the deadliest for journalists and media workers worldwide, with at least 155 killings and unexplained deaths, the International Federation of Journalists announced.
