Starting with Thanksgiving week, holiday preparations and parties, gift shopping and packaging, family visits and extra hours of work to make up for days off prompt millions of Americans to cheat on their sleep even more than usual. Many are used to being tired and think, optimistically, that they'll catch up with lost sleep after the New Year. But few do. And new research suggests that the consequences of chronic sleep deprivation may be far worse than simply diminished mental sharpness, shortened tempers and a tendency to doze off at every quiet moment. Rather, sleep scientists at the University of Chicago found that those who suffer from an accumulated sleep debt may develop serious health problems, including obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.", "snippet": "There is probably no time of year when America's sleep debt is greater than it is right now.
