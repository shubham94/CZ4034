Most doctors are not mendacious orna\u00efve. They sincerely want to help patients, and won't continue to recommend medicines that either don't workor incur significant side effects. Most research studies, no matter how accurateor manipulated, may convince a doctor to try a medicine, but they won't replaceclinical experience over time. And anyspeakers on behalf of a drug lose allcredibility if they proselytize unrealistically.I fear that the relationship between doctor and patient is threatened if open discussion of the uses of medications,even for so-called off-label administration, is curtailed. And I fear that themoney extracted from pharmaceutical companies will impact the resources dedicated to the development of moremedicines. JEROLD J. KREISMAN, M.D.St. Louis, Oct. 3 To the Editor: Much of the pharmaceutical mess began with the public advertising of prescription drugs, which encouraged the industry to change from a business model emphasizing efficacy to one emphasizing marketability. Marketing is a cakewalk compared with pharmacology, and it comes with a Pandora's box ofpotential abuses.Moreover, saturation advertising distorts the patient-physician relationshipby manipulating patient decision-making and mocking professional diagnostic expertise.Real health care reform, as opposed to health insurance reform, must in-clude reinstating a prohibition on the public marketing of prescription drugs.Let truly effective drugs sell themselves.
