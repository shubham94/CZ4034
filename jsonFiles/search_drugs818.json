Now aging baby boomers, never quiet about anything, can spend as many years without functioning ovaries as with them. Menopause, circa 2001, is no longer a life passage. It is a medical event. Of all the symptoms of menopause, the hot flash is the most intriguing. A classic hot flash begins with an aura, a vague sensation in the face and neck that blossoms over a period of a minute or two, skin temperature rising, pulse quickening, into a full-blown wave of heat and blushing and drenching sweat, often followed by chills. Japanese women, mysteriously, report fewer hot flashes than Americans. Spicy foods and hot drinks trigger hot flashes in some women but not others. Some women flash only sporadically. Some flash like clockwork, night and day, some only during sleep.", "headline": {"main": "LOCATION: NEW YORK; The Estrogen Alternative", "kicker": "10.

These were grim times for her. When she was 6, a disabled friend of her alcoholic grandmother began abusing her sexually. In seventh grade she began to withdraw. ''I felt there was no reason to go on,'' she says. ''I did my schoolwork and everything, but I was not happy in any way. I would just stay to myself. Everyone thought I couldn't talk for a while, because for a few years there I wouldn't say anything to anyone.'' Her first boyfriend, from her neighborhood in the slums around Washington, was physically and verbally brutal. After the birth of her first child, when she was 17, she managed to ''escape from him, I don't know how.'' Not long after, Wendy, a petite African-American woman with grave eyes and a wide mouth, was raped by a family friend. Soon after that, under pressure from her family, she married a man who was also abusive. She had three more children by him in the next two years. ''He was abusing the children too, even though he was the one who wanted them, cursing and yelling all the time, and the spankings, I couldn't take that, over any little thing, and I couldn't protect them from it.'' She also had to assume responsibility at this time for her sister's children, because the sister was addicted to crack cocaine. Wendy began to experience major depression -- not simply the generalized despair that might be expected of someone in her position, but an organic illness that was utterly disabling: ''I'd had a job, but I had to quit because I just couldn't do it. I didn't want to get out of bed, and I felt like there was no reason to do anything. I'm already small, and I was losing more and more weight. I wouldn't get up to eat or anything. I just didn't care. Sometimes I would sit and just cry, cry, cry. Over nothing. I had nothing to say to my own children. After they left the house, I would get in bed with the door locked. I feared when they came home, 3 o'clock, and it just came so fast. I was just so tired.'' Wendy began to take pills, mostly painkillers. ''It could be Tylenol or anything for pain, a lot of it, though, or anything I could get to put me to sleep.''", "headline": {"main": "LOCATION: WASHINGTON, D.C.; A Cure For Poverty", "kicker": "11.

To date, only one disease, smallpox, has been completely removed from nature. There are many others, however, for which the necessary treatments are widely available and for which a plan of attack has already been drawn. With the right financing, the following illnesses could soon be consigned to history. 1. POLIO What it is: A virus that attacks the central nervous system Where it's found: Africa and Asia When it could be conquered: 2005 Projected cost: $1 billion Status report: In 1988, the World Health Organization began a coordinated campaign to administer the Sabin vaccine. Since then, the number of cases has fallen by more than 95 percent. (In India, 134 million children were vaccinated in a single day.) But in many areas, total vaccination has not occurred, and as long as the virus survives anywhere -- in Chechnya, say, or Sierra Leone -- it can spread anywhere else on the globe. Human beings are the only creatures affected by polio, however, so scientists believe that once the virus is eliminated from every community, the disease will disappear, and vaccination will no longer be necessary. The vaccine costs 20 cents; administering it can cost up to $3.", "headline": {"main": "The Way We Live Now: 5-6-01: Salient Facts: Global Health Campaigns; Ten Diseases on the Way Out"}, "abstract": "Robert Mackey article on ten diseases that could be eradicated by global health campaigns in next few years; cites status and cost of eradication efforts; photos (M)", "print_page": "34", "word_count": 1371, "_id": "4fd22ff98eb7c8105d7be5a3", "snippet": "With all the high-tech medical research currently under way, new cures for disease seem to roll out of the laboratory at an ever-faster pace.
