It's hard to tell that from the makeup of the panel. The board of outside scientists is supposed to assure the accuracy and fairness of two yet-unpublished studies conducted by the agency on the health effects of secondhand cigarette smoke. And yet six members, including the chairman, Dr. Morton Lippmann of New York University, have ties, some stronger than others, to a research group financed by Philip Morris Companies , the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Lorillard Inc. , three of the largest tobacco companies. A seventh member was appointed at the urging of Philip Morris. The tobacco industry's influence was also reflected in the treatment of another member, Dr. David Burns of the University of California. Dr. Burns wrote the Surgeon General's report on passive smoking and is widely considered a leading expert on the issue. He was dismissed from the research panel in response to complaints from the tobacco industry, and reinstated only after the dismissal was publicly disclosed. If the Environmental Protection Agency is really concerned about the credibility of its findings on smoking, there's a clear path: Reconstitute the panel now.", "snippet": "\"We were concerned about the appearance of conflict of interest,\" a spokesman for the Federal Environmental Protection Agency said about the agency's recently appointed 16-member scientific panel on smoking.
