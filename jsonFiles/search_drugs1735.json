McNeil had known about this two days before, but he had kept the information from his wife, Liz. It was more than embarrassment. For Howard McNeil, it had the potential of personal tragedy. McNeil, who is 22 years old, with clean features, an easy smile and a well-spoken manner, was the co-captain of the Seton Hall Pirates. He played point guard - an unusual position for a player who stands 6 feet 9 inches tall. He was the second-tallest player on the team, but he is a deft ball handler - the basketball term is, ''He's got eyes.'' He was also versatile, and he had started for Seton Hall at center as a freshman and at forward as a sophomore. For not meeting the 2.0 minimum grade-point average, McNeil's already-slim chances of playing for a lot of money in the National Basketball Association - a dream he has held since boyhood - could be in jeopardy. McNeil's is a dream shared by thousands of others; a dream that is realized by precious few.", "headline": {"main": "BASKETBALL DREAM THAT MAY NOT COME TRUE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 3191, "_id": "4fd121288eb7c8105d5e2991", "snippet": "THREE weeks ago, on Friday, Jan. 22, Seton Hall University announced with regret that Howard McNeil, a senior, and two other basketball players, Daryl Devero and Clark Young, were being declared academically ineligible and would be forced to sit out...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/14/sports/basketball-dream-that-may-not-come-true.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "FINES (PENALTIES)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COLLEGE ATHLETICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASKETBALL"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Ira", "lastname": "BERKOW"}], "original": "By IRA BERKOW"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1982-02-14T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Financial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "The Brunswick Corporation, in a strategic move to frustrate a $600 million takeover bid by the Whittaker Corporation, disclosed yesterday that it had tentatively agreed to sell its Sherwood Medical Group to the American Home Products Corporation for $425 million. The announcement came after United States District Court Judge Joel M. Flaum in Chicago rejected Whittaker's motion to prevent the sale of Sherwood - one of Whittaker's chief objectives in attempting to acquire Brunswick. K. Brooks Abernathy, chairman of Brunswick, which makes leisure, medical and technical products, had testified Wednesday in a suit against Whittaker that Brunswick had turned down another bid for Sherwood, for $450 million. Explaining why, Ross Stemer, spokesman for Brunswick, said the $450 million offer provided for payment in cash and, therefore, would have been taxable to Brunswick. He said the American Home offer provided for payment in Brunswick stock and, consequently, would not be taxable. Mr. Stemer added that the offer was thus ''worth about $490 million.''", "headline": {"main": "BRUNSWICK OUTFLANKS A BIDDER"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 778, "_id": "4fd121308eb7c8105d5e2d1d", "snippet": "The Brunswick Corporation, in a strategic move to frustrate a $600 million takeover bid by the Whittaker Corporation, disclosed yesterday that it had tentatively agreed to sell its Sherwood Medical Group to the American Home Products Corporation for...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/12/business/brunswick-outflanks-a-bidder.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECREATION AND LEISURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TENDER OFFERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STOCKS AND BONDS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Robert", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "COLE", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By ROBERT J.

In their relaxed, pragmatic outlook, they resembled Alfred E. Neuman, the Mad magazine character, whose slogan is ''What, me worry?'' The centenarians took life in their stride, didn't overreach their grasp, lived one day at a time, didn't get bogged down by disappointments and rarely worried, got excited or upset.
