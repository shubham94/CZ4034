Only 408 of the 2,000 Americans in Albania had been lifted out. Gunmen fired into the air during Italy's evacuation, hitting one helicopter but not seriously damaging it. 1 Refugees from the chaos in Albania have been reaching Italian shores, some flying the white flag of surrender. But the Italians, worried that they are about to face a recurrence of the Albanian exodus of 1991, have been keeping close track of them. 6 Israel to Start Housing Project The Israeli Cabinet resolved to go ahead with construction of a Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem despite warnings of potential Palestinian resistance. The Cabinet reaffirmed its decision as the nation mourned seven schoolgirls killed by a Jordanian soldier. The attacker remained in custody, and no new information emerged about his motives. 4 The attacker's family said he had psychological problems but no history of violence or ties to militant groups. King Hussein appointed a former intelligence chief to head the investigation, raising speculation about possible political motives for the attack. 4 No New NATO Forces in East NATO made a new concession to Russian concerns about its expansion. The alliance said it had no intention of stationing permanent foreign forces for ground combat in countries that did not already have them. NATO officials hoped the concession would serve as an olive branch in advance of next week's Russian-American summit talks in Helsinki. 6 Zaire Rebels Attack Kisangani Zairian rebels launched an attack on Zaire's third-largest city, Kisangani, creating panic among Government troops and civilians. Western diplomats said the assault began with a mortar barrage, followed by shooting inside the city and a convergence of rebel fighters. Kisangani, the unofficial capital of northeast Zaire, is the biggest strategic target so far in the rebels' campaign. 7 Mexican Defends Bank Deposit Mario Ruiz Massieu, who deposited $9 million in a Texas bank while he was a deputy attorney general in Mexico, told a Federal court that he shipped the money out of the country for fear that Mexico was sliding into chaos. Narcotics corruption in Mexico and the country's political crisis dominated testimony at a civil trial focusing on whether Mr. Ruiz Massieu can legally keep the money. 7 80 Feared Dead in Iran Crash A military cargo plane crashed in the mountains of northeastern Iran, killing the 80 or more people aboard, the Government news media said. The American-built C-130 crashed near Mashhad, a city holy to Shiite Muslims that is more than 400 miles northeast of Teheran.

Yeltsin of Russia as planned. Doctors said he would have to wear a leg brace and use crutches. 1 X Chromosome Is Mapped Researchers completed a high-resolution map of the X chromosome, one of the pair that determines whether a human is male or female.

Finds 7 in Atlanta The F.B.I. in Atlanta said it had located seven of the nine people whose images it had released less than 24 hours previously as part of the investigation into the bombing during the Olympics.

The drugs, called protease inhibitors, have been successful in reducing the levels of the AIDS virus in adults.

Herman, had helped a woman who had bought her consulting firm obtain a spot on a Commerce Department trade mission last year. The White House defended the help as proper and said it was not related to contributions to the Democratic Party by the woman and her sister. 10 Less Forceful Air Bags Allowed The Government told automobile manufacturers they could make air bags that open with less force than had previously been required. The manufacturers said they would make the change on all cars by the end of the 1998 model year. The change would reduce the danger to children and small adults, some of whom have been killed by the more powerful air bags. 11 Suspect Called Unremarkable The teen-age Ukrainian immigrant accused of killing Ennis Cosby seemed so quiet and polite to most people with whom he came in contact that, they said, he seemed to escape notice and memory. 11 NEW YORK/REGION 25-29 Crew Urges Justice Dept. To Let School Plan Proceed Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew urged the Justice Department not to keep a hard-won reorganization of New York City's schools from taking effect on April 1.
