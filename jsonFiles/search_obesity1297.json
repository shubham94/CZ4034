It is possible, however, that these findings are related to increased stress, which has been shown in both laboratory animals and humans to increase the incidence and rate of growth of breast cancer. It has now been clearly documented that emotional stress is associated with a decline in immune-system parameters responsible for defenses against cancer. Inability to express anger, frustration, loss of important emotional relationships and social isolation have been particularly incriminated, especially for breast malignancies.", "snippet": "To the Editor:   ''The death rate from breast cancer in young and middle-aged white women has swerved sharply upward after more than a decade of steady decline,'' the National Cancer Institute reports, adding, ''The reasons for this increase are not...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "ROSCH, PAUL J", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "STRESS, AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "LIFE STYLES", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "LABOR", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "BREAST", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "STRESS (HUMAN)", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "CANCER", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "WOMEN", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "18", "type_of_material": "Letter", "word_count": 332, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
