Judge Bruce S. Jenkins cited evidence that in St. George, Utah, fallout after a 1953 explosion code-named Harry caused a radiation monitor there to go ''off scale'' before any warning was given to the local populace. Four of those who died of cancer or leukemia were in or near St. George. His judgment leaned heavily on the arguments of Dr. John W. Gofman, emeritus professor of medical physics at the University of California in Berkeley. In 1970 Dr. Gofman and Dr. Arthur R. Tamplin, both at the Federal Government's Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, created a furor when they asserted that radiation from nuclear power plants destined thousands of Americans to premature deaths.", "snippet": "The landmark ruling Thursday by a Federal district judge that the Government had been negligent in the way it conducted nuclear tests in Nevada was based on the ''contributory role'' that radiation from the explosions played in causing 10 cancers,..."}, {"word_count": 1416, "slideshow_credits": null, "multimedia": [], "news_desk": "Science Desk", "pub_date": "1984-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/08/science/complex-coercion-binds-sex-rings-using-children.html", "blog": [], "_id": "4fd137058eb7c8105d6091ee", "headline": {"main": "COMPLEX COERCION BINDS SEX RINGS USING CHILDREN"}, "subsection_name": null, "abstract": null, "section_name": "Science; Health", "byline": {"original": "By DANIEL GOLEMAN", "person": [{"rank": 1, "firstname": "Daniel", "lastname": "GOLEMAN", "role": "reported", "organization": ""}]}, "print_page": "1", "document_type": "article", "type_of_material": "News", "keywords": [{"value": "PSYCHIATRIC ASSN, AMERICAN", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "CHILD ABUSE", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "SEX CRIMES", "name": "subject"}], "lead_paragraph": "IN a major child abuse study, social scientists have shed new light on the ways children are lured into sex rings, why they stay and the protective steps parents can take. The study, published in the official journal of the American Psychiatric Association, differs from others that have examined such adult-operated sex rings in that it focuses on the children's point of view and thus provides some answers to explain why children comply with the rules of a sex ring and remain silent about their participation. It shows that the adults who head the rings play on the normal interests of young children who are often in a period of their lives in which sexual experimentation is part of their psychological development. The adults lead them into joining what is in effect a secret society, frequently complete with ritual, to which they become tied by bonds of threats and fear on the one hand, and enticements such as drugs, alcohol and money on the other. Entrance into a sex ring, according to the research, involves the children in an elaborate indoctrination into the mores of the secret society. The children are taught to see the ring's activities as ''normal.'' The children rarely tell their parents or others of their participation, partly out of fear and partly because they learn to approve of a group that serves some of their needs for attention and belonging, the researchers said.", "snippet": "IN a major child abuse study, social scientists have shed new    light on the ways children are lured into sex rings, why they   stay and the protective steps parents can take.
