Bush's signature issue -- education, particularly education for young, poor children. In terms of giving this convention a softer and more inclusive feel, this was a wise choice. Yet it also illuminated the central paradox of a conclave marking Mr. Bush's emergence as the party's trend-setter. On the one hand, the vast convention hall was positively awash in soaring language and inspiring individual success stories designed to highlight Mr. Bush's signature promise that no child, no matter how disadvantaged, would be left behind. On the other hand, the same delegates who cheered this vision in prime time had earlier ratified a platform that defines a narrower, less generous world in which the federal government has virtually no role to play in shaping the country's educational future. This paradox revolves around a fundamental question about Mr. Bush's candidacy, a question he can go a long way toward answering in his acceptance speech Thursday night. Does his noble rhetoric about compassionate conservatism spring from a genuine determination to lead his party toward a more activist role in education, or is it just empty salesmanship? Based on the numbers, the rank-and-file seems willing to be led. In a New York Times survey of delegates to this convention, 26 percent ranked education the No. 1 issue in their states, whereas four years ago the economy was No. 1 for the same number and education received a measly 2 percent. Yet it was not clear whether they were prepared to spend more money on the problem than their leaders in Congress, who for the last eight years have often tried to cut education spending.", "headline": {"main": "Image and Reality on Education"}, "abstract": "Editorial says Gov George Bush's focus on education as signature issue at Republican National Convention in Philadelphia is wise choice in terms of giving convention softer and more inclusive feel, but also illuminates its central paradox; says same delegates who cheered Bush's vision of providing education especially for poor and disadvantaged, also ratified platform that defines narrower, less generous world in which federal government has virtually no role to play in shaping country's educational future (M)", "print_page": "20", "word_count": 663, "_id": "4fd240c98eb7c8105d7d8b4c", "snippet": "The first of four theme nights at the Republican Party's meticulously planned national convention focused on what has become George W.
