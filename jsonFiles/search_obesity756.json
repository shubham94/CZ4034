Benasillo, the president of Studio D, a company in New York that designs and manufactures logos and signs for retail stores, had just attended a talk by McKee, a partner at the Geppetto Group, a New York marketing firm. McKee had discussed the appeal of fictional characters like Harry Potter and, more broadly, how kid culture had saturated consumer society to the extent that it was becoming the central creative marketing force of our era. This is indeed what McKee usually talks about. He says things like ''The lifestyle of kids for the first time in history is something we study.'' Or ''Kid culture has become the most intriguing kind of culture around.'' In conversation, he tends to pile up the ideas before you, drawing on children's music or comics or (most often) the films of Pixar -- ''Toy Story,'' ''Finding Nemo,'' ''The Incredibles'' -- as examples of the intermingling of kid and adult cultures, a phenomenon that to him suggests children are becoming far more sophisticated about products and entertainment at the same time as adults (he calls them kidults) are increasingly reveling in youth-based content. ''Is it just that the kids want to be older,'' McKee asks, ''or is it that adults want to stay younger longer?'' When Benasillo heard McKee talk like this, he sought him out in Orlando and introduced himself. Then he told him what he had been working on. Benasillo had an idea he was trying out at a shopping mall on Staten Island. It began as a sudden inspiration -- KidKaf\u00e9, a restaurant that he imagined would give families a dinner option that was a step above McDonald's in terms of price and quality, but slightly below, say, Applebee's in price and formality. ''I was trying to create this Starbucks-for-kids type atmosphere,'' says Benasillo, who began the initial design work early in 2002. ''I wanted bright colors and curves; I wanted it to appear pretty futuristic, but not to the point that I wanted it to be a theme restaurant.'' Benasillo, with help from some of his colleagues at his design firm, dreamed up drinks, desserts and d\u00e9cor for his restaurant; he settled on the name Ozon (pronounced oh-zone) after it outscored KidKaf\u00e9 in focus groups. But his greatest eureka moment came at a restaurant trade show, when he found something that pulled everything together: a sandwich press with which Ozon could (1) start with a layer of parbaked bread; (2) add a sandwich filling of any type; (3) put down another layer of parbaked bread; (4) smash the whole thing together until it was hot and toasty and end up with a perfectly sealed warm discus with no visible trace of the filling inside. Here was precisely the kind of hip, futuristic branding that Benasillo was sure kids and parents would love.", "snippet": "Inside the Geppetto Group, an advertising firm that aims at kids \u0097 and their all-consuming mothers.", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "GEPPETTO GROUP", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "MARKETING AND MERCHANDISING", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "ADVERTISING AND MARKETING", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "100", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 4869, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}, {"news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "document_type": "article", "_id": "4fd25a028eb7c8105d80699d", "headline": {"main": "At Private Schools, Healthier Food Wins Favorable Reviews (Mostly)"}, "pub_date": "2004-11-26T00:00:00Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"original": "By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS", "person": [{"lastname": "HARTOCOLLIS", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Anemona", "organization": "", "role": "reported"}]}, "abstract": "Calhoun School and St Hilda's and St Hugh's, two private schools in Manhattan, have put their students on healthy food regimen; parents at both schools had complained that their children were not eating healthy food in school cafeterias; Chef Robert Surles says menu at Calhoun School is based on organic ingredients; photos (M)", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/26/education/26organic.html", "section_name": "Education; New York and Region", "lead_paragraph": "Soon after he was hired to cook healthy food in the cafeteria at the Calhoun School, a private school on the Upper West Side, Robert W.
