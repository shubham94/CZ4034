Unlike Pennsylvania and Ohio, however, New York is perceived as squarely in Mr. Gore's corner and is a reliable source of campaign cash. The vice president stopped first at the Park Avenue home of Alan J. Patricof, a financier, where 40 people paid $12,500 each for a total take of $500,000. At the next stop, the 90th Street home of Mitchell Blutt, a doctor and venture capitalist, 50 people paid $10,000 each, also yielding $500,000. At Mr. Patricof's apartment, Mr. Gore praised his listeners, many of whom had supported President Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and had been contributing to the Democratic Party ever since. The vice president thanked them for ''being a constant source of good common-sense advice on how to pursue progressive values in a way that would ensure economic strength, build the economy and lift up the people who most need the benefits of good policy.''
