His voice holds a pinch of his native Tennessee and the gritty effect of the filtered Winstons he smokes nonstop. He is candid, and a little coarse, his repartee sprinkled with curses and off-color jokes. But for years, few people in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have seemed to mind. The affection with which the neighborhood holds him was much in evidence on a sweltering Saturday in August. During his campaign for the City Council district that covers Brownsville, Ocean Hill and parts of East Flatbush and Bedford-Stuyvesant, Frank, 65, was making his way through a crowd taking in a concert at Betsy Head Memorial Playground. Encountering tough-looking teenage boys wearing do-rags and stud earrings, he slapped their backs so warmly, they couldn't help smiling. Two graying women munching on fried shrimp reached out for handshakes. A man in a yellow fishing hat struck a salute.", "headline": {"main": "The Kennedys Of Brownsville"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2699, "_id": "4fd2510d8eb7c8105d7f519c", "snippet": "The Boylands arrived dirt-poor from Memphis and have ruled over central Brooklyn politics for 30 years.
