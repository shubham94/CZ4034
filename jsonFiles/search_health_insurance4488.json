STATEMENT BY SENATOR ROCKEFELLER We're all here to confront problems, not to pretend that they don't exist. We're all here to represent the people of our states as part of the same union, bound together as a nation. And now we have reached this moment when we confront a problem called health care in America. In our wake are years and years of speeches about the crisis of rising health care costs and diminishing health care coverage. . . . We've reached out in terms of making alliances not mandatory but voluntary; we've stretched out the time line. If there is ever to be a mandate, it will never happen until the next century, and only then under certain circumstances, only if the Congress doesn't follow the orders of the commission. We have reached out. But . . . this does have to be a two-way process. We cannot constantly be reaching out and out and more and more, and then nothing comes back. So it's very hard to reach agreement that way. So here we are with our years of speeches about this crisis. This debate begins after, as you go over the years, I would say virtually thousands of hearings here in Congress, certainly tens of thousands of hearings. There've been public meetings at our homes and visits that all of us have had with people of our states, hundreds of reports, hundreds of studies and commissions, mountains. They fill cabinets in everyone's offices and in distant chambers somewhere in this complex, telling us some of the grim facts about health care in America. Emphasis on Realism We have to be realistic. The Senator from Minnesota spoke about the fact that we let the market work. That's one of the compromises that Senator Mitchell has made in his bill, is to give more time for the market to work. But I have to point out to my friends on the other side that the Department of Labor has recently indicated that workers who are insured, who have insurance through their jobs, that their number dropped from 66 percent to 61 percent over the last 10 years, and that the trend is downward under the voluntary system. That means, Mr. President, that 5.5 million more working insured Americans are now uninsured. The market system works in different sectors in different ways. Does it work perfectly in health care? I'm afraid not. At some point we have to draw on everything that we have learned from the experts, from our own constituents and from our own souls, and decide on the actual steps that will solve as much of the problem as we possibly can this year. With the health care plan submitted by the majority leader, we now have that opportunity. This is a bill that tries to achieve the major goals of health care reform in ways that will work and that we can afford and that are fair. The majority leader can only offer the rest of us the opportunity to act; he has no powers further than that. Then it's up to us. . . . If too many senators treat this debate upcoming as only a chance to score points one against the other, one party against the other, their win is the American people's loss. If too many senators also stay stuck on the idea that we should hold off one more time, until next month or next year or the next election, their delay dashes the hopes of millions of Americans, many in my state, that are now thinking maybe, just maybe, something will soon happen here to help them with their health care nightmares. STATEMENT BY SENATOR KERREY The question before us is whether or not we have the capacity to bridge the differences between Republicans and Democrats and pass a bill that is urgently needed by the people, urgently needed. . . . There truly are people in America watching now, hoping that this debate gets interesting, and hoping that the debate, as a consequence of getting interesting, leads to a finished product, the enactment of legislation. The question before us is, Can we bridge the differences? . . . It is true that we are dealing with a seventh of the U.S. economy. It is true that we are dealing with something that's life and death for the American people, and so we need to give it our full and serious consideration. We're prepared to do that. Demand for Care Many of us, indeed I would say most of us, have spent a great deal of time studying this issue, a great deal of time at home looking at the problems that are there. It is, as the President said, bankrupting this country. There will be a $38 billion increase from last year to this year just in Federal spending for health care -- $38 billion. . . . It is a tremendous amount of money, and the President of the U.S., when he started this thing, said it's bankrupting America, and it is bankrupting businesses and, increasingly, it's bankrupting families. Why? Well, in part we're demanding expensive health care. Not very many of us walk in and say, \"Could you give me the cheapest thing you've got.\" . . . We've gone from a point in 1950 where 80 percent of the bills were paid with cash; today, 80 percent is either socialized through the Government or it's socialized through insurance. Eighty percent have our health care bills paid for by someone else. And it's a consequence that most of us don't even know what the price is. And most of us in this body need to be reminded that, for tens of millions of Americans, even having a baby can be a financial catastrophe. Mr. President, it costs $12,000 to have a baby in this city. Imagine that, $12,000. That's two-day normal vaginal delivery. Now the insurance companies only pay for a day. Two-day normal delivery, $12,000. Mr. President, my babies were born 19 and 17 years ago, and I paid cash. I didn't have to be insured 20 years ago. Why? Because having a baby wasn't a financial catastrophe if you weren't insured. We have driven increased demand into the system. In order to provide coverage for individuals, in order to reach out and help individuals pay the bills, we've driven increased demand into the system. The price goes up, the requirement for increased subsidies occurs as a consequence. . . . There are tens of millions of Americans out there who do not have the capacity to pay the bills, who are forced to ingratiate themselves, to remain on welfare before they are told that they're eligible. All of us feel that there's a problem in America. We can see the gaps and differentials that separate Republicans and Democrats, and my sincere hope and prayer is that the momentum that seems to have stopped, that seems to have caused lots of us to say, \"Well, I'm not sure we're going to get a bill\" ---- I hope that we are able in a quiet moment to acquire the humility necessary to see that the American people are counting on us to set aside our differences and enact legislation this year. It is urgently needed. And we ought to do the best we can and get a bill to the President of the United States so that he can sign it on behalf of millions of Americans who are hoping and praying that we are able to get the job done. STATEMENT BY SENATOR DOMENICI I want to talk a little bit about health care reform and the Federal budget. Now, why would I do that? Because essentially, whether we like it or not, we are going to be voting on legislation that has a big effect on our children and grandchildren in terms of the budget of the United States, whether we are still in enormous deficit position, whether we are still unable to pay our bills as a nation. And thus, in a very real sense, the effect on the Federal budget of this plan -- and any major plan -- is of extreme importance, and we ought to try our best up front to understand. It not so easy because we are sending new things to those who make the estimates all the time. Evidence of that today when every section in this bill has been changed, and yet we had some estimated costs in here the day before yesterday. . . . So we must be careful not to saddle our young people and to burden future generations with today's health care costs. . . . There is no more compelling case for controlling health care costs than their current and projected impact on the Federal budget. Indeed, one of the most critical issues facing the country is continued growth of open-ended mandatory spending in the Federal budget. That is, you create a situation where a citizen is entitled as a matter of law to benefits and if you don't pay them, they can enforce it in a court of law. That's the definition of an entitlement. And this is led today by Medicare and Medicaid and the resulting growth in budget deficits. . . . New Entitlements These new entitlements will bring millions of Americans onto the Federal Government's subsidy program, and let me give you the best estimates I can there. An estimated 100 million Americans will be eligible for Senator Mitchell's premium subsidies alone, not counting the long-term care, which is a new program with new beneficiaries, and other entitlements in this bill. I am not counting them; I am only counting the recipients of subsidies in whole or in part from insurance premiums. And what's most alarming to me is the growth rate of these new entitlement programs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the new premium subsidy program will grow over 10 percent a year even after it is phased in. So if we thought we had things under control and we're getting them there with new health care reform admittedly, right up front the Congressional Budget Office warns us that these subsidy programs will grow at a rate of 10 percent a year even after they are phased in. The Medicare drug benefit, a brand new one, grows at 10.5 percent a year even after phased in. The long-term-care program grows 44 percent a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office once it's in full effect. So I don't think there can be any mistake about it: The Mitchell-Clinton bill, under the guise of health care reform, will create several new open-ended, runaway entitlement programs. STATEMENT BY SENATOR CHAFEE I want to say I'm delighted we're moving into this health reform legislation this week. It's very complicated, but I think it's time for us to do the best we can do struggle for constructive changes that are going to help our citizens lead healthier lives. . . . No American's going to remain untouched. It's going to affect how we're born, how we live, how we die. And this is far-reaching. I think I just saw in the paper a note of a little child born in Pawtucket, Diana Rebello, Pawtucket, R.I., born on Sunday night, Aug. 7, in Women and Infants Hospital in Providence. Think of her life and what it means. And then I think of Theresa Nigrelli of Westerly -- 100 years old, still stringing pearls every day at Nigrelli Jewelers. And she doesn't even need glasses. So we think of her, too. And the financial aspects of this are mind-boggling. They've been touched on before, but I'd like to repeat: one-seventh of our economy in the United States of America is devoted to health care, one-fifth of the Federal budget. Of the five biggest items in the Federal budget -- Social Security, defense, interest on the debt, Medicare and Medicaid -- it's the last two that are going right off the chart, Medicare and Medicaid. Defense, banging along, going down. Social Security, fairly stable. Interest on the debt going up but not such a substantial amount. But it's the last two that are causing us our principal problem. Now, the 1,410-page bill before us was only released a couple of days ago, and as I understand -- I'm not sure it's accurate -- I understand that changes are still being made to it. So it's up to us during this debate to air thoroughly for the American people what's in this proposed legislation and to insure that our actions don't make the situation any worse. Clearly we don't want to go backwards. . . . Now we all know from study and vast experience and listening to witnesses much that's right and much that's wrong with our health care system. And we acknowledge that in many respects it's exemplary: in technology and innovation, the skill of our professionals and the range of choices. But we also know there are several things that demand reform. And it seems to me very important to keep in mind, What are we trying to do? What's the endgame here? Goal of Security And I think our objectives are three: First, we must give Americans health security. We want to insure to hard-working people like Christopher North of North Smithfield, R.I., that he doesn't live in fear of losing his coverage. He, his wife and two sons were covered by his wife's policy through her employer. She lost her job. They applied for a new policy. They were turned down. Why? Because their son had a pre-existing condition. Minor though it might have been, it was enough for the insurance company to turn him down and thus their family's insurance down. . . . But what about job lock? In other words, staying in a job you want to leave but you can't because if you go to the new place you won't be able to get insurance. Donald Bolster, Bristol, R.I., 13 years with Blue Cross. His wife suffers now from Parkinson's. No other insurance people, plan, will take them on because of a pre-existing condition. They can't shop for insurance coverage. They can't get an alternative plan. They don't have portability. They can't move to another job. That's what's known as job lock. Covering the Uninsured The second objective: We must extend health insurance to those -- as many as we can -- who are not now covered. We want to make sure that the first group can keep their insurance; the second group we want to extend it to them. We know the statistics: 15 percent of Americans, 37 million Americans, at any one time without health insurance. In my state, it's 92,000 of our citizens -- 15,000 of them are, regrettably, children. Can't get, or don't have, health insurance. Now who are these uninsured? Many people have the impression that the uninsured are the poor or the elderly. That's no so. . . . The very poor have Medicaid; the elderly have Medicare. Ironically, in our system, single-parent families are better-off in terms of health insurance than two-parent families. Single parent families are frequently on Medicaid. But two-family parents aren't. One of them's working and works for a company that doesn't provide it; the other, the wife, is at home or she's working in a firm where they don't provide the insurance likewise. Earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. The vast majority of people without health insurance live in families in which the head of household is employed for at least some portion of the year. These aren't people who are the unemployed -- never getting a job. They're employed for at least some portion of the year. In my state, 76 percent of the uninsured are in families in which the head of household works full time; 85 percent have incomes above the poverty level. Now we all know it's very costly for society when individuals like these don't have health insurance. They're the ones that go into the emergency rooms of hospitals for treatments, for procedures that the hospital emergency room is not the right place. It's far too expensive for these individuals to be. Or else they don't go anywhere. And then the child or the individual, the parent, comes down with a devastating illness, that in the end costs our society far more. Controlling Costs Now the third objective is to do something about controlling costs. Cost containment is the buzzword that's used. The cost of health care in our society is getting tremendously expensive for the individual, for the companies, for states -- particularly through Medicaid -- and for our Federal Government. In the United States as a whole we spend 14 percent of our gross domestic product on health care, more than any other industrial nation. The Federal Government spends 19 percent of its budget, nearly 20 percent, nearly one-fifth of all our expenditures on health care. And that's projected to go up to 25 percent by the end of the century. And local and state governments, particularly through the cost of Medicaid for state government, spend about 15 percent. Now the country just cannot sustain these costs. You talk about what it's doing to businesses. The statistic is well known that there's a greater cost for health care involved in every automobile that's built by Chrysler and Ford, General Motors, more for health care than there is for the steel in the automobile. Twice as much we spend for health care in the United States per automobile worker per car than is spent in Japan. . . . There should be a minimal level of Government intervention. Let's not replicate Medicare, which has been fine for the beneficiaries but a disaster in terms of cost containment. That's the ultimate of the micromanagement program. It's cumbersome; it's top-heavy with regulation. It produces a 12 percent annual growth in costs, which is more than double what the private sector's going up in. . . . Now it seems to be we can begin to debate in earnest, taking up the bill produced by the distinguished majority leader, Senator Mitchell. He's worked hard to fuse the two bills in the Finance Committee and the Labor and Human Resources, which is a herculean effort. And I think we're indebted to Senator Mitchell for the effort he's made. Seeking a Consensus Now there are a number of provisions in this that cause me great concern. And the Senator from Massachusetts says, Well, Dick, list them. But just don't attack the measure. Tell us specifically what you're talking about. . . . Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe I don't read the legislation right. Maybe it's changed in the subsequent rewrite. I don't know. But the President and Senator Mitchell and others have indicated they're willing to give voluntary market solutions a try before imposing Government controls. In this bill in many areas in my judgment, that voluntary market solution effort has not been given the chance it deserves. . . . The Mitchell bill, but for the employer mandate, appears to reflect few of the principles that those of us in the mainstream have: those of us erring on the side of less government intervention, more marketplace competition and effective cost containment. . . . Does it mean we can't unite? I believe we can unite. Does it make sense for us to try for a bipartisan measure that keeps in mind the two objectives we all say we're for? I think if you ask people out here what are they for, they'd all say two things: We want to increase the number of Americans who have health insurance with our goal of eventually covering everyone. Everybody would agree with that, I think, very few not. And secondly, our objective is to get costs lower for individuals for companies for state governments and for the Federal Government. Cost containment. Nearly all of us pay tribute to the effectiveness of the marketplace. We all seem to subscribe to the notion of competition. There'd be very few people get up on the floor of this Senate and say, \"I don't believe in competition. I don't believe in the effectiveness of the marketplace.\" We subscribe to the notion of competition, those of us in the mainstream. We're for the most part extremely skeptical of government intervention. So why can't we unite behind a bill that incorporates those beliefs? . . . 'What an Opportunity' I and all the other members of the mainstream group want to see good health care reform enacted this year. We'll do all we can to be helpful. We believe it's extremely important to have a bill with broad support. What am I talking about? 75 or 80 votes in favor. That's not an impossibility. Rather than a measure that sneaks through, 51 or 52. Time is getting short, but there still remains time to produce a product that will be of great benefit to millions of Americans. What an opportunity! What a wonderful opportunity!
