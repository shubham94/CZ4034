The deal was a crowning achievement for Sanford I. Weill, Travelers' chairman. By combining Salomon, which is strong in bonds, with its Smith Barney brokerage, Travelers will rival Wall Street leaders like Merrill Lynch, American Express and Citicorp, as well as the biggest financial firms in Europe and Japan. Warren E. Buffett, who controls almost 20 percent of Salomon, will exchange his holding for a 3 percent stake in Travelers -- still significant for so large a company. The deal is likely to touch off another round of mergers among insurance concerns, brokerage firms and commercial banks. THE ECONOMY First Fear, Then Hope Durable goods orders rose 2.7 percent last month, well above analysts' expectations, to a record of nearly $186.6 billion, the Commerce Department said. The increase, the third consecutive monthly advance, reflected booming demand for electronic products. That report, combined with a report from the Labor Department that jobless claims fell unexpectedly by 2,000 the previous week, to a seasonally adjusted 306,000, renewed fears that the Federal Reserve might push up interest rates to ward off inflation. But on Friday the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew a bit more slowly in the second quarter than previously estimated. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of national economic activity, grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the quarter, down from the 3.6 percent rate reported a month ago. The new figure eased the fears of a rate increase. MARKETS Recovering From a Slide The slower economic growth, in turn, reinvigorated financial markets. Bond prices were up, sending their yields lower. The 30-year Treasury bond ended the week at 100 5/32, to yield 6.36 percent, down 1 basis point. That helped stocks recover on Friday from a three-day slide. The Nasdaq index hit a record high of 1,689.18, before ending the week at 1,682.24, up 1.87 points. Propelled by a surge of 74.17 on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 7,922.18, up 4.91 points for the week. COMPUTING I.B.M. Holds the Chips I.B.M. plans to make chips early next year that are 40 percent more powerful than the most advanced chips now made commercially. The computer maker said it had solved a fundamental problem, enabling it to use microscopic copper wiring on silicon chips, instead of the aluminum now used. The new process will also cut chip-making costs by 20 to 30 percent. Separately, Intel, which supplies the chips that are the brains of 80 percent of the world's personal computers, said the F.T.C. was investigating whether it engaged in any practices that would deter computer makers from using competitors' chips. Intel is cooperating. But no matter who makes the chips, employers want to be sure they are used for their benefit. Many are cracking down on employees who use office PC's to play games or send personal E-mail. PEOPLE Family Values Win Brenda Barnes resigned as president and chief executive of Pepsi-Cola North America, citing family reasons. ''Every time you would miss a child's birthday, or a school concert or a parent-teacher discussion, you'd feel the tug,'' said Ms. Barnes, who has three children, aged 10, 8 and 7. Pepsico, the parent company, named Philip A. Marineau, the former Quaker Oats executive who was praised for the success of Gatorade but held responsible for the decline of Snapple, to replace her. He is quitting as president of Dean Foods. . . . William H. Joyce, chief executive of Union Carbide, made a seemingly heroic gesture: If the company fails to earn $4 a share in 2000, he will return his base salary. But some compensation experts were not impressed. He'll be paid the salary, which amounts to only 20 percent of total compensation, and if the earnings fall short of the target, an amount equal to the salary will be deducted from other compensation . . . Ron Carey, the teamsters president, asserted that he was a victim, not a participant, in improper fund-raising. Three top aides have pleaded guilty; he accused them of betrayal. CABLE TV The Rates Keep Climbing Cable television rates are spiraling upward, and two consumer groups, the Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union, blamed the F.C.C., saying that it failed to keep a rein on an aggressive industry. Cable rates have risen at three times the inflation rate since the telecommunications law was passed in early 1996, the groups said. They asked the commission to freeze rates and to overhaul its formula for determining reasonable rates. TOBACCO Business Better Than Usual Tobacco industry profits could soar under terms of a legal settlement proposed in June by 40 state attorneys general and cigarette makers, according to a new analysis by the F.T.C. It said the tobacco companies could reap as much as $123 billion in additional profits in the next 25 years if the settlement plan were adopted as drafted. It found that the real cost to industry would be about $207 billion, not the stated $368.5 billion value of the settlement. On the other hand, a Stanford University economist, Jeremy I. Bulow, calculated that the industry could easily live -- and conceivably thrive -- with President Clinton's alternative plan, which calls for raising cigarette prices as much as $1.50 a pack to discourage teen-age smoking. HEALTH CARE 3 H.M.O.'s Back Regulation Three big health maintenance organizations joined two consumer groups in calling for more regulation of managed health care, saying that all health plans should be subject to ''legally enforceable national standards.'' Until now, H.M.O.'s had generally sought voluntary, not governmental, standards. But three nonprofit H.M.O.'s with a total of more than 10 million members -- Kaiser Permanente, based in California; HIP Health Insurance Plans, based in New York, and the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, based in Seattle -- said regulation was needed to restore the confidence of many patients.", "headline": {"main": "DIARY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 1013, "_id": "4fd1d5398eb7c8105d7130b6", "snippet": "WALL STREET  Travelers to Buy Salomon In $9 Billion Stock Deal  Travelers Group, a sprawling ensemble of financial services companies, agreed to acquire Salomon Inc., the Wall Street powerhouse that owns Salomon Brothers, for more than $9 billion in...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/business/diary-326747.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By JAN M.
