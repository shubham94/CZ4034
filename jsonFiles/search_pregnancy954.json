One cliffhanger wasn't good enough for this show's writers. They give viewers a half-dozen, among them George's mother (Belita Moreno) running away, his wife taking a pregnancy test and George (George Lopez, above, with Ms. Moreno) himself facing unemployment because the factory is moving to Mexico. 8 P.M. (CBS) THE AMAZING RACE -- It's too bad ''The Da Vinci Code'' is so starved for publicity. The teams on this reality-competition series face a challenge with that book (soon-to-be-a-major-motion-picture) as the theme. The connection is Leonardo's drawing ''The Vitruvian Man'' (see Chapter 13). Then they're off to Greece for bungee jumping and mud wrestling. 8:30 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- One of the eight finalists will say goodbye. 9 P.M. (13, 49) RX FOR SURVIVAL: THE HEROES -- Brad Pitt narrates this documentary about doctors, researchers and volunteers trying to take health care worldwide to people who have had little access to it. 9 P.M. (ABC) LOST -- There's talk of creating an ''S.O.S.'' signal, Jack and Kate renew their sexual chemistry, and Locke has a crisis of faith, but this all seems irrelevant in light of last week's episode. The suggestion is that the island, the plane-crash survivors and everything that happens to them are all in the mind of Hurley (Jorge Garcia, above), and he's really sitting in a psychiatric hospital, heavily medicated. 10 P.M. (CBS) CSI: NY -- One of tonight's murder victims is a college football star. The other is a good guy dressed in superhero-style cape and tights who had just saved a man from an ATM robbery. 10 P.M. (MTV) MY SUPER SWEET 16 -- This reality series about over-the-top parties given for spoiled teenagers is back with new episodes. 10 P.M. (History) 10 DAYS THAT UNEXPECTEDLY CHANGED AMERICA -- ''The Homestead Strike.'' Employees at Andrew Carnegie's Homestead steel mill near Pittsburgh endured horrific working and living conditions. They wanted better. On July 6, 1892, Andrew Clay Frick, the company's chairman, brought in an army of Pinkerton security men as union busters. But the workers had guns too. Part 8 of 10. 11 P.M. (Nickelodeon) MAD ABOUT YOU -- Yoko Ono guest-stars as herself in this 1995 episode. Paul Buchman (Paul Reiser, near left, with Helen Hunt, far left, and Ms. Ono), a striving filmmaker, wants her help.

Conservatives in Congress and anti-abortion organizations are demanding that RU-486 be withdrawn from the market. That seems premature given the uncertainties and small number of deaths in a still-unfolding story. But women seeking an abortion will need to weigh the risks and benefits carefully before deciding which method to choose. Based on admittedly shaky data, pill-induced or medical abortions look riskier and less certain to fully terminate a pregnancy than surgical abortions. Medical abortions performed in the first seven to eight weeks of gestation cause perhaps one death in every 100,000 procedures, while surgical abortions in that same period may cause only one death per million operations.", "headline": {"main": "Deaths After RU-486", "kicker": "Editorial"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "word_count": 430, "_id": "4fd2879b8eb7c8105d859678", "snippet": "Women seeking an abortion will need to weigh the risks and benefits carefully before deciding which method to choose.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/10/opinion/10mon2.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ABORTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MIFEPREX (RU-486)"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2006-04-10T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Letter", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: Re ''Prosecution of Midwife Casts Light on Home Births'' (news article, April 3):", "headline": {"main": "Delivering Babies, And Keeping It Safe"}, "abstract": "National Association of Certified Professional Midwives pres Mary Lawlor letter holds that national certification and state licensure provide pathways to assess competency of midwives and to establish appropriate routes of accountability for profession (April 3 article)", "print_page": "11", "word_count": 166, "_id": "4fd2ab848eb7c8105d8988ae", "snippet": "To the Editor:     Re ''Prosecution of Midwife Casts Light on Home Births'' (news article, April 3):", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EED61130F93AA35757C0A9609C8B63", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "LAWLOR, MARY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MIDWIVES"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2006-04-09T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Letter", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine", "lead_paragraph": "I have abundant sympathy for women who find elective induction tempting (Tina Cassidy, March 26).

Alone in the hotel lobby, I was feeling nervous; I was stood up the day before by another woman in a similar situation. I had been warned that interviewing anyone who had had an abortion in El Salvador would be difficult. The problem was not simply that in this very Catholic country a shy 24-year-old unmarried woman might feel shame telling her story to an older man. There was also the criminal stigma.

In Ms. Watt's first feature, ''Look Both Ways,'' at least some of these calamities are imaginary, arising in the disaster-prone mind of an artist named Meryl and rendered in the movie by bursts of painterly, jewel-toned animation.
