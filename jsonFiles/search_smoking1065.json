IT'S A flourishing way of life, a national obsession - an addiction, some would say - and the foundation of a multibillion dollar industry that equips, dresses, feeds and trains its practitioners. As a modern-day fountain of youth that has been shown to slow and even reverse much of the deterioration associated with aging, fitness is being pursued by millions of people who realize that their medical fate lies more in their own than in their physicians' hands. But fitness is not synonymous with health, and health is more than most people realize. Health is not just the absence of disease; it is also freedom from the often-hidden precursors of serious disease that can sneak up even on seemingly vigorous individuals. Exercise is neither a panacea nor a promise of immortality. As the benefits of exercise increasingly come under scientific scrutiny, the limitations are also becoming apparent. At best, exercise can weight the odds in your favor. At worst, it can hurt or even kill you, especially if done improperly or excessively. And without the proper genetic equipment, exercise cannot create the body beautiful. To those who faithfully follow the workouts promoted by celebrities, Dr. James S. Skinner, exercise physiologist at Arizona State University in Tempe, says, ''People don't realize they could train for 10 years and never look like Victoria Principal'' - or Jane Fonda, for that matter.", "snippet": "FITNESS IS MORE THAN A FAD.

These officers also work out, under the direction of Col. Frederick R. Drews, head of the Army's Physical Fitness Research Institute. Colonel Drews, 56 years old, has the look of a military man - with his trim torso, erect posture and close-cropped hair - but does not always think like one. In the five years since he was summoned from academia to overhaul the Army's fitness procedures and policies, he has often clashed with the standard grit-your-teeth military conditioning theories of yore. ''I don't believe that a total all-out effort in exercise or diet is the solution,'' Colonel Drews said. ''I am a firm believer in integrating the behavior component with the exercise and nutrition component.''", "snippet": "ON THE SAME BUCOLIC CAM-pus in Carlisle, Pa., where Jim Thorpe once eluded opposing tacklers, middle-aged men today jog peacefully over hill and across stream.

Baryshnikov made an exit in the first act, grabbed Marshall's arm and his own left foot and said, ''My foot - I can't put weight on it, I can't point it.'' Marshall immediately suspected a subluxated cuboid, a partial dislocation of a small bone on the side of the foot, which puts pressure on the third or fourth metatarsal. It is a fairly common problem for dancers and though not serious, causes sharp, sudden pain and total immobility in the foot. Dancing becomes a physical impossibility - as Baryshnikov's panic clearly showed. Marshall asked Baryshnikov how long he had before his next entrance. ''About four minutes,'' said the dancer. Marshall set to work, sending someone nearby for bandaging tape and telling Baryshnikov to relax. Marshall manipulated the foot. There was a loud pop, and two sighs of relief. Baryshnikov wiggled his foot and was able to stand. The pain was gone.", "snippet": "SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE filled the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles one night last year to see Mikhail Baryshnikov dance ''Giselle'' with the American Ballet Theater.
