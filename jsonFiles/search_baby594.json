Wexler is known for her high-caliber clientele -- among them Barbra Streisand, Stephanie Seymour and Candace Bushnell - and on one memorable day, three different bodyguards arrived with three different charges. (''I thought, My mother would be really proud,'' Wexler recalls.) But the patients aren't checking one another out in hopes of celebrity sightings. They're looking for ideas: is she trying something I should know about? Wexler, a petite woman with an impeccable manicure and neatly lined lips, is meanwhile speeding in and out of rooms like a character in a stage play, slamming the door on one story, opening the door onto another, and another, before circling back to the first to finish up, keeping track of the personal drama each contains. Today she leaves the room where she has just lasered one young woman's acne-damaged skin and heads into another where a tall, willowy beauty in her 40's -- a socialite whose divorce made news a few years back -- waits a bit anxiously for collagen shots to fill out the faint lines around her chin.", "headline": {"main": "The Seductress of Vanity"}, "abstract": "Susan Dominus profile of Dr Pat Wexler, New York's best-known cosmetic dermatologist, dispenser of Botox and collagen and practitioner of liposuction; photos (L)", "print_page": "48", "word_count": 3359, "_id": "4fd234188eb7c8105d7c4d8a", "snippet": "On any given workday, the waiting room of Pat Wexler, New York's best-known cosmetic dermatologist, is filled with well-preserved women flipping through magazines and eyeing one another discreetly.

Each morning, a half-dozen men huddle out front, waiting for the bank clock to strike 6 and the restaurant to unlock its doors so they can replant themselves on their rightful counter stools. By 6:45, Main Street is lined with pickup trucks, their exhaust white in the frosty air as they head over for first shift at Dresser-Rand, Wellsville's biggest employer, manufacturer of electric-generating steam turbines. Like most places, Wellsville has people with old money, new money, just enough money and no money. It's the old money -- oil money made in the nearby Pennsylvania oil fields at the turn of the last century -- that built those big homes along Main Street and gives Wellsville its special charm. As recently as 20 years ago, there were still ''oil widows'' in those elegant houses, but today it's the new money, mostly doctors, lawyers, business executives, who, for $200,000, own rambling Victorians that would go for a million or more in a New York City suburb.", "headline": {"main": "Did You Hear About Doc Ogden?"}, "abstract": "Michael Winerip article on Dr Gary Ogden, general practitioner in Wellsville, NY, whose license was suspended for a year after death of baby that was delivered under his supervision and care at local hospital, event that brought into open his serious drinking problem; says drinking was well known among townspeople and was in good part due to pressures arising from Ogden's efforts to be all things to his town and patients; says Ogden, now in Alcoholics Anonymous and subject to random alcohol monitoring, no longer practices medicine but is county health director, by all accounts doing first-rate job; describes deep impact of baby's death and Ogden's suspension on town and all involved; photos (L)", "print_page": "42", "word_count": 8357, "_id": "4fd2358a8eb7c8105d7c6f2a", "snippet": "It's early tuesday, Jan. 20, 1998, in Wellsville, N.Y., and the sky is beginning to show streaks of light over in the east, behind Madison Hill.
