In a way, it is. Each vial contains a one-milliliter dose of a product known as gp120, which has cost its manufacturer, Genentech, $100 million and untold grief. Is gp120, as some scientists believe, a crucial first approximation of the desperately needed vaccine to prevent AIDS? Or is it, as others say, nothing more than expensive dishwater? No one knows. Neither Genentech's product nor a similar vaccine made by Chiron Biocine has yet been tested enough to tell. So far, no vials have passed through the enormous steel doors to the loading dock beyond and from there into syringes and into the arms of the 10,000 volunteers whose bodies alone can answer the question. Instead, the vials sit and wait, with nothing to interrupt their silence but a workman's boom box, which suddenly sings out from the loading dock: \"Who'll Stop the Rain?\" The Eureka Moment \"I was in Nigeria for cholera in 1970,\" Don Francis says fondly, as if recalling a world's fair. \"The Sudan for Ebola virus, Phoenix for hepatitis B, just about everywhere for smallpox.\" The resume of his long career with the Centers for Disease Control reads like an itinerary of miracles. In Africa, India, Bangladesh, Francis helped eradicate terrible illnesses by the bold application of vaccine programs. But here in the United States, in his disheveled office at Genentech's headquarters on San Francisco Bay, miracles keep getting derailed. To Francis, the company's vaccine evangelist, gp120 represents the best hope yet of beating AIDS, and he is determined to test it and see. An equally determined army of opponents is arrayed against him. Perhaps that's why a ceramic figure of Sheetala Mata, the Indian goddess of smallpox, is sitting on his window ledge, embracing and supposedly blessing three vials of gp120. \"They'll need all the help they can get,\" he says.", "headline": {"main": "Who Put the Lid on gp120?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "50", "word_count": 9495, "_id": "4fd1bb928eb7c8105d6e690b", "snippet": "Some 15,000 vials of a colorless, odorless, waterlike liquid are lined up in trays in a room so cold, so remorselessly quiet, you can't help thinking of it as a tomb.
