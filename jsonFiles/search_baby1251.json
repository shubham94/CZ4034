Years after the horrors of thalidomide, amid arguments over whether an expectant mother can drink a glass of wine, smoke one cigarette or take a single aspirin without endangering her baby's health, these questions still have not been satisfactorily resolved. The current debate surrounds the decision of Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals just over a week ago to stop selling Bendectin, a prescription drug designed to combat so-called morning sickness. According to manufacturer estimates, in the 27 years during which Bendectin has been sold more than 33 million pregnant women throughout the world have used it to curb their nausea and vomiting. It is the only drug approved in the United States for treating this condition, and last year one in 10 pregnant women here used it.", "headline": {"main": "SHADOW OF DOUBT WIPES OUT BENDECTIN"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "7", "word_count": 956, "_id": "4fd12eb18eb7c8105d5fa6a2", "snippet": "Can medical researchers prove that a drug is safe during pregnancy?
