In New York City, seventh and eighth graders practice refusing cigarettes from friends. In New Orleans, junior and senior high school students meet to talk with nonsmoking members of the Saints football team because school officials believe that professional athletes as role models are more convincing than textbooks. The schools share a common goal: stopping youngsters from smoking before they start. The schools' techniques are more innovative, experts said, than those used in the 1970's. Classes now emphasize social relationships and physical fitness rather than concentrating on the long-term health hazards of smoking. School officials and health experts said it was too early to determine whether these new programs were working, although they agreed that the old programs were largely ineffective.", "snippet": "IN San Francisco, sixth graders write essays about how cigarette advertising links smoking to images of beauty, sex appeal and personal success.

IT suited someone to title this book, ''Home: A Short History of an Idea,'' but it is about comfort and the source and spread of domesticity as much as it is about ''home,'' a word which stands for a loosely bagged collection of concepts more complex and distantly historical than this book is prepared to deal with. Nor is it about an idea, really, because there is no treatment of what people have thought about private housing, or the homeland, or alienation or nationality or personal identity. It is devoted to social practices, not social theories. There is little analytic penetration of its principal notions, either, although a term like ''comfort'' badly needs it. Rather the book treats of cultural values like privacy as they became current, or conditions such as cleanliness as they began to be striven for, of feelings toward what is called the cozy or the snug, of relations of intimacy as they were increasingly sought, as well as of the significance of materials, building types, and furnishings in the service of what would become ''home, sweet home'' - including its female rulers, the habits they encourage, the objects they enshrine in their domain.", "snippet": "HOME: A Short History of an Idea.
