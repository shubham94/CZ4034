The goal is commendable: to prevent strokes and heart attacks. And the premise is logical: if people eat less salt, they'll have lower blood pressure, and this could translate into better cardiovascular health. If such a large reduction were actually to be achieved, however, New Yorkers would consume less sodium than people in most other developed countries do. And there is a possibility that such a big change in one element of their diet might have unintended harmful consequences.
