The report said that nitrites in cured meats account for ''only a small proportion of the total exposure to nitrosamines,'' a suspected cancer-causing agent, and that eliminating them ''would not have a major effect on the risk'' of cancer during a lifetime. What's more, the report said that nitrites and nitrates from other sources, such as vegetables, baked goods and cereals, might present more of a hazard than those in cured meats. The 550-page study, entitled ''The Health Effects of Nitrate, Nitrite and N-Nitroso Compounds,'' is a comprehensive accumulation of all the literature on nitrites.
