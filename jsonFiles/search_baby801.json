Opal Caples says, recalling the notice from the welfare office. ''They said we had to start working for our welfare check! I said, 'How could they do this to us?' I didn't feel it was right, to take our money -- that's for our children.'' And as a black woman living in Milwaukee's sprawling black ghetto, Caples detected a hidden agenda. No one talked about work rules in the 1930's, when ''welfare was made for middle-class white women,'' she says. ''They're really just targeting the black women.'' A bright, animated, street-smart woman who punctuates her speech with knowing glances -- you know what I'm talking about, her look insists -- Caples is telling her story on the No. 12 bus one July afternoon as it shakes and wheezes down Teutonia Avenue, past the check-cashing counters, liquor stores and lounges. She has dropped her three young daughters with her cousin, Jewel (actually with Jewel's 13-year-old nephew, Little Chuck, since Jewel wasn't around), and before long she'll be toting trash and swabbing toilets in the gastrointestinal lab of a downtown hospital. It's second-shift work and she's unhappy that her girls are asleep by the time the No. 12 shakes home. ''They don't even see me at night,'' she complains.", "headline": {"main": "Getting Opal Caples to Work"}, "abstract": "Jason DeParle article on people implementing Wisconsin's tough work requirement for welfare recipients; focuses on efforts to keep Milwaukee welfare client Opal Caples at work; notes state, using Federal funds, spends heavily on child care, health care and caseworkers to boost workfare effort; Gov Tommy G Thompson is pushing to raise grant levels to further aid workfare; photos (L)", "print_page": "33", "word_count": 7892, "_id": "4fd1f1b58eb7c8105d7486d3", "snippet": "'Ooooh, I was mad!''
