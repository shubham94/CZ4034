The drug is growth hormone, a substance that is essential for normal development in humans and animals when naturally secreted by the pituitary gland. But when artificially concentrated and taken in large doses to build muscle, it can lead to a wide variety of ailments, including diabetes, liver enlargement and bizarre warping and excessive growth of bones and joints. ''Taking growth hormone when it's not medically necessary is serious business, because you're fiddling with a very delicate chemical feedback mechanism, which may have very serious side effects,'' said Dr. Joseph Fetto, assistant professor of sports medicine at New York University.
