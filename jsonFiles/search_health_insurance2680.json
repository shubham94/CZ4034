Who can forget that noble collie who had her own show on Sunday-night TV and was a kid's best friend, there for the hugging when you needed her to be? She was an honorary member of the show's perfect nuclear family -- the whey-faced Timmy, played by Jon Provost; his earnest mother, played by June Lockhart; and his levelheaded father, played by Hugh Reilly. But it was also abundantly clear that no one was thinking of inviting Lassie in for a snack of milk and Lick 'n Crunch treats (Oreo-style cookies from Three Dog Bakery, made with carob instead of chocolate, which is bad for dogs) or of decking her out in a Swarovski-crystal heart-shaped dog tag, or of painting her nails with Opi's Pawlish. You can be just as sure that Timmy wasn't saving up his allowance to buy Lassie a $14 squeaky toy Chewy Vuitton or Jimmy Chew and that his mother wasn't stretching the household budget to cover Le Chien et Le Chat cedar-scented laundry detergent. No, Lassie belonged to an honorable but almost-extinct breed of household pet, one that knew its place in the family of man. She would never have been caught dead sleeping in a customized $400 white-crackle painted dog bed with toile linens -- would never have been caught dead sleeping anywhere but outside the farmhouse screen door, keeping an ear cocked for strange sounds.", "headline": {"main": "Let the Fur Fly", "kicker": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 5-1-05"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "21", "word_count": 2116, "_id": "4fd283a98eb7c8105d852490", "snippet": "Enough Herm\u00e8s collars and spalike kennels.
