Young people tooting horns and waving banners with Chirac's apple-tree campaign symbol pour into the Place de la Concorde for a celebratory rock concert. Chirac, a conservative neo-Gaullist promising \"fundamental change\" to a country profoundly unsettled by years of high unemployment and economic uncertainty, is sprayed with Champagne as he thanks supporters for helping him win nearly 53 percent of the vote. Then he gets into a gray Citroen sedan and heads back to the Hotel de Ville, pursued by television cameramen on motorcycles. Noisy celebrations continue thropgh the warm spring night. Six months later, reality returns with a chill. On a cold, gray afternoon, Chirac is perched on an uncomfortable green-blue settee in his gilded second-floor office of the Elysee Palace. As the light fades in the garden out back, 20,000 students are thronging the streets, this time in bitter protest against campus austerity policies and budget cuts. In a few days, the biggest wave of social unrest in a decade will break, with hundreds of thousands of transport workers closing dow' the rail network, the Paris Metro and mass transit in most other cities for three weeks.
