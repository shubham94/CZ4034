The hope for a better future in low-income housing is embodied in Lula West's new two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn. But the program that gave Miss West a decent and inexpensive home was a product of a bygone era.

Zimmer, the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat in New Jersey, began broadcasting on Sunday. Mr. Zimmer's Democratic opponent is Representative Robert G. Torricelli. PRODUCER -- Jamestown Associates, Princeton ON THE SCREEN -- Seated in front of a computer screen, a man, identified as ''net surfer,'' clicks his mouse on the word ''liberal. Mr. Torricelli appears on the computer screen, saying that he supports a ''variety of positions that are liberal.'' The man clicks three icons, ''crime,'' ''welfare'' and ''taxes.'' Each time, text appears describing Mr. Torricelli's ''too liberal'' positions. The ad closes with the words ''Foolishly Liberal'' flashing on the computer screen. THE SCRIPT -- Net Surfer: ''O.K., let's see, liberal . . . liberal . . . Torricelli.'' Mr. Torricelli: ''I certainly have a variety of positions that are liberal.'' Net Surfer: ''All right, let's see what your liberal positions are. Torricelli voted to let violent criminals go free on technicalities. . . . That's too liberal. Torricelli doesn't want people to work for their welfare benefits. He is a liberal. Torricelli voted for the biggest tax increase ever. . . . Now that's very liberal. No doubt about it. Torricelli is foolishly liberal.'' ACCURACY -- Mr. Torricelli was more liberal than 72 percent of House members last year on economics, 78 percent on social issues and 70 percent on foreign policy, the National Journal's Almanac of American Politics said. Mr. Zimmer was more liberal than 49 percent of his colleagues on economics, 54 percent on social issues and 51 percent on foreign policy. Mr. Torricelli voted against allowing the police to bypass the constitutional protections involving unlawful seizures if the police can show they made a ''good faith'' effort to comply. He voted in favor of the final version of the welfare bill, which places a five-year limit on cash benefits. He voted for President Clinton's 1993 budget, which increased taxes by $241 billion over five years, which was the largest tax increase in American history -- by one measure. But an increase signed in 1982 by President Ronald Reagan was actually larger, $286 billion, when adjusted for inflation. SCORECARD -- The word ''liberal'' is used eight times in 30 seconds. To be cast as a liberal is not such a terrible thing in New Jersey, particularly on social issues. Taxes and government spending are another issue, however, and the ad succeeds in artfully misrepresenting Mr. Torricelli's voting record on welfare spending and taxes.
