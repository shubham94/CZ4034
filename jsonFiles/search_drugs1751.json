Being denied entrance into the kingdom of Heaven may no longer be one of the primary concerns of the infertile man, but in many ways the condition is more vexatious than ever. Even those men who have coped ''successfully'' with the problem report that they were severely shaken by it. ''I think a good many men wouldn't have reacted with as much equanimity as I did - and I didn't have all that much myself,'' says one man who found out in his early 40's that he had a fertility problem. ''I didn't have any trouble with impotence, but I wouldn't be surprised if some men do. Also I was older - you do gain a certain amount of philosophical distance. But for all that, it did make me worry about my masculinity. You can know rationally that infertility has nothing to do with sexuality, but you still worry. It's one of the primal things in life.''", "headline": {"main": "FIGHTING MALE INFERTILITY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "86", "word_count": 3902, "_id": "4fd122e58eb7c8105d5e64f6", "snippet": "He that is wounded in the stones ... shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord.  - DEUTERONOMY 23:1.

From assaults by searing sun, drying wind, excessive bathing and penetrating chlorine to irritations triggered by heat, sweat and common chemicals, your skin is under constant attack from typical summertime activities. The skin is the body's largest organ, far more complex than surface appearances suggest. It serves many vital functions: It regulates body temperature, directs blood flow, shields internal organs from chemical and physical attack, holds in body fluids, keeps out invading microorganisms and manufactures vitamin D. And since it embodies the sensation of PERSONAL HEALTH touch and carries the identifying marks of individuals, the skin has also been said to serve as the principal organ of sexual attraction. The skin is also the body's most vulnerable organ, unprotected from attack from without.
