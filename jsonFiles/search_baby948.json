Barely a third of them now have health benefits, and though many are young and healthy, the work they do puts them at the mercy of the microbial free-for-all that is the immature immune system. Colds and flus are endemic, as are back problems from hefting and carting young children all day. Under the Clinton plan, workers would get benefits from their employers, who would probably qualify for an expense cap of from 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of payroll. Self-employed family day-care providers would buy their own insurance but qualify for the 100 percent health insurance tax deduction. Making health care a fact of workers' lives would almost certainly improve quality by reducing turnover. But child care is a peculiar economic institution. Technically, it is a small business, but one lacking many of the market options of other small businesses. \"Over all, the change is going to be a good thing, but we have to pay attention to consequences for child care,\" said Barbara Reisman, executive director of the Child Care Action Campaign in New York.", "headline": {"main": "At Work; Relief for Child-Care Workers"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "23", "word_count": 979, "_id": "4fd1ac628eb7c8105d6cba1a", "snippet": "AMONG small-business employees, child-care workers may have much to celebrate if President Clinton's health care proposal survives in anything like its current form.
