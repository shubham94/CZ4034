Mr. Michael Jaharis, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and humanitarian community passed away peacefully on February 17, 2016 in his home with his family by his side. Born and raised in Evanston, Illinois, Michael was the son of Greek immigrants, Michael and Katerina Jaharis, from the island of Lesvos. Shortly after his college graduation from Carroll University in June 1950, Michael was called to serve in the US Army during the Korean War and was deployed to help run the medical and pharmaceutical supply in Austria. After his service, Michael joined Miles Laboratories as a Sales Representative in the Ethical Drug Division (Prescription Drug), and earned his JD as a night student at DePaul University. Michael rose through the ranks at Miles to be appointed Vice President and Executive Legal Counsel for Food and Drug Law, where he also became involved in marketing for the company. In 1972, Michael became president and CEO of Key Pharmaceuticals, where he led his team to develop pharmaceutical breakthroughs such as sustained-release Theo-Dur, which became the nation's best selling asthma remedy, and Nitro-Dur, the first transdermal sustained-release product to release nitroglycerin through the skin. In 1988, Michael founded Kos Pharmaceuticals, where he led his team to pioneer innovative drug therapies to treat cardiovascular disease; the first product Niaspan, which raised HDL levels and improved the lives of millions of people. After selling Kos, he co-founded Vatera Healthcare Partners LLC, a New York City-based investment group focused on taking active positions in healthcare companies that develop innovative products for unmet and underserved medical needs in a broad range of therapeutic areas. In 1986, Michael and Mary founded the Jaharis Family Foundation, Inc. He was member of several non-profit and education boards: Trustee Emeritus of Tufts University, Chairman of the Board of Overseers for Tufts School of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center Board of Visitors, and Member of the Board of Overseers of the Weill Cornell Medical College and Graduate School of Medical Sciences. He and his wife were Benefactors of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Metropolitan Opera. They were Scholarship Sponsors of DePaul University College of Law in Chicago and developed the Mary and Michael Jaharis Center for Health Law at DePaul University. At Tufts University School of Medicine, they endowed the Jaharis Family Center for Biomedical and Nutrition Sciences, the Jaharis Family Chair in Family Medicine, and multiple Scholarship Funds. Through The Jaharis Family Foundation, he was also a Benefactor of Columbia University Medical College and Weill Cornell Medical College. He received an Honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from Tufts and Crown Award from Columbia University Medical. Proud of his Greek ancestry and Greek Orthodox faith, Michael served as Vice Chairman of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocesan Council, Founding Member of Faith Endowment for Orthodoxy and Hellenism and Founding Member and Executive Committee Member of Leadership 100. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America made Michael an \"Archon Exarchos of the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle,\" one of the highest honors bestowed upon laity on behalf of His All Holiness, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. Most recently, Michael and Mary directed their philanthropic efforts to supporting humanitarian initiatives to provide food, medical care and education to children and elderly living in Greece during the ongoing financial crisis and to support the refugee families fleeing to Greece. Michael Jaharis was a model of how to offer time, energy and intelligence in pursuit of a better world. He is survived by his wife Mary (nee Spyros), children Steven and Kathryn, and grandchildren Melina, Michael, Valerie, Wilder, and Ava, as well as by the millions of people whose lives he has positively impacted. Visitation hours and a funeral service will be held at the Archdiocesan Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Trinity at 337 East 74th Street, New York City. Visitation hours will be on Friday, February 19, 5:00pm - 9:30pm; the funeral service will take place on Saturday, February 20th at 11:00am. The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Rebuilding of St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church or the Cancer Programs at Columbia University Medical Center. 1/3", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  JAHARIS, MICHAEL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "29", "word_count": "693", "_id": "56d11f527988102508785acb", "snippet": "JAHARIS--Michael. 1928 - 2016.
