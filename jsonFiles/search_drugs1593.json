While the researchers acknowledge that the substance offers a quick way to become immediately sober for those who drink too much, the researchers say ethical and legal considerations may stand in its way. Scientists at the National Institute of Mental Health, in a paper to be published in the next issue of the journal Science, say the substance, a synthetic compound, blocks the intoxicating and inhibition-erasing effects of alcohol in rats. However, Dr. Peter D.

Diagnosed as having breast cancer in 1979, she had undergone a single mastectomy and two years of chemotherapy at the M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute of the University of Texas, in Houston, a leading institution for cancer research and therapy. ''We thought the cancer was all gone,'' recalled Ms. Armand, a 40-year-old mother of three children. ''But two years ago, I got sick again. I thought it was the flu - that's what it felt like.'' She returned to Houston, where doctors discovered that the cancer had spread. ''They didn't give me any hope whatsoever,'' she said. Instead of yielding to the dire prognosis, Ms. Armand went home and -on the advice of her sister, who is a physician, and a local oncologist -eventually found her way to Franklin, Tenn. There, in September 1985, doctors removed one of her cancerous ovaries, and with the tumor cells from it began to develop a new treatment for her. The experimental therapy utilizes monoclonal antibodies, biological agents drawn from the patient's own immune system and created by genetic engineering (box on page 82). The monoclonals, it is hoped, will attack Ms. Armand's cancerous cells without harming healthy cells, as chemotherapeutic drugs do.", "headline": {"main": "IN BUSINESS TO TREAT CANCER"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "68", "word_count": 4402, "_id": "4fd168988eb7c8105d657af2", "snippet": "SITTING IN HER JEF-ferson, La., home, Dale Armand mused on the cancer that had plagued her for seven years.
