And now comes a fresh blow for more than 3,000 unionized miners who will lose their health care and retirement benefits under a federal judge's ruling that it is not necessary for their troubled employer to honor its contract guarantees. Some veteran miners among the 2,300 affected retirees already suffer from black lung and other occupational diseases, but they nevertheless face loss of their medical benefits. So do 1,000 active miners, under the order of a bankruptcy judge in Kentucky. The ruling makes it easier for Horizon Natural Resources, the nation's fourth-largest coal company, to sell its six unionized mines as it undergoes bankruptcy. Potential buyers prefer the company's nonunion mines as better bargains, since they are freer of ongoing financial obligations to workers. So the order canceling medical and other contract benefits presumably levels the auction field for buyers. This is small comfort for the miners caught in the crunch of federal bankruptcy law.", "headline": {"main": "No Bed of Roses in the Mines"}, "abstract": "Editorial says more than 3,000 unionized miners will lose their health care and retirement benefits under federal judge's ruling that it is not necessary for their bankrupt employer Horizon Natural Resources to honor its contract guarantees; says this will make company's mines more attractive to potential buyers; says bankruptcy law, which has trumped miners' supposedly guaranteed benefits, must be changed", "print_page": "14", "word_count": 250, "_id": "4fd247fc8eb7c8105d7e4687", "snippet": "The lot of Appalachia's coal miners has ever been a struggle, above ground and below.
