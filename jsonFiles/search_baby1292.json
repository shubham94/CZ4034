If the President accepts this recommendation from the Government experts, as is expected, Congressional proposals to postpone the age for full retirement from 65 to 68 and to trim benefits for those choosing early retirement will be seriously endangered. Instead, Congressional attention is likely to be concentrated on potential sources of immediate savings, such as revising the formula under which Social Security benefits are adjusted annually to reflect increases in the cost of living. Government authorities have calculated that beginning next year, contributions to the Social Security fund will no longer be large enough to cover total benefits. That shortage is expected to run up to $20 billion a year for about five years before income can overtake obligations again in the late 1980's.", "headline": {"main": "CONGRESS EXPECTED TO SEEK SAVINGS ON SOCIAL SECURITY FOR SHORT TERM"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "word_count": 689, "_id": "4fd1108c8eb7c8105d5c6362", "snippet": "A group of pension experts will urge President Reagan to defer attempts at long-range changes in Social Security for the present and concentrate on the solvency crisis faced by the retirement program in the immediate future, according to...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/27/us/congress-expected-to-seek-savings-on-social-security-for-short-term.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "REFORM AND REORGANIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ECONOMY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRICES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SOCIAL SECURITY (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BUDGETS AND BUDGETING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RETIREMENT"}], "byline": {"person": [{"qualifier": "Jr.", "firstname": "Warren", "lastname": "WEAVER", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}, {"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 2}], "original": "By WARREN WEAVER Jr., Special to the New York Times"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1981-04-27T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "U.S."}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Survey of Education", "lead_paragraph": "''IWAS afraid to go to parties,'' said 13-year-old Alex Sachs, describing her life before she lost 17 pounds at a weight camp.

But at camp I relearned my eating habits, and it worked.'' The popularity of weight camps for children and adults has grown over the years, and if any stigma was ever attached to such camps, it has faded as the importance of self-image has become increasingly recognized as integral to a child's development. Ideally, a camp for weight losers should have a fully rounded activity program, and be licensed and accredited. Thus, the emphasis is not only on losing weight but also on having fun and developing skills, just like any other good summer camp. Thelma Hurwitz, who with her husband Joseph has more than a decade of experience in operating weight camps for young people, attributes some of their success to selection of mature staff members who are professionally involved in physical education and who Mrs. Hurwitz feels bring compassion and understanding to their job.", "headline": {"main": "CAMPS SPREAD FOR PUPILS THINKING THIN"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "54", "word_count": 1229, "_id": "4fd110438eb7c8105d5c5727", "snippet": "''IWAS afraid to go to parties,'' said 13-year-old Alex Sachs, describing her life before she lost 17 pounds at a weight camp.
