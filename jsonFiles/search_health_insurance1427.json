Overtime and payouts for unused vacation days sent many of those city workers' 2009 compensations over the $100,000 level. The retired deputy police chief, Charles Keohane, who left the force in mid-2009, led the pay pack, receiving $516,118 because of stored-up vacation, sick days and comp time.

He was a salesman for a struggling telecommunications company, and he was having trouble managing the strain on his finances and his family. He was sleeping poorly, and as soon as he opened his eyes in the early morning, the worries began. ''I wake up with a list of things to worry about,'' he said. ''I just go through the list, and it seems to get longer every day.'' A psychiatric interview has a certain rhythm to it. You start by listening to what your patient says for a few minutes, without interrupting, all the while sorting through possible diagnoses. This vast landscape of distress has been mapped into a series of categories in psychiatry's diagnostic manual, DSM-IV. The book breaks down mental suffering into 16 groups of disorders, like mood disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, eating disorders and several others. As I listened to J.J. (a nickname that he agreed I could use to protect his privacy), it was clear to me that he had one of the anxiety disorders, but which one? In order to systematically rule in or rule out the disorders, I asked J.J. dozens of questions. ''Do you have panic attacks?'' ''Do you get fearful in crowded situations?'' ''Have you ever experienced a traumatic event that later caused flashbacks or nightmares?''", "headline": {"main": "Mind Over Meds"}, "abstract": "Dr Daniel Carlat, Tufts University associate clinical psychiatry professor, discusses how his approach to treatment has become more psychotherapy based and less about prescribing medications; asserts that emphasis of many doctors on psychopharmacology might not serve patients or profession; notes that no other medical specialty has separate subspecialty for treatment with drugs; photo (L)", "print_page": "40", "word_count": 2999, "_id": "4fd27cf58eb7c8105d8440f1", "snippet": "One day several years ago, I was reaching the end of my first visit with a patient, J.J., who had come to see me for anxiety and insomnia.
