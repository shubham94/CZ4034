That is a lot worse than simply looking old because it means that they may have a shorter life expectancy than their age would give them. It also means that they are susceptible to serious illnesses that normally afflict older people. That is what Richard Y. discovered after being hospitalized at age 40 with severe chest pains. The frightening pains turned out to be only an inflamed tendon, but while he was in the hospital he discovered that various factors about his life had, in effect, transformed him into a man of 50 and that a real heart attack might not be so far off.", "snippet": "MOST people dread the idea of looking older than they really are, but few realize that, medically speaking, they may actually be older than their chronological age.

It therefore makes sense to focus antismoking efforts on children and adolescents before the smoking habit becomes regular; but by now, it seems abundantly clear to specialists that the traditional ''scare'' tactics warning youngsters of the diseases they risk in old age do not work very well. Youthful time horizons extend only a few days or weeks and, at any rate, peer pressures to start smoking are usually far heavier than adult pressures to resist it for health reasons. Faced with such resistance, smoking experts are developing increasingly sophisticated techniques to dissuade the very young from starting the habit. Hopeful signs continue to indicate that the national smoking habit is abating; only last week, for example, the Federal Office of Smoking and Health reported that the proportion of adult women who smoked had dropped to 29 percent, the lowest in 15 years. But there is no agreement on whether school children are following the general trend.", "snippet": "IMMORTALITY By ROBERT REINHOLD   WASHINGTON - Addiction to cigarettes often starts at a young age, as a social pastime or a means of asserting rebelliousness.
