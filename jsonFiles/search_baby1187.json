The increase would cause malpractice insurance premiums for some specialists to rise to $100,000 a year. At the same time, three Bronx physicians will go into State Supreme Court in Manhattan in an effort to block the increase and to stop another one, amounting to 52 percent, that was approved for a small malpractice insurer last month by James P. Corcoran, the State Insurance Superintendent. Mr. Corcoran said the 52 percent rise would serve as a base as all the other insurers apply for rate increases in coming months. Most of the insurance companies contend that the rate increases are necessary in the face of soaring malpractice verdicts in which million-dollar awards are becoming commonplace. But Dr. Howard S. Schwartz, a Bronx internist and one of the physicians trying to block the insurers, described the increases as ''one of the most spectacular ripoffs I've ever seen.''", "headline": {"main": "DOCTORS AND INSURERS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": 953, "_id": "4fd14eb08eb7c8105d62ed84", "snippet": "New York State's largest medical- malpractice insurer will ask the State Department of Insurance tomorrow to approve a 60 percent rate increase for the 16,500 physicians it covers in the state.

Carambolas (caram-BOH-las), or star fruit; prickly cactus pears; hot and sweet peppers of all shapes and sizes; arugula; kumquats; passion fruit, and water chestnuts share space with more familiar brussels sprouts, grapefruit and iceberg lettuce. There are fresh button mushrooms and shiitakes as well as wild mushrooms from distant mountain forests, and the kiwi, an exotic fruit of mysterious antipodal origin, has become as common in some areas as the humble apple. The reasons for this plethora of produce are many, but the most important, according to a number of retailers, wholesalers, chefs and restaurateurs interviewed recently, is America's burgeoning interest in health and fitness - and the role fresh fruits and vegetables play in a healthful diet.
