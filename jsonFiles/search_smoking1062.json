All the experts agree that, even according to the lowest estimates of risk, radon poses one of the nation's worst environmental threats, imperiling hundreds of thousands of households at least. Even those who believe that Federal officials have overstated radon's deadliness assert that the naturally formed radioactive gas is responsible for 10,000 of the nation's 130,000 annual lung cancer deaths. Several points, however, are in dispute: What is the probable cancer risk at a given level of radon exposure? How many houses have dangerous indoor radon concentrations? Above what concentration should citizens be urged to take corrective action? The Federal Environmental Protection Agency said last month that perhaps eight million homes had radon levels surpassing its recommended standard. Critics have called that number too high and have also questioned whether the risk of living in houses with moderate levels of radon, those just above the standard, is pressing enough to warrant frightening many millions of people into precipitous home renovations. These experts fear that attention will be diverted from the hundreds of thousands of households with the highest exposures, which should urgently be identified and altered.", "snippet": "NEW warnings about radon in homes, which Federal officials said last month may cause 5,000 to 20,000 lung cancer deaths a year, have touched off a row among scientists over the true extent of the hazard.
