The split signaled that any talks to form a new government would probably be protracted, as rivals try to take advantage of rifts in the alliance. A6 Syria to Assemble Parliament Syria said its president, Bashar al-Assad, would convene a session of Parliament to deliver a speech, raising expectations that he would announce a partial pullout of Syrian troops from Lebanon in an effort to ease the growing international pressure on his government. A5 Ex-Ukraine Minister's Suicide Ukraine's former interior minister, a man suspected of involvement in the abduction and murder of a prominent journalist in 2000, died in a cottage outside Kiev in what officials called a suicide. Yuri F. Kravchenko shot himself in the head hours before he was supposed to meet with prosecutors to be questioned for the first time in the case.
