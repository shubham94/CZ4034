One is that falling acids and the toxic metals associated with them are increasingly seen by scientists and public officials as a threat to people, not just to fish and forests. The other is that there are multiple signs in Washington that the question is no longer whether government should act, but rather what it should do. The Reagan Administration's position has been that not enough is known about the source of acid rain to justify an expensive program of controls on power plants and other industries. Many scientists believe it is the sulfur dioxides and nitrous oxides emitted from the tall stacks of coal-burning plants, often carried long distances by the wind, that fall as acid rain and snow or in a dry state, and, at high levels, form the acid-laden clouds and mists that bathe the mountain forests.", "snippet": "Two fundamental changes seem to be lending urgency to the North American debate about acid rain.
