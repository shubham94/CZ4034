Determined that they would not be accused of the slack supervision that helped topple the savings and loan industry, the regulators forced Shawmut to restate its 1989 results, turning a $202 million profit into a $129 million loss.", "headline": {"main": "A Bank That Lived to Tell the Tale"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2674, "_id": "4fd1d6fe8eb7c8105d714f10", "snippet": "The dark days at the Shawmut Bank started in February 1990, when an army of 170 Federal examiners arrived at the bank's main offices in Massachusetts and Connecticut for what would prove to be a six-week audit of Shawmut's real estate loans.   ...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/01/business/a-bank-that-lived-to-tell-the-tale.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "SHAWMUT BANK CONNECTICUT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INDUSTRY PROFILES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BANKS AND BANKING"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Michael", "lastname": "QUINT"}], "original": "By MICHAEL QUINT"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1992-11-01T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Business"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 27}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
