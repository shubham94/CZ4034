President Bush and Senator Edward Kennedy were supposedly working on a patients' ''bill of rights.'' There was even talk of enacting a prescription drug benefit for the elderly. But such talk has vanished. Instead a sober recognition has settled in Washington that little can be done to expand or improve health coverage while health care costs spiral out of control and the federal budget sinks deeper into deficit. Lawmakers seem to be betting that voters will not punish them for inaction. But they cannot put off the issue forever. A decade ago, when the cost of health care was also soaring, many experts were sure they had a solution -- managed care and competition. A revolution in health care delivery took place, and costs indeed seemed under control. But in the last couple of years they have gone back to rising at double-digit rates. Even the experts are shaken, because there is no magic solution this time around. Health maintenance organizations and insurance companies are not high on anyone's list of favorite enterprises. But in the current environment, lawmakers seem loath to add new requirements like a patient's right to sue, or parity between regular health care and mental health benefits, because of the cost.", "headline": {"main": "Paralysis in Health Care"}, "abstract": "Editorial says sober recognition has settled in Washington that little can be done to expand or improve health coverage while health care costs spiral out of control and federal budget sinks deeper into deficit; says lawmakers seem to think voters will not punish them for inaction, but sooner or later demand for health care will be high on agenda again, and this could happen before election in Nov", "print_page": "18", "word_count": 531, "_id": "4fd22f718eb7c8105d7bdd2f", "snippet": "Early this year Congress and the White House entertained dreams of passing all kinds of health care legislation.
