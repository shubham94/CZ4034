The researchers did caution, however, that for people who already had heart problems, there was an additional risk in jogging. ''This rate is seven times the estimated death rate from coronary heart disease during more sedentary activities in Rhode Island,'' they said, ''and suggests that exercise contributes to sudden death in susceptible persons.'' Twelve men died of heart attacks while jogging in Rhode Island from 1975 through 1980. No women who jogged suffered heart attacks. A telephone survey of state residents determined roughly how many people jog and for how long. Therefore, among male joggers aged 30 through 64 years, the approximate age span of the dead men, the incidence of death while jogging was one for every 7,620 each year, or about one death per 396,000 hours of jogging.", "snippet": "Researchers who studied all deaths among joggers in Rhode Island for six years say the risk of fatal heart attacks is less than had been believed, according to a report being published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
