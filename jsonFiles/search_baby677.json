{"status": "OK", "response": {"docs": [{"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Early this spring, long before the trees had leafed, I found myself standing in the rain in a dark field in southern New Jersey waiting for woodcocks -- shy, chunky, long-billed birds -- to rise out of the shadows and begin their mating dance. Sometimes called timberdoodles, woodcocks are not the most graceful birds on the planet. Their eyes are spaced so far apart that you might wonder how they can see the trees in front of them. As the late winter days begin to lengthen, they throw caution to the wind, and at dawn and dusk the males rise straight up into the air some 200 or 300 feet and then spiral down, uttering a plaintive, musical series of notes. Although deterred by cold, they don't seem to be bothered by rain -- and that's a good thing, too, because this ''sky dancing'' is how they maintain themselves as a species. The mystery is what was I, a devoted urbanite, doing there? I've been watching birds for six years. It all began at a brunch in Manhattan when someone happened to mention that soon the warblers would be arriving in Central Park. I didn't know what precisely warblers were, but I knew in some uncanny way that when they arrived I would go out to find them. The next day, I signed up for a course in beginning bird-watching at the New York City chapter of the Audubon Society. There were two classes and two field trips -- one to the Jamaica Bay wildlife refuge and one to Central Park. To get to Jamaica Bay, I took the A train to Broad Channel in Queens, where I saw glossy ibis and snow geese and egrets rising against the Manhattan skyline, sharing the air with jets taking off from Kennedy Airport. On the trip to Central Park, not two blocks from where I live, I saw warblers -- tiny, colorful neotropical migrants, flitting with mysterious life in the trees and bushes of the Ramble, the 36-acre woodland at the heart of the park.", "headline": {"main": "Birding at the End of Nature"}, "abstract": "Jonathan Rosen article on growing popularity of bird-watching at time when many bird populations are threatened by habitat destruction; photos (L)", "print_page": "64", "word_count": 2615, "_id": "4fd2082b8eb7c8105d772f2d", "snippet": "Early this spring, long before the trees had leafed, I found myself standing in the rain in a dark field in southern New Jersey waiting for woodcocks -- shy, chunky, long-billed birds -- to rise out of the shadows and begin their mating dance....", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/21/magazine/birding-at-the-end-of-nature.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "ENDANGERED AND EXTINCT SPECIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIRDS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Jonathan", "lastname": "Rosen"}], "original": "By Jonathan Rosen"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2000-05-21T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 224}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
