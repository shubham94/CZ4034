It was not yet noon, and Reid was in his second-floor corner office in an empty United States Capitol. He had arrived to bad news. Joseph Lieberman, the independent Connecticut senator, had announced on CBS's ''Face the Nation'' that he would not support the Senate health care plan, which meant that Reid did not have the 60 votes he needed. Lieberman's announcement, which torpedoed a compromise that Reid helped to midwife, caught the Senate majority leader by surprise. Reid had spoken with Lieberman two days earlier, and one of Lieberman's top aides participated in the Saturday-afternoon conference call that Reid orchestrates for Democratic senators who will be appearing on the Sunday talk shows. ''He double-crossed me,'' Reid said stiffly, associates later recounted. ''Let's not do what he wants. Let the bill just go down.'' Rahm Emanuel, the president's chief of staff, arrived at Reid's office not long afterward -- casually dressed, a cup of coffee in one hand -- and after a brisk meeting, a decision was reached: Reid would abandon his compromise, which was intended to appease proponents of a government-run insurance plan. The concession would not sit well with a lot of Democrats, not to mention the powerful constituency of union voters in Nevada, where Reid is up for re-election in November. But there was little discussion. Reid and Emanuel are exemplars of the just-get-it-done style of legislating. As it turned dark outside, Reid began pulling senators aside in the lobby just off the Senate floor, speaking in a strained whisper as he presented the case in characteristically pragmatic terms. ''I'm with you; I'm for you,'' he told Tom Harkin of Iowa, one of the Senate's traditional New Deal Democrats, who was pained that the public option was dying.", "headline": {"main": "Harry Reid Is Complicated.", "kicker": "MAGAZINE PREVIEW"}, "abstract": "Adam Nagourney article profiles Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who has achieved extraordinary prominence in health care negotiations; he holds enormous sway over Senate Democrats despite his propensity for saying things that get him in trouble; no matter how health care battle ends, however, Reid faces fight to retain his Senate seat; he spent almost all of 2009 as partisan leader in partisan battles, which is anathema to Nevada voters; economic anxiety that has settled over nation is high on list of election issues in Reid's home state, which has highest mortgage-foreclosure rate and among highest unemployment rates; Reid's role, then, is divided between carrying torch for Pres Obama's agenda and pleasing his constituency, roles that often appear to be at odds; photos (L)", "print_page": "26", "word_count": 5090, "_id": "4fd2b6208eb7c8105d8a9e4b", "snippet": "HARRY REID WAS HOARSE and hacking, drawn and more stooped than usual on a Sunday morning 12 days before Christmas.
