In 1964, when the Surgeon General's first report on smoking was issued, men were six times as likely as women to die of lung cancer.

They range from the environmental -- living with small children, riding the subway at rush hour, getting chilled to the bone -- to the personal -- smoking too much, exercising too little, sleeping poorly, eating erratically, working too hard. But studies under way at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh suggest that psychological stress is also a very important factor in determining who gets sick when nasal passages are invaded by a cold-causing virus. Just any old stress will not do. It has to be long-term stress, lasting at least a month and stemming from a significant problem like being fired from a job after years of service or being left financially or emotionally bereft by a divorce. The researchers point out that stress is not the cause of all colds. Rather, people under severe stress are more likely to catch cold when exposed to a virus than people under milder stress.", "snippet": "EXPLANATIONS of why people catch colds are almost as numerous as the viruses that cause colds.
