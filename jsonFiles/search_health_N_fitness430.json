He described his reactions as beginning with a prickly sensation in the mouth and throat followed by a feeling of sickness and swelling of the throat and sinuses lasting up to four hours. Every year, about 100 people die from complications associated with allergic reactions to food, and peanuts and tree nuts are often the culprits. Now researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine have taken the first small step toward preventing peanut allergy reactions in humans with an oral vaccination that seems to work on mice. Their findings appear in the current issue of the journal Nature Medicine.", "headline": {"main": "Peanut-Allergy Vaccine Clears Mice Test", "kicker": "VITAL SIGNS: REMEDIES"}, "abstract": "Researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine take first small step toward preventing peanut allergy reaction in human with oral vaccination that seems to work on mice (S)", "print_page": "8", "word_count": 405, "_id": "4fd224d98eb7c8105d7ab695", "snippet": "Jock Roy, 55, a businessman from Hanover, N.H., has suffered from peanut allergies ever since he bit into a peanut butter sandwich at a birthday party nearly 50 years ago.
