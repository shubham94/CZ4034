At the end of a decade in which one million newcomers swept into the city, 40 percent of New Yorkers are now foreign-born, the highest level since 1910. The city is enriched by the immigrants, but it also faces major challenges in helping to integrate them fully into the life and economy of the city. The earlier generations of immigrants who passed through Ellis Island were largely from Europe. The fastest-growing groups these days are from South Asia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and the nations born of the breakup of the Soviet Union. In Queens alone 167 nationalities and 116 languages coexist. That variety is one of New York's most distinctive traits. While other cities tend to attract immigrants primarily from one or two foreign regions, New York is a magnet for the whole world. The immigrants come because of the city's reputation as a point of entry and the presence of friends and relatives.", "headline": {"main": "The Gateway City"}, "abstract": "Editorial hails New York City as the metropolis that perpetually renews and enriches itself with waves of foreign immigrants; notes that 40 percent of New Yorkers today are foreign-born, highest level since 1910; says city faces major challenges in helping to integrate them fully into the life and economy of the city (M)", "print_page": "16", "word_count": 512, "_id": "4fd21a698eb7c8105d798ddf", "snippet": "New York City has long held a special place in American life as a metropolis that perpetually renews itself with waves of foreign immigration.
