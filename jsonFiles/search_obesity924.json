Deas was an intern in the obstetrics clinic at Kings County Hospital, he discovered that many black women he treated ate an unusual snack: cubes of laundry starch. The practice was believed to be a holdover from women who ate clay in Africa, but Dr. Deas quickly found that the ingested starch often caused anemia because it interfered with the body's ability to produce iron. Getting black women to stop eating starch became a seven-year crusade for the young doctor, one that proved successful and brought him national attention. In the three decades since, Dr. Deas (pronounced Dees) centered his practice of medicine in a smaller, but very appreciative arena: Jamaica, Queens.", "snippet": "In the early 1960's, when Dr. Gerald W.

As a slogan, ''Better Living Through Pharmaceuticals'' still has a campy, futuristic ring to it, but for me, at least, there's nothing sci-fi about it. Because I have H.I.V., I swallow around 800 pills of prescription drugs a month and around 400 extra pills -- vitamins, antidiarrheic, antinausea pills and the like -- to contain the side effects of the first 800. That's close to 15,000 pills a year. When I first tested positive, I had a dream that I was walking down the street shaking like a baby's rattle because there were so many pills inside me. Eight years later, that shaking has become white noise. I asked my pharmacist the other day to tote up the annual bill (which my insurance mercifully pays): $15,600, easily more than I pay separately for housing, food, travel or clothes. I'm an extreme case -- along with many others now living relatively normally with chronic illnesses -- but I'm not completely atypical. Over the last decade, as new and better prescription drugs have become our primary form of health care, our common spending on them has soared. In 1999 alone, according to a study conducted by an independent consulting group, overall expenditure on prescription drugs in America rose by 19 percent -- but only 4 percent of that was because of increased prices. We're simply taking advantage of living in the 21st century and medicating ourselves to the gills.", "snippet": "Here's an unfashionable romance: I love America's pharmaceutical companies.
