In today's mass production of poultry the bird that ends up on your table never sees the world outside its laying cage or chick box or vast broiler house, where 20,000 broilers are fattened at one time. Since the beginning of December, the Agriculture Department estimated last week, at least 225 million new baby chicks were prepared to contribute their bodies to the 11 billion pounds of chicken meat produced each year in this country's huge, factory-like poultry establishments. In the eight weeks between hatching and demise each bird is fed, injected or vaccinated with at least 20 antibiotics, minerals and vitamins designed to make it grow faster and protect it from the myriad diseases that chicken flesh in crowded conditions is heir to. The plump and, its grower hopes, tender broiler begins to receive preventive treatment even while its egg is developing in its mother, whose feed was laced with at least nine different antibiotics, growth stimulants, minerals and vitamins, some designed to improve the hatchability of her chicks.", "headline": {"main": "WHY CHICKEN LITTLE DOESN'T STAY THAT WAY LONG"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "word_count": 994, "_id": "4fd10fed8eb7c8105d5c55cc", "snippet": "WASHINGTON LONG gone are the days when laying hens, broilers, and roasters were raised in the barnyards of small farms, separated by miles from other flocks, and pecking at such bits as came their way.
