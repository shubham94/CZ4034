The lawsuit, filed in the Circuit Court for Broward County here by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, asks the court to prohibit the spraying on the grounds that there might be adverse environmental and health effects and that the use of the chemical on marijuana would be illegal under Federal law. The state court suit, which the group plans to follow with a Federal lawsuit in Washington later this week, could have both national and international impact on attempts to control the drug. The Federal Drug Enforcement Administration has encouraged the Florida project, which is to begin in the next few weeks, as a demonstration for other states and for nations where marijuana is grown before being smuggled into the United States. The plan has the backing of Gov. Bob Graham, who is a strong opponent of the drug, and of the State Attorney General, Jim Smith.", "snippet": "A pro-marijuana group filed a lawsuit today in a state court to block Florida's planned use of the herbicide paraquat to destroy the state's flourishing crop of the illegal drug.
