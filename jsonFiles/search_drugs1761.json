The animals became agitated, their hair rose, they squirmed and they displayed other outward signs of extreme alarm. These effects could be quickly halted by other chemicals. Scientists have known for years that drugs such as the benzodiazepines Librium and Valium can lessen anxiety. But the ability to create such a pure state almost instantly with a drug alone is new and unexpected, according to scientists at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md. ''For the first time we may have a reasonable understanding of the biochemistry of anxiety,'' Dr. Steven M. Paul of the institute said recently. He referred not only to his own work, but a whole body of new research at many scientific centers.", "headline": {"main": "THE BIOLOGY OF FEAR AND ANXIETY: EVIDENCE POINTS TO CHEMICAL TRIGGERS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1866, "_id": "4fd1234d8eb7c8105d5e73ba", "snippet": "INJECTIONS of a synthetic substance made for studies of the chemistry of human emotion have produced severe anxiety in monkeys within seconds.

THE potential effects of vigorous exercise on the workings of the female reproductive system have received much attention in recent years. Many of the scares have turned out to be myths. For example, the notion that running may cause the pelvic organs to ''loosen'' and ''drop'' has been discounted as the opposite of what actually happens through exercise, which strengthens the pelvic musculature and gives added support to reproductive organs.", "headline": {"main": "EFFECTS OF EXERCISE ON MENSTRUATION", "kicker": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1697, "_id": "4fd124978eb7c8105d5ea104", "snippet": "* A 14-year-old junior high school student who is an excellent swimmer was barred from interscholastic competition because she had not yet begun to menstruate.   * An 18-year-old ballerina who had trained intensively for stardom since the age of 7...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/01/garden/personal-health-effects-of-exercise-on-menstruation.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ATHLETICS AND SPORTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WOMEN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Jane", "middlename": "E.", "lastname": "Brody", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By Jane E.
