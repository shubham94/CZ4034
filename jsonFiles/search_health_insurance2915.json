But Mr. Kerry challenged the results in Ohio, and said he would not abandon his campaign until all the votes in that critical state are counted. A1 Many precincts in Ohio continued to accept voters long after they were supposed to close, delaying the count and leaving the state's critical electoral votes up in the air. P1 Republicans made significant gains in Senate races in the South, picking up seats in the Carolinas, Georgia and Louisiana and beating back a strong challenge in Kentucky, which left them well-positioned to retain their majority control. A1 House Republicans, helped by the ouster of several incumbents in Texas, maintained their majority as Democrats came up short in their drive to break their opponents' decade-old hold on the chamber. P11 The balance of the party representation of state governors was not expected to change by more than one or two seats, voting results and projections indicated. P11 President Bush spent an increasingly optimistic evening watching election returns in his family's private quarters at the White House.

P15 Democrats captured at least two seats from Republicans in the New York State Senate and ran close in two other races, putting them nearly halfway toward their long-term goal of wresting control after decades of G.O.P. dominance. P14 Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut beat back a ferocious challenge by his Democratic opponent.
