Buried in the report was the suggestion that a good diet may reduce the risk of chronic disease: a diet of nutrients from food, not pills. The study set out to determine whether the antioxidants vitamin E and beta carotene, which converts in the body to vitamin A, reduce the risk of heart disease and certain cancers. The subjects were an unhealthy population of 29,000 Finnish men over 50 with many risk factors: they were generally overweight, had used tobacco heavily and for long periods, and had high cholesterol levels and high intakes of fat and alcohol.", "snippet": "SOMETHING very important was lost last week in the furor over the findings that certain vitamin supplements may not only fail to help, but may also hurt.

As if that were not distressing enough, the study also suggested that some harm might result from daily supplements of beta carotene, which was previously considered harmless in megadoses many times higher than those needed to prevent nutritional deficiencies. Smokers who took 20 milligrams of beta carotene each day developed 18 percent more lung cancers than those who were given vitamin E or a dummy pill, and those who took 50 milligrams a day of vitamin E had a slightly higher rate (which was not statistically significant) of hemorrhagic stroke.", "snippet": "THOSE who are looking for quick fixes for their bad health habits, or who simply want an inexpensive insurance policy, received disappointing news last week when a large study of lifelong smokers in Finland revealed no apparent protection against..."}, {"word_count": 577, "slideshow_credits": null, "multimedia": [], "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "pub_date": "1994-04-17T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/17/opinion/blowing-smoke-at-congress.html", "blog": [], "_id": "4fd1e2d18eb7c8105d72bac5", "headline": {"main": "Blowing Smoke at Congress"}, "subsection_name": null, "abstract": null, "section_name": "Opinion", "byline": null, "print_page": "16", "document_type": "article", "type_of_material": "Editorial", "keywords": [{"value": "EDITORIALS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "SMOKING AND TOBACCO", "name": "subject"}], "lead_paragraph": "\"It's theater,\" a public relations adviser to a cigarette maker sneered about last week's dramatic clash between a Congressional subcommittee and executives of the seven largest American tobacco companies.
