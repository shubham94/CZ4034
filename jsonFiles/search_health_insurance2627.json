Mr. Barowitz said the bus workers would be ''fully protected'' if the Metropolitan Transportation Authority were to acquire the company -- a goal of the Bloomberg administration.

A1 Significant areas of Iraq are still not secure enough for citizens to vote, the commander of American ground forces there said. The acknowledgement came on a day when seven American soldiers were killed. The Iraqi government announced it was extending emergency rule in most areas of the country for 30 more days. A1 Paul A. Volcker says his investigation into the scandal-tainted oil-for-food program will clarify the roles of Secretary General Kofi Annan and the program's former director, Benon V. Sevan, but will not produce any ''smoking gun.'' A3 U.N. Focus on Relief Effort United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan gently prodded world leaders on how to coordinate the vast tsunami relief effort to follow through on their aid pledges, which now total more than $3 billion. Health officials are warning the death toll could still rise, unless a constant stream of assistance is maintained where poor sanitation and a lack of medical care and disease remain a threat. A12 The United States military's huge relief effort for tsunami victims is producing something of a political upheaval in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country: America is being praised, even by some of its harshest critics, while Arab countries are being questioned. A12 The tsunami also hit the eastern United States, though only the tide gauges noticed. The tsunami was so powerful that it swept around the world, with its last residual waves perceptibly jostling tide gauges from Russia's remote northeastern Pacific waters to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the Atlantic. A14 Congress passed legislation to allow taxpayers additional time to make cash donations to relief organizations addressing the disaster and claim a tax deduction for 2004.

A3 NATIONAL A16-20 Nominee Says He Opposes Torture of Terror Suspects Alberto R. Gonzales, nominated by President Bush to be attorney general, denounced the use of torture against terrorism suspects and promised to abide by international law, even as he came under attack from lawmakers over the government's treatment of prisoners. A1 Tenet Cited for 9/11 Failures An internal investigation by the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that officials who served at the highest levels of the agency, should be held accountable for failing to allocate adequate resources to combat terrorism before the Sept. 11 attacks, current and former intelligence officials say. A1 Arrest in 1964 Murders The most infamous unresolved case from America's civil rights struggle -- the 1964 abduction and killing of three voter-registration volunteers in Mississippi -- was reopened with the arrest of Edgar Ray Killen, a longtime leader of the Ku Klux Klan, the authorities announced. A1 Retrial in Drowning Case Andrea Yates, a Texas woman convicted of drowning her five children in a bathtub, was granted a new trial by an appeals court in Houston. A16 Drug Campaign Called Unlawful The investigative arm of Congress said that the Bush administration had violated federal law by producing and distributing TV news segments about the harmful effects of drug use among young people. A16 Vote Challenged, Then Ratified Congress officially ratified President Bush's election victory, but not before Democrats challenged the electoral votes from Ohio. A19 Senator Oppose Bush Plan Senator Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat whose support was essential to the enactment of President Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and his Medicare legislation in 2003, said he would oppose the president's Social Security plan this year.

The change alters the current rule that once lawmakers sign in for the day, they are counted as voting ''yes'' on all bills unless they signal otherwise. B1 Tuition Stability at SUNY The chancellor of the State University of New York proposed sweeping changes in the way the university sets its tuition, guaranteeing that each class of entering students would not face tuition increases for four years, beginning next fall. B1 School Accountants Faulted A new state audit concludes that the accounting firm chosen by the Roslyn, N.Y., school district as its fiscal watchdog was hired without competitive bidding and failed to catch rampant multimillion-dollar corruption -- even after a whistle-blower's tip on thefts of $223,000.
