Faith, family, friends: These were the cornerstones of the life of Caryl Donnelly Plunkett.

Caryl was a ray of light and a beacon of strength and energy. She lived each day to its fullest, even as she fought cancer these last ten years. Originally from Plantsville, CT, Caryl graduated from Marymount College in Tarrytown, New York. She returned to Tarrytown soon after graduation when she married William F. Plunkett Jr. and stayed for 48 years to raise their six children. She was an accomplished businesswoman, public servant and active charitable volunteer. She has been honored on several occasions for her accomplishments and good works. Marymount College awarded Caryl both the Gloria Gaines and Golden Dome awards, the highest awards bestowed on alumnae, for her years of service to the College. Caryl was a Dame in the Sovereign Order of Malta and a member of the Patron of the Arts of the Vatican Museum. She served as Chairwoman of the Zoning Board of Appeals of the Village of Tarrytown, a member of the Pregnancy Care Center of Westchester, a volunteer at Maria Fareri Children's Hospital Foundation, and a Board Member of AMIC Clearview School. In 2006, she was appointed by the Governor as Honorary Chair of the New York State Observance of United Nations Day. Always known for her quick wit and generous spirit, she was elegant, fun loving and active. She was a gracious hostess and joyful friend and colleague. More importantly, she selflessly gave her love and humor to all she came into contact with. She was happiest spending time with her family at Bantam Lake, CT or on the beach in Kiawah Island, SC. Caryl, born in 1941, is survived by her husband, Bill, their six children Ryan Plunkett, John Brendan (Jake) Plunkett, Erin Plunkett Niehaus, Kathleen Plunkett O'Connor, Timothy Plunkett, Patrick Plunkett and their spouses, and nineteen grandchildren.
