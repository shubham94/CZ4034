Beloved husband, father, grandfather, labor leader. At 93, Scott passed away after a long battle with Alzheimer's. A graduate of Monmouth College, IL, Scott became aware of the labor movement while living in Philadelphia and attending the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He began working for the Textile Workers Union of America (TWUA) in New England, but spent most of his career as the Southern Regional Director for the TWUA. Later he became head of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union's (ACTWU) textile division. Dedicated to social justice and racial equality, Scott worked tirelessly to organize southern textile plants to help workers achieve higher wages, health insurance and other benefits and to ensure fair labor practices. He was instrumental in unionizing J.P. Stevens, the historic campaign upon which the academy award winning movie \"Norma Rae\" was based.
