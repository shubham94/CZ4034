THE SHOTS FIRED BY BERNHARD GOETZ AT FOUR youths in a busy New York City subway car were heard 'round the nation. Although the same shots from a policeman's revolver would probably have stirred outrage, sympathetic reaction to Goetz's deed poured from all kinds of people, in all kinds of places. Many Americans, it seems, feel that governments are not doing the right things about random urban crime, even though that crime threatens the very existence of their cities. What triggered Goetz's bullets, and the ensuing public support for him, is the siege mentality that has changed the pattern of lives of many city dwellers and has raised new problems for the cities themselves. The public, as evidenced by polls as well as by changing behavior, is frightened. People are afraid of straying from familiarly safe and short paths of travel, afraid of changing neighborhoods, afraid of being alone in an apartment or house, afraid of people who appear unfamiliar or in some way unusual. Above all, they fear that a city so frightening that people are unable to risk assembling represents a violation of the very principle that made cities important in the first place.", "headline": {"main": "CRIME: HOW IT DESTROYS, WHAT CAN BE DONE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "19", "word_count": 5942, "_id": "4fd1603f8eb7c8105d649c3b", "snippet": "Roger Starr is a member of the editorial board of The Times.
