Most insurance companies are following the example of Mutual of Omaha, which announced in May that it would waive this restriction for clients who buy their policies immediately on making deposits for tours or cruises. Trip-cancellation and trip-interruption insurance is important to people who buy expensive cruises or tours, because emergencies, particularly health emergencies, may make it impossible to take a trip that has already been paid for. The old pre-existing conditions clauses generally held that claims to recover payments on the basis of illness of a traveler, a family member or a traveling companion were invalid if the illness \"manifested itself\" -- or some similar phrase -- in the 60 days before the insurance was bought. Often enough, this meant denial of a claim made, for example, because someone's heart condition flared up.
