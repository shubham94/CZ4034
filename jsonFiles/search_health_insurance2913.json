The valley's neighboring ''towns'' -- Boonville and Philo (combined population: 1,400) -- offer food and wine with a rich-hippie flourish. It's the ideal place to drop out and fill up for a weekend. Some local attractions: The Apple Farm 18501 Greenwood Road, Philo; (707)895-2461; go to www.philoapplefarm.com. In 1994, Sally and Don Schmitt were tired of running their Yountville restaurant, so they sold it to Thomas Keller and joined Sally's daughter on this orchard, offering weekend cooking classes and a low-key inn. Navarro Vineyards 5601 Highway 128, Philo; (707)895-3686; go to www.navarrowine.com. Philo's favorable growing conditions, combined with Navarro's sustainable business (pickers get health insurance), have yielded 12 varieties of award-winning wines. Available only at select restaurants (like Daniel and Union Square Cafe) and by mail order; you can also sample and buy at the vineyard. Lazy Creek Vineyards 4741 Highway 128, Philo; (707)895-3632. Call ahead, or, if the gate is open, drive in for big wines made on a small scale, like an oak- and butter-free chardonnay and unfiltered, dry-farmed (i.e., intense) pinot noir. Libby's Restaurant 8651 Highway 128, Philo; (707)895-2646. This Mexican restaurant dishes up scrumptious carnitas, mole enchiladas and chile rellenos. Not to be missed. The Boonville Hotel 14050 Highway 128, Boonville; (707)895-2210. Some locals roll their eyes at the zippy redesign of this hotel and restaurant, but guests certainly don't mind. The chef, John Schmitt, who grew up cooking with his mom, Sally, at the French Laundry, dreams up lush California comfort food. On Saturdays from May to October the farmer's market takes over the parking lot. Boonville General Store 17810-B Farrer Lane, Boonville; (707)895-9477. Don't let the down-home name fool you: this shop offers sophisticated soups, salads, grilled sandwiches and sometimes homemade ice cream. The store also stocks local wines, olive oils and kitchen and garden tools.

The reason is simple: most lack the home phone number needed for random sampling. To get a sense of what the cellphone generation is thinking, Education Life conducted face-to-face interviews in October at 10 campuses: Princeton, Harvard, Ohio State University, Baylor University (Waco, Tex.), University of Texas at Austin, University of Florida, University of Georgia, University of California at Santa Barbara, University of Illinois at Chicago and City University of New York-City College. Interviewers questioned 112 women and 121 men, freshmen to seniors. The students were asked what personal and political issues mattered most to them, about the war in Iraq and about long-term job prospects. In general, they were a hopeful bunch; more than 80 percent were optimistic about their futures. The looming exception was jobs, which more than 40 percent thought would be hard to find after graduation. Students were asked what the president should focus on first. These issues were mentioned most: The New York Times Jamie Patrick Chandler is an adjunct lecturer in American politics at the City University of New York. 1. Education/tuition 2. Iraq 3. Economy 4.

Is that a word? Liberalness, maybe. - Jasmine Dowell, 19 Harvard I worry most about the economy and the employment rate. I worry that all my money spent on college might be wasted.'' - Dionysios Tsalcalis, 26 Ohio State University Rising tuition cost because of insufficient federal funding.'' - Linda Do, 20 University of Texas at Austin I think that eventually it will get to a draft. The way we struggle to keep control in Iraq, the way we keep dedicating military power around the world, more people will be needed. The prospect of a draft is a political tool.'' - Jeff Krisko, 18 University of California at Santa Barbara I am currently an engineering major, and I don't want to have my job handed to someone in another country just so companies can increase profit. It happened with computer science. It can happen to engineering. - Urribarri Abhay, 17 CUNY-City College As a double major in economics and political science, the issue that worries me the most would have to be the subpar operation of the Federal Reserve in that it has kept the prime rate too low for too long, thereby creating the potential for hyperinflation.'' - Joseph Siegrist, 21 Ohio State University First, kill the terrorists before they kill me. Second, the meltdown of our culture due to the idea of relativism. - Mark Roehrenbeck, 22 Ohio State University Speaking up more during discussions. Getting to class on time, especially when I have only 10 minutes between classes. Time management. - Angie Nguyen, 18 University of California at Santa Barbara I'm a pretty free-go-lucky guy. I'm not really worried.'' - Sam Yoffe, 19 University of Florida I feel that most Americans are so uninvolved with the political aspect of their lives. They're complacent with others deciding for them and then ultimately deciding for me. That's alarming.'' - Kimberly Blitch, 18 University of Georgia Please think about education! Wars, terrorism, whatever -- do that on your own time, Mr. Pres. - Travis Moak, 22 University of Georgia Education is the key to helping solve problems in the world, such as global warming, globalization, gene therapy and cultural toleration. Equalizing the opportunity for education to all should be the president's No. 1 issue. Education should not be last on the list when it comes to budget expense and first on the list when it comes to budget cuts. - Jill Smiley, 21 Ohio State University Medical care.
