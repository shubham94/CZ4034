Though Meisner claimed a prior engagement, skeptics suspected otherwise. Meisner had insisted that only a figurative depiction of 20th-century Catholic martyrs could substitute for the original Gothic window, which was destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II and never suitably replaced. Richter, however, delivered something wholly unexpected: an abstract composition of 11,500 identically sized units -- at 14.5 square inches each, they are frequently compared to pixels -- in 72 colors, the arrangement of which was determined randomly by a computer program. Richter originally produced two drafts for the window, each portraying the Nazi execution of innocents. But he ultimately concluded that ''figurative'' was something he simply could not do. ''I was not able to make something of it,'' he says. Any representational image would have been tiresomely dissected for meanings religious, political, symbolic. There were also more mundane reasons. As the cathedral's master builder, Barbara Schock-Werner, writes in a catalog essay for the window, ''How could such a depiction be realized other than in gloomy, oppressive colors?''
