Glenn (letter, April 3) made inaccurate statements in responding to ''A Matter of Fat'' (Op-Ed, March 16) by William Bennett and Joel Gurin, on a National Institutes of Health report on obesity. Dr. Glenn denies there is ''one shred of evidence'' for the idea that cycles of weight loss and regain (''the yo-yo syndrome'') may be the true culprit for the ills suffered by the obese. Having recently written part of my Ph.D. thesis on weight loss and regain, I wish to assure readers that ''the danger of ups and downs'' is supported by more than 100 scientific reports. Harmful cardiovascular effects have been demonstrated in dogs, swine, mice and rats, as well as in humans regaining weight after wartime famines or severe reducing diets. When humans or laboratory animals, lean as well as obese, are starved, blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol fall almost immediately, the direct effect of eating less. Thousands of medical reports have detailed these short-term changes in dieters, but only a handful have looked at the consequences. As weight is regained, blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol skyrocket far above original levels. The benefit of dieting is quickly undone, leaving the individual considerably worse for the wear.", "snippet": "To the Editor:   Dr. Morton B.
