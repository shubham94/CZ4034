GRACE JACOBS Cliffside Park More Than 'Mistakes' Everyone makes mistakes, it's true, but I find it appalling to put the creation and dismissal of a life in the same category as running a red light or taking a wrong turn on a road or forgetting your homework. That's how I hear unwanted pregnancies described, and that's how I hear the Grossberg-Peterson murder described: just kids who made a mistake. I'd like to think creation is more sacred and deserves our utmost respect. CHRISTINE VARTANIAN Queens, N.Y. Education Not Sticking The thing I found most disturbing was Amy's notes to Brian saying she couldn't wait until this was over so they could have sex again because she felt ugly being pregnant. They saw the pregnancy as an annoyance. It's amazing that in the late 90's, sex ed class doesn't stick in these kids' heads, and the parents are too immature or ignorant to explain sex (and its risks and consequences) to their kids. K.C. JACKSON Teaneck He Behaved Worse In terms of whose behavior was worse the night of the birth, I vote for Brian Peterson. Amy was involved in drug-free childbirth -- not usually a pleasant experience -- and Brian was there apparently to assist. He should have been the more clear-headed of the two and had the option to take the baby and run for the nearest phone to dial 911 instead of running for the nearest Dumpster to throw it in.
