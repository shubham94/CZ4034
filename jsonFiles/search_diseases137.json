{"status": "OK", "response": {"docs": [{"type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Classified", "lead_paragraph": "STERNFELD--Leon, MD, PhD, MPH, died at his home in Oakland, CA., on Monday, November 24. Born in Brooklyn, NY on June 15, 1913 to Jewish immigrant parents, Leon spent his earliest years in a Labor Zionist agricultural community in Clarion, Utah. After the outbreak of World War I, with economic opportunities opening up in the big cities, Leon and his parents moved to Chicago, IL, where he grew up. He attended college and medical school at the University of Chicago, where he also earned a doctoral degree in biochemistry. As a teenager in Chicago, he met his future wife, Ruth Schwartz, to whom he was married for 73 years, and with whom he raised two daughters, Kay and Barbara. After completing an internship in pediatrics and communicable diseases at Johns Hopkins and a residency in pediatrics at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, Leon took a Public Health Traineeship with the New York State Department of Health; during that time, he completed a Masters of Public Health in Maternal and Child Health at Columbia University. He then worked as Director of the Bureau of Medical Rehabilitation in the NY State Department of Health until 1950 when he took a position as Assistant Director, Tuberculosis Control, in the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. After a tour of active duty as Chief of the Public Health Administration in South Korea, Leon returned to Massachusetts, serving first as Commissioner of Health in Cambridge and then as Deputy Commissioner in the state Department of Public Health. In 1970, Leon and Ruth moved to New York City where he served as the Medical Director of the United Cerebral Palsy Association and United Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation until he retired in 1993. In 1991, he was recognized by the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine with a Distinguished Service Award, and in 1998, he was honored with the Research and Public Health Leadership award from Life Services for the Handicapped. Leon was the patriarch and anchor for the extended Sternfeld clan, full of wisdom and practical advice and always ready with his infectiously positive attitude, quick wit, humor and contagious laugh. He is survived by his daughter, Barbara, of Kensington, CA, his brother-in-law, Leo Sreebny of Seattle, WA, his son-in-law, Virgil Vickers of Newton, MA, his granddaughter, Rani Vickers Dalton, and great-granddaughter, Kayley Dalton, of Waltham, MA, as well as his step-grandson and family, Michael and JoLynn Carroll and their children, Julia and Phillip, of Tromso, Norway, and many loving nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his wife, Ruth, and daughter, Kay. Donations in his memory may be sent to the American Museum of Natural History in New York or the United Cerebral Palsy Associations. 1/3", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  STERNFELD, LEON"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "36", "word_count": "452", "_id": "548e5d3479881018ac4ba266", "snippet": "STERNFELD--Leon, MD, PhD, MPH, died at his home in Oakland, CA., on Monday, November 24.
