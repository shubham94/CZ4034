Rahal M.D. James J. Rahal, M.D. The world of medicine, and the world, lost a giant this weekend as Dr. James Rahal passed away. His many colleagues at New York Hospital Queens join, in deep sadness, his beloved family his wife Barbara Britton, his children James, Susan and Linda as well as his grandchildren Karyn, Carly and Christine, to mourn his death. We also celebrate his successes on the frontlines of the battle against some of the most challenging diseases of our time. Jim, as we all knew him, had a distinguished and productive career that spanned more than four decades. He dedicated his professional life to being a physician, scientist and professor in infectious disease and infection control. He achieved his undergraduate degree from Harvard-cum laude; and earned his medical degree from Tufts University-cum laude in 1959. He came to New York Hospital Queens as Director of Infectious Disease in 1988, and beyond the enormous contributions he made to the medical center's patients and his colleagues, he shaped the Infectious Disease specialists of the future as a clinical professor of medicine for Weill Medical College of Cornell University. In the 1980s and 1990s, he was recognized internationally as the scientific leader who discovered, and then published, his findings on the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. He was among the first to participate in trials with the then new cephalosporins. His work on multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli has led the field and is often quoted. When HIV/AIDS emerged as a growing public health issue, he became actively involved in addressing innovative drug therapies, patient access to treatment and public policy decisions. Most significantly, he served as a member of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Data Safety Monitoring Board - a small group of multidisciplinary specialists, who determined the safety of national studies for HIV/AIDS. In 1999, he was one of the first physicians in the U.S. to recognize the outbreak pattern of the West Nile virus when it began infecting patients in Queens. He became one of the nation's foremost experts on the West Nile virus. He developed the first FDA-approved treatment for the West Nile virus in 2002, and he created a national, multi-site research protocol to determine the results of the Interferon alpha-2b for treatment of the virus. This unique protocol was patented in 2005. On a personal level, Dr. Rahal was recognized for his self-effacing and gracious manner. He was a consummate teacher and as a result, he received countless awards for teaching and research--including the Albion Bernstein MD Award in 2004 by the Medical Society of the State of New York. His work has been published in numerous prestigious journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA and Science magazine. The news media often sought his expertise on antibiotic resistance, the West Nile virus and infectious diseases. His studies, including those developed for the NIH, have affected many lives and have served to raise the bar of excellence in medicine and science for future generations.
