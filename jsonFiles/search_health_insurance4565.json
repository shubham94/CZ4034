But an announcement this week that the Long Island Lighting Company was selling some of its pollution rights to another company has raised fears in New York's environmental community. Because the law does not regulate the sales or require companies to provide any public information about them, at least until 1995, pollution could be quietly shifted from one region to another, critics say. Page 1. NEW YORK CITY JANUARY JOBLESS RATE HIGHEST ON RECORD The unemployment rate for New York City soared to 13.4 percent in January from 11 percent in December, hitting the highest level on record in the 25 years that the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics has tracked the city labor market. There were 447,000 people out of work in January, excluding those who have dropped out of the labor market and are not actively seeking jobs. That number, up from 369,000 in December, was also the highest on record. Page 1. AMTRAK ORDERED TO ALLOW BILLBOARD A Federal judge ruled that Amtrak must permit an artist to display a montage criticizing the owners of the Coors Brewing Company on a giant billboard in Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. Amtrak had rejected the artist's montage of pictures and text on the ground that it had a policy of barring political advertising. Page 25. EX-BLACKBURNE ADVISER PLEADS GUILTY The former top tenant adviser to the New York City Housing Authority pleaded guilty in Federal Court in Manhattan to embezzling $32,000 in a case that law-enforcement officials said the authority's former chairwoman, Laura D. Blackburne, tried to keep quiet. Page 25. REGION FALSE ALARM ON INSURANCE Although there were dire predictions last year that commercial insurance companies would cancel health coverage for thousands of small businesses and individuals if New York State changed its rules governing rates, the outlook now seems far less grim. Page 26. NEW JERSEY HATS IN IMUS'S THREE RINGS Don Imus, the radio talk-show host, is insinuating himself into the New Jersey race for Governor, to the delight of Gov. Jim Florio and the chagrin of his opponents. Candidates for offices from President on down have repeatedly knocked on his door in the hope of appearing more human during a freewheeling conversation with Mr. Imus. Page 26. 'WHITE FLIGHT' TESTIMONY IN SCHOOLS CASE Large numbers of whites have removed their children from public schools wherever mandatory integration plans have been imposed, an expert testified in the state's defense against a suit challenging the racial and economic segregation in Hartford's schools.

VOTE NEARS ON SECOND WEAPONS BILL Faced with uncertain prospects of overriding Governor Florio's veto of a bill that would have ended a ban nearly all two semiautomatic guns, the New Jersey Senate is expected to vote Tuesday on an plan that would allow some 200,000 current owners to keep their guns.
