These were not the same drivers who had taken Annan to his repeated negotiating sessions at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; these were Saddam Hussein's personal drivers, among the very few people permitted to know the Iraqi President's whereabouts. They had come to take the Secretary General to his climactic negotiating session with Saddam. Annan was told that he could take no more than three aides and his bodyguard. He was not told where he was going. He didn't seem fazed; Annan never seems fazed. Ahmad Fawzi, the spokesman for Annan's delegation, asked one of the Iraqis where the Secretary General was being taken. ''He looked at me like I was a cockroach,'' Fawzi said later.
