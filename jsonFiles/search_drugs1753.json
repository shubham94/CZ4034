Although it is true that some savings may accrue to the public and greater profits to the pharmacists by substituting one drug product for another, this must be measured against jeopardizing the patient's course of treatment, particularly among the young and elderly, if the substituted product does not have the desired therapeutic effect. The evidence is clear. Individual manufacturers of both branded and generic drug products will generally produce quality medications which are, nevertheless, not therapeutically interchangeable.Although all of the products may contain the same amount of the active ingredient, the amount and rate at which it gets into the bloodstream (bioavailability) can vary considerably due to differences in the formulation of the products.", "headline": {"main": "WHY SUBSTITUTING GENERIC DRUGS COULD BE A HEALTH HAZARD"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": 501, "_id": "4fd1374f8eb7c8105d609c5d", "snippet": "To the Editor:    In his plea for modification of state generic substitution laws in order to ''give pharmacists a financial incentive to promote widespread generic dispensing'' of drug products, Allan Wagner (letter June 9) has unfortunately placed...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/26/opinion/l-why-substituting-generic-drugs-could-be-a-health-hazard-236030.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS AND DRUG TRADE"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1982-06-26T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Living Desk", "lead_paragraph": "THE first time I went snorkeling I got so excited by the wealth of creatures swimming around me that I stuck my head up and called to no one in particular: ''C-c-c-ome quick! L-l-l-look at this!'' I don't usually stutter, but now and again certain circumstances, among them times of extreme excitement, fear, urgency or anger, cause me to trip over my own words. That is nothing unusual; everyone stutters some of the time. But for about one person in a hundred stuttering is a chronic plague that interferes with school performance, job opportunities, social interaction, self-esteem and the enjoyment of life. Though the problem has been with humankind for thousands of years, it has defied explanation and definitive therapy - not that there is any shortage of theories or of therapeutic effort. Old notions focused on the tongue, which was thought to be too thick, too large, too dry or too stiff (the treatments this engendered were gruesome, to say the least). Some proposed that a terrible fright at an early age was responsible, perhaps even an event that befell the mother during pregnancy. Others blamed imitation of a stuttering parent, sibling or friend, or confusion triggered by the effort to make left-handed people use their right hands.", "headline": {"main": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": 1442, "_id": "4fd122db8eb7c8105d5e5dec", "snippet": "THE first time I went snorkeling I got so excited by the wealth of creatures swimming around me that I stuck my head up and called to no one in particular: ''C-c-c-ome quick!
