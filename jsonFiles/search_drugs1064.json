With leeches, acupuncture needles, vitamin pills or whatever stage prop is appropriate for the time and culture, the healer artfully evokes the patient's powers of self-suggestion, which are responsible for whatever healing may occur. Western medicine operates on a different plane. For one thing, it has the most impressive props -- expensive medicines, elaborate rituals and mysterious high-tech machines with a white-gowned cast to operate them. For another, it evokes the patient's autosuggestive powers all the more forcefully by pretending to ignore them. This mysterious gift of self-healing is cloaked with an anodyne label, the \"placebo effect,\" and recognized only as a nuisance likely to confound clinical trials. But the placebo (Latin for \"I will please\") and its shadowy twin the nocebo (\"I will harm\") are much more than methodological problems: they lie at the heart of every interaction between doctor and patient.", "headline": {"main": "Method & Madness;The Spin Doctors"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "16", "word_count": 1162, "_id": "4fd1d2ea8eb7c8105d70ec50", "snippet": "MOST SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE ARE based on theater.
