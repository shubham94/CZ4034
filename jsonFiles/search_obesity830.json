And those of us who are patients and insurance beneficiaries are implicated also. Let's take another look at Jim Levine's day. Eight sore throats: these are almost always viral. The normal immune system can easily handle these viruses, and the patient will feel better in a week. Young, healthy, asymptomatic Americans do not need annual physicals; at most, they need a blood-pressure check (high blood pressure has no symptoms) and, in their 30's, a cholesterol test. Young people with no symptoms and no risk factors for heart disease need no more than one EKG, for baseline. Obesity is a major health problem in the country, but Weight Watchers and the public health system can address it more effectively and efficiently than I can. In other words, many of Levine's patients need not have visited the doctor at all that day. And with those patients off his schedule, there would have been more time for people who need his care. However, his patients had insurance; he needs to support a family; and it is safer to see healthy patients with trivial complaints, especially if time is short.

A Senate committee held hearings this week on a bill designed to combat the obesity epidemic in this country, where some 60 percent of all American adults are either overweight or obese. And the annual meeting of the World Health Organization heard reports of an alarming increase in overweight children in developing countries, some of which are fast closing the gap with the traditionally fatter industrialized nations. A favorite villain in most analyses of the global girth problem is the so-called junk foods -- the sodas, chips and candy bars that tend to be high in calories and low in nutritional value. That is why efforts are under way in several states to restrict the availability of junk food in the public schools, as chronicled by Timothy Egan in Monday's Times. But it is an uphill battle given the lobbying might of the food industry and the financial interests of school districts that profit from vending machine sales on their premises.", "snippet": "The eve of a long holiday weekend may not be the most propitious time to rail against junk food, but we feel duty bound to note that obesity was back in the spotlight this month as a major public health problem.
