That would please many of the elderly, who prefer to stay at home near friends and family as long as possible. It would also please state and federal Medicaid administrators, whose budgets are swamped with the high cost of nursing home care for elderly patients. No wonder the Bush administration has encouraged states to experiment with home- or community-based care under so-called Medicaid waivers, and no wonder many governors have responded enthusiastically. The trouble is, in many cases no one seems to be monitoring the quality of the care provided, or even whether it is provided at all. A new report from the General Accounting Office -- described by Robert Pear yesterday in The Times -- lays bare the nature of the problem. While the administration has been boasting about the record number of waivers it has granted, it has not adequately monitored the programs or ensured that the states do so. In many cases, the state waiver programs failed to provide necessary services or adequate nutrition and did not properly assess the needs of patients.
