The state will also begin an employment program to help welfare recipients upgrade their skills and find work. The guidelines went into effect July 1. Since 1988 the number of people receiving general assistance in Connecticut increased to 34,000 from 11,000. The program, one of several components of the welfare system in Connecticut, provides monthly grants of $314 for people who are able but cannot find work and $356 for those who are unemployable because of medical problems.
