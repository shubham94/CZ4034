The Board of Trustees and members institutions of the Catholic Health Care system of the Archdiocese of New York mourn the loss of the beloved Shepherd of the Archdiocese who has gone to his eternal rest to be with Our Lord. A defender and champion of the poor, the sick, vulnerable and all those who are marginalized. His Eminence brought Christ's healing presence to those most in need. In the way he lived his life and the grace with which he faced his death, His Eminence was an inspiration to all of those dedicated to fulfilling the Church's healing ministry through the hospitals and nursing homes of the Archdiocese's Catholic Health Care System. His commitment to life-from his staunch advocacy for the unborn to his support of the tiniest of infants who began life at Our Lady of Mercy's neonatal unit; from the AIDS patients, whom he visited in nightly unannounced visits at St. Clare's Hospital to those who suffered with Huntington's Disease and were cared for at Terence Cooke Health Care Center; from those who were ravaged with the end stages of cancer and found compassion at Calvary Hospital and the sick who were treated at St. Agnes Hospital to the elderly cared for at Carmel Richmond, Ferncliff, Kateri, Mary Manning Walsh, St. Vincent dePaul, Terence Cardinal Cooke and St. Teresa's nursing homes, -whether through his actions or his prayers, touched us all. His faith in Our Lord was unwavering. His will to serve was inspiring. As Archbishop, his reach extended beyond Archdiocesean borders. Though truly a world leader, His Eminence was first and foremost a priest who followed his calling. As concerned with those who did not have adequate health care in Africa, the Caribbean, Central and South America and around the world as he was with those in New York, his legacy will perhaps best be measured by the care received by those whom he did not know and who in turn may not have even known his name. Despite his extraordinarily demanding schedule he always had time for a quiet moment of counsel, praise and gratitude to those who so willingly served under him. It was an honor and a privilege to do so, and for that we are eternally grateful. Our prayers go out to the Cardinal's immediate family and his extended family of New York. As beloved as he was in life so too will he be missed in death. As we pray for his soul, we also pray that his light may continue to shine upon us all. May the Lord grant him eternal peace. Donations to support the Archdiocese's health care ministry may be made in the Cardinal's name to: Providence Health Services Foundation, 155 E. 56 St, 2 Floor, New York, NY 10022 Mary Healey-Sedutto, Ph.D President & CEO Edwin S.

The Board of Trustees and staff of Our Lady of Mercy Healthcare System, Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center and Saint Agnes Hospital and Children's Rehabilitation Center acknowledge with a deep sense of personal loss the passing of His Eminence, John Cardinal O'Connor. His Eminence made extraordinary personal contributions to health care and education and tireless efforts to reestablish and revitalize the essential Catholic mission, that of providing the highest quality health care for everyone. We at Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center were very honored that His Eminence allowed us to name our Medical Center Campus at East 233rd Street in the Bronx in his honor. His Eminence had a particular fondness for our program at Rosalie Hall, our 28bed residence and shelter program for single mothers. He was very grateful that our medical center had a strong interest in the elderly, as well as our fragile newborns. He always emphasized the importance of taking care of the needs of those just entereing the world and those at the end of life. The lives that he touched will never be the same. We will miss him. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family, the auxiliary bishops and the priests, religious and laity of the Archdiocese of New York. Edwin S.

The Board of Trustees of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York wishes to express profound sorrow and a deep sense of personal loss at the death of His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York and President of this charitable Federation. Throughout a lifetime characterized by extraordinary accomplishments and service, Cardinal O'Connor was foremost and preeminently a dedicated priest, imbued with love of God and love for all God's people. His leadership and many initiatives on behalf of the poor and disadvantaged of the Archdiocese have been a source of untold strength to this Board and a special blessing from Almighty God. With loving concern, our Good Shepherd recognized the demands of our changing times and encouraged tirelessly the development of many new programs for the benefit of children and youth, recent immigrants and refugees, the aged, the homeless, handicapped and the sick. As the Shepherd of God's people, his concerns were universal as he devoted himself with apostolic charity and zeal to the welfare and the best interest of all, not only in New York but throughout the United States, the Americas and the Third World. We thank Almighty God for sharing with us the faith and wisdom, the strength and the talents of his devoted servant, John Cardinal O'Connor.

The American Jewish Committee deeply mourns the death of His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor, and we extend our profound sympathy to his family and the Archdiocese of New York. His remarkable leadership building human bridges of solidarity between Catholics and Jews is indelible. The Cardinal was at the forefront in the struggle to free Soviet Jews, to eradicate every vestige of antiSemitism, to commemorate the Holocaust, and to establish diplomatic relations between the Vatican and the State of Israel. In 1990 the AJC proudly presented Cardinal O'Connor with the Isaiah Interreligious Award, and during his distinguished tenure as New York's Archbishop, the Cardinal worked closely with us on a host of issues including healing the wounds of war in the Balkans and strengthening human rights throughout the world. Most of all we will always remember the Cardinal's warm smile, his exquisite sense of grace and humor, his constant wise counsel, and his esteem for Judaism and the Jewish people. We will sorely miss him. May the memory of this extraordinary man of faith forever be a blessing. Bruce M. Ramer, President Dottie Bennett, Chair Interreligious Commission David A. Harris, Exec.

Cardinal O'Connor supported working people with every fiber of his being, earning him the title ''Patron Saint of Working People'' among our members. He learned respect for labor's rights from his father, a dedicated union member. The Cardinal championed workers' rights to organize, to bargain for a decent living, and to strike. He did so in deed as well as word. Cardinal O'Connor's humanitarian ideals made him a passionate advocate for those in need. He was a giant who rose above denominational differences, who spoke for the best that is in every one of us. When a group of labor leaders visited him in March, he told us, ''Without the unions, working people would have nothing.'' He urged us to continue our efforts on behalf of working people. In his memory, with love, sorrow and determination, we pledge to do so. Dennis Rivera, President 1199/SEIU O'CONNOR-John, Cardinal.
