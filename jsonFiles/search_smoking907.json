Exposure to the chemical, once thought to be much more hazardous than chain smoking, is now considered by some experts to be no more risky than spending a week sunbathing. For years the Federal Government has required industrial companies to invest billions of dollars to prevent dioxin's release into the environment and to clean up what is already there. In the most dramatic move to protect citizens, the Government in 1982 and early 1983 permanently evacuated all 2,240 residents of Times Beach, Mo., where the dirt roads had become contaminated with dioxin. Review Is Begun But now some scientists believe that the Government's stringent health standards for dioxin are not supported by the latest scientific evidence. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency has opened a yearlong review to develop a new formal opinion of the risks of dioxin. \"I don't want to prejudge the issue, but we are seeing new information on dioxin that suggests a lower risk assessment for dioxin should be applied,\" said William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who asked for the review. \"I know the stakes and that I'm unraveling something here,\" Mr. Reilly said. \"There is not much precedence in the Federal establishment for pulling back from a judgment of toxicity. But we need to be prepared to adjust, to raise or lower standards, as new science becomes available.\" Hindsight on Evacuation The human dimension of this change in approach emerged most vividly several months ago when the Federal scientist who made the original decision to evacuate Times Beach said he believed he had erred. \"We used the best scientific evidence at the time to make the decision we did,\" said the scientist, Dr. Vernon N. Houk. \"Given what we now know about this chemical's toxicity and its effects on human health, it looks as though the evacuation was unnecessary,\" Dr. Houk, the assistant Surgeon General and Director of the Center for Environmental Health and Injury Control at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said in a recent interview. Environmental groups say the latest data confirm the original assessment of dioxin's danger, and they assert that the Government's changing position is a political move aimed at reducing pollution control and cleanup costs for industry. But Dr. Houk said, \"If it's a carcinogen, it's a very weak carcinogen and Federal policy needs to reflect that.\" The revised view of the dangers of dioxin has raised serious concern in the E.P.A., which used many of the same procedures to determine the hazards of dioxin as it did to set air and water pollution limits for most of the other chemicals that the agency regulates. If Dr. Houk is right and dioxin is much less dangerous than had been determined, that could mean the Government's regulations for other compounds will need to be adjusted. Under the current Federal guidelines, the E.P.A. says that ingesting more than .006 trillionths of a gram of dioxin for each kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight daily over an average lifetime may cause one fatal cancer among each million people. Thus a man weighing 80 kilograms, or 176 pounds, is urged by the Government not to eat, drink, or breathe more than 0.5 trillionths of a gram of dioxin every day. Such an amount would be roughly equivalent to slicing a grain of sand a billion times. Standard Used for Water The same statistical method used to calculate the safe exposure to dioxin was also used by the Environmental Protection Agency to set a safe level in water of 13 parts per quintillion and by the Centers for Disease Control at 1 part per billion in soil. The World Health Organization supports the revised view of dioxin's danger and suggests that the United States exposure standards are wrong. Earlier this year the group officially set a new limit for the daily intake of dioxin at 10 trillionths of a gram of dioxin per kilogram of body weight, a concentration that is 1,600 times greater than the level set by the Environmental Protection Agency and closer to the concentration considered scientifically accurate by Dr. Houk and others. Scientists at leading environmental groups say the Government's original assessment of dioxin's dangers is supported by the new data. They also contend that the researchers are narrowly interpreting the new data to reduce the cleanup and disposal costs of industries whose manufacturing processes produce dioxin as a byproduct, particularly paper pulp mills, hazardous waste incinerators and municipal incinerators. \"Nothing that has been learned about dioxin since 1985 when E.P.A. first published its risk assessment finding on dioxin in the environment supports a revision of science-based policy or action,\" said Dr. Ellen K. Silbergeld, professor of pathology at the University of Maryland in Baltimore. \"We know more about the cellular events that appear to underlie dioxin's multiple toxic effects, and what we know confirms that it is a remarkably potent agent.\" 'Protected Industries' Dr. Mary H. O'Brien, a botanist and a director of the Dioxin-Organochlorines Center, a research group in Eugene, Ore., said: \"What's being protected here is not people or the environment but industries favored by the Government. The Government begins with the assumption that these industrial activities have to go on and they adjust the data to make the existing pollution practices acceptable.\" Soil at 28 sites in the St. Louis region, including Times Beach, was found to be contaminated with dioxin at levels higher than 1,000 parts per billion. Because the Centers for Disease Control thought the exposure to dioxin would be highest at Times Beach, the state and Federal governments bought the property of residents for $37 million. Cost at $100 Million Cleanup work at the other sites has been going on for a decade and has cost $100 million. About 100,000 cubic yards of soil contaminated with dioxin from the sites is being stored, awaiting the construction of an incinerator at Times Beach. It is expected to take 10 more years and cost $150 million more to tear down the buildings at Times Beach, burn the contaminated soil, bury debris in specially designed landfills and convert the land into a park. The work is being paid for by the Syntex Corporation, under a court-sanctioned agreement with the Enviornmental Protection Agency that will not be affected by any reassessment of dioxin's danger, said Gary J. Pendergrass, who heads the Syntex cleanup program. Produced during chemical reactions that involve heat and chlorine compounds, dioxins comes in 75 different varieties, with one form thought to be the most dangerouus: 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo dioxin or TCDD. In the early 1980's, the compound's deadly reputation was based in large measure on its ability to cause cancer in laboratory animals, even when the animals were exposed to very small doses. Guinea pigs fed minute amounts died within weeks. Subsequent studies have shown trout and salmon may be even more sensitive. Studies of workers exposed to dioxin in chemical plants during routine operations, and as a result of explosions, showed conclusively that exposure to dioxin at levels of several hundred parts per billion could cause chloracne, a potentially disfiguring skin disease. Other effects were less certain, said scientists in and out of Government. For every study that found dioxin could raise a person's chance of developing cancer or some other disease, another study reported that there was no effect at all. At the center of the debate is an inexact science known as risk assessment. It uses animal studies and human health studies, when possible, combined with statistics and formal scientific assumptions and a great deal of expert opinion to develop an estimate of how much exposure to a chemical is likely to cause cancer and birth defects in people. The technique, which the experts agree is as much art as science, was widely employed by the Government in the 1970's and 1980's because there was almost no other scientifically acceptable means for determining a compound's hazards. But because every step in the process is open to interpretation, two scientists looking at the same data can come up with sharply differing conclusions. Scientists say better techniques are now available to more accurately reflect the toxic properties of chemicals, particularly those used by molecular biologists. More is known about how chemicals react with biological organisms, how they exert their toxic effects on cells and what the ultimate result is likely to be. Industrial groups argue that the Government's risk assessment work needs to be modernized because the old methods have produced outdated environmental standards that are costing them billions of dollars in unnecessary pollution control equipment. Vietnam veterans exposed to dioxin in the defoliant Agent Orange blame it for cancer, nervous system disorders, a host of other injuries, and for producing birth defects in their children. Legislation passed this year requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to pay disability benefits to soldiers who can prove they were exposed to Agent Orange and suffer from chloracne, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and a liver disease called porphyria cutanea tarda. A Death and Dioxin In lawsuit involving a death attributed to exposure to dioxin, a St. Louis jury last month awarded $1.5 million to the family of a truck driver who died in 1984 of soft-tissue sarcoma. The loading area where he worked had been sprayed with the same oil that contaminated Times Beach. In the late 1970's, dioxin contamination lead to the ban of a weed killer, 2,4,5-T, a component of Agent Orange, once used widely in American farming and forestry. The environmental agency said it caused miscarriages and birth defects. In the 1980's the paper industry came under criticism for producing dioxin when bleaching pulp, polluting rivers and streams. For the former residents of Times Beach, the new debate over dioxin has added to the hurt, anger and exasperation that many feel every day. \"You just don't know what to think,\" said Marilyn Leistner, the former Mayor of Times Beach who now works for the state at the site. \"If dioxin is less dangerous, that should be good news. The truth is, it's not. People have been hurt, their lives ruined by what happened in this area. One minute it's bad. The next it's good. It's a roller coaster that just won't stop.\" For Mrs. Leistner and the other 2,239 former residents of Times Beach, the introduction to dioxin came out of the blue in December 1982. Soil samples the Environmental Protection Agency collected weeks earlier contained dioxin at levels exceeding 100 parts for every billion parts of soil. The agency's samples had been taken as part of an investigation of dioxin contamination in the St. Louis region. The inquiry began after a hazardous waste trucking company sprayed roads and parking lots for dust control with waste oil containing dioxin in the early 1970's.", "snippet": "In a rare official reassessment, several top Federal health authorities are backing away from the position that the chemical compound dioxin is toxic enemy No. 1.
