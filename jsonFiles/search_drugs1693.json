The study, by the State Commission on the Quality of Care for the Mentally Disabled, found that hospitals in the state often require, through written agreement or tradition, that psychiatric institutions provide either a therapy aide or registered nurse during hospital stays for their residents. This rule, the study says, costs the state $1.2 million a year, or the equivalent of the annual salary of 93 therapy aides, as well as overtime costs and disruptions at the mental hospitals. Clarence Sundram, chairman of the commission, said that these workers simply ''baby sit'' for the mentally disabled during their hospital stays and are not allowed to provide any medical treatment.", "headline": {"main": "'BABY-SITTING' OF MENTALLY ILL IS TERMED COSTLY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "39", "word_count": 604, "_id": "4fd128a98eb7c8105d5efd0e", "snippet": "A new study says a ''baby-sitting'' requirement at many hospitals is costing the state more than $1 million a year and may be discouraging timely medical treatment for patients from New York State mental institutions.
