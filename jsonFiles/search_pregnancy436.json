Falling squarely into the much-ado-about-nothing category, Annie J. Howell and Lisa Robinson's debut feature hovers over Sarah (Anna Margaret Hollyman), a bland Los Angeles technophile who relates more willingly to wires and processors than to the fetus in her womb. Deciding that this is clearly the fault of her long-estranged mother (the marvelous Mary Beth Peil), currently residing off the grid in the Arizona desert, Sarah sets out for an uninvited reunion. Detours to a nightmarish baby shower, a Skype-obsessed father and a Vegas masseuse prove depressingly uninvigorating to both Sarah's maternal instincts and the film around her.", "headline": {"main": "Small, Beautifully Moving Parts", "kicker": "MOVIE REVIEW"}, "abstract": "Jeannette Catsoulis reviews movie Small, Beautifully Moving Parts, directed by Annie J Howell and Lisa Robinson and starring Anna Margaret Hollyman.
