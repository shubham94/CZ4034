Her action ought to signal Gore supporters everywhere to put on a burst of energy and not be intimidated by the triumphalist theater of the Bush campaign. Borrowing a page from Ronald Reagan's playbook, Governor Bush is trying to act as if he has this contest locked up. But in fact, this presidential election is up for grabs. With four days left to campaign, Vice President Gore is ahead, gaining or highly competitive in the swing states that will decide the outcome. The polls are deceptive at this point. Mr. Bush has maintained a one- to four-point lead nationwide for several weeks by pumping his margins in Texas and other states that are safely in his pocket. But the state-by-state outlook and the electoral-vote arithmetic are much better for Mr. Gore. He is ahead in Florida in some polls, the one megastate other than Texas that was supposed to be a sure thing for Mr. Bush.
