Why? No one likes it this way: not liberals, not conservatives.'' The sad fact is that they both like it this way. If they didn't, they would do something about it -- as have some other, more caring societies -- rather than continue to reap the (illusory) benefits of cheap labor. Ron Suskind, in his review of David K. Shipler's book, focuses on portraits of individuals that are supposed to make the working poor more real. Woven into this approach is also an account of small-scale governmental policies and charitable ameliorations of working poverty, along with descriptions of those actions of the poor themselves that serve either to improve or to worsen their lot. One can only assume this focus reflects that of the book Suskind reviews. But those countries that do not have, as the United States does, enormous and widening disparities of wealth deal with the reality of poverty by focusing on a few national policies that work. These countries (predominantly Scandinavian or European with strong social democratic political traditions) have national health insurance, state-provided pensions (which allow low-income workers more disposable income in the short run as well as a dignified retirement), a high and nationally uniform level of spending on education, enforced laws ensuring the ability of unions to organize and represent workers, and unemployment compensation that does not compel the unemployed to take inhumanly low-paying work.
