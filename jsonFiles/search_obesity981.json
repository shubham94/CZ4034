You probably have to have been around for seven decades to make a popular song feel as lived-in and understood as Ms. Clooney, who turns 70 tomorrow. Realistic but reassuring, expansively maternal, radiating wisdom, acceptance and good humor, Ms. Clooney is a rock, but an increasingly fragile one. If recent ill health and obesity have left her short of breath, she works her way around these difficulties with remarkable agility, aided by an excellent six-piece band under John Oddo's masterly direction. The songs chosen for an engagement that has the aura of a farewell lean toward the elegiac and include ''For All We Know,'' ''Thanks for the Memory'' and ''Our Love Is Here to Stay.''

Dinner is required for the early show; seating is at 6:30 P.M.", "snippet": "Here is a selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.    * ROSEMARY CLOONEY, Rainbow and Stars, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, 65th floor, (212) 632-5000.
