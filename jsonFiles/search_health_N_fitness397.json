Starting this December, however, a new Food and Drug Administration rule mandates that any new adult drug that could be used by children with the same disease must undergo pediatric study, and its manufacturers must list doses for children on the label. In addition, if an adult drug already on the market has the potential to help children with the same disease, or if it is widely used in children and the absence of labeling seems dangerous, the F.D.A. can require pediatric tests. The F.D.A. was, in part, shaped in response to high-profile problems involving children, including the severe birth defects caused by thalidomide, a sedative given to pregnant women in the late 1950's. But Dr. Dianne Murphy, associate director of the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, says that for a host of ethical, scientific and economic reasons, the agency has not mandated drug research on children, until now.", "headline": {"main": "A CONVERSATION WITH Dianne Murphy; Trying to End Guesswork In Dosing Children"}, "abstract": "Interview with Dr Dianne Murphy, who leads Food and Drug Administration efforts to test on children adult drugs prescribed for children; photo (M)", "print_page": "7", "word_count": 2209, "_id": "4fd20a728eb7c8105d777404", "snippet": "Many parents might be surprised to learn that most of the drugs prescribed for children, from allergy relievers to asthma inhalants and antidepressants, have never been formally tested on children.
