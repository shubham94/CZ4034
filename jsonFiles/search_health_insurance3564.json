Mr. Bush accused the vice president of using ''fuzzy numbers,'' but never refuted the basic charge. In fact, Mr. Gore's formula was on target, illustrating a stark choice between the two candidates' approaches on the tax issue. Mr. Bush likes to defend his proposals as lowering tax rates for everyone, not just those who seize the narrowly crafted incentives offered by Mr. Gore. He has a point. In order to take advantage of the Gore tax cuts, taxpayers would have to tap into credits or deductions for child care, health insurance, college tuition, care of disabled relatives and other needs. A working-class family without these expenses might get little or no tax relief.

The plan would apply to all new high schools built as part of the current five-year capital plan. The board directed Chancellor Harold O. Levy, above, to report back in 90 days on how a year-round schedule would affect the board's capital and annual budgets and its collective bargaining with the school system's unions. The two dissenting members, Jerry Cammarata and Irene H. Impellizzeri, said they could not support the proposal without more information about its financial impact. Edward Wyatt (NYT) WHITE PLAINS: MAINTENANCE STRIKE -- Maintenance workers at 532 apartment buildings in Westchester County have been on strike since Tuesday after contract negotiations collapsed. The Building and Realty Institute of Westchester and the Mid-Hudson Region, the group representing condominium, cooperative and rental buildings, said that less than a third of the workers had joined the strike. But Local 32E of the Service Employees International Union reported complete participation by its 3,000 workers. The union is seeking a raise of $25 a week for each of three years, more than the building group has proposed, and the two sides are far apart on health insurance. Talks are to resume today in White Plains. Lisa W. Foderaro (NYT) MANHATTAN: EMINENT DOMAIN CHALLENGED -- Private property owners have filed a lawsuit challenging New York's power of eminent domain, or the right to condemn and take private land for public use. A federal district judge in Manhattan barred the condemnation of three properties yesterday: an East Harlem cabinetmaking business; a row of newly renovated buildings in Port Chester, N.Y., that were to be acquired by municipal authorities for private parking lots; and a church in North Hempstead that had a building under construction. Laura Mansnerus (NYT) MANHATTAN: 14TH WEST NILE VICTIM -- A 37-year-old Staten Island man is the 14th person in New York City found to have been sickened by the West Nile virus this year. The man had symptoms indicating the virus, which is carried by mosquitoes, several weeks before he was hospitalized in late September, suggesting he was most likely first infected in August, city officials said. He was released from the hospital on Sunday and is at home in Bulls Head recovering, said officials, who did not release his name. Eric Lipton (NYT) NEW JERSEY MONTCLAIR: ROBBERY AT POST OFFICE -- Nearly $100,000 in cash and checks was taken from an armored truck at the main post office in Montclair after hours on Tuesday, postal officials said yesterday. Joseph Basile, the Montclair postmaster, said the robbery was under investigation. One employee said workers were on edge because this was the second robbery in a year and there were persistent memories of the 1995 shootings of four people at the nearby Montclair postal annex at Watchung Plaza. Acknowledging employees' concerns, Mr. Basile said that counselors would be available. Maria Newman (NYT) PARSIPPANY: HOSPITAL PENALTY DELAYED -- The federal government has delayed its cutoff of money to Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital. Last month, the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, complaining the hospital was short-staffed, told the State Department of Human Services that it would end reimbursements for Medicare, Medicaid and uninsured patients starting Oct. 13. But on Tuesday, the federal agency told the state that inspectors would visit again next Tuesday. The state has submitted a plan to hire 99 staff members and move 43 of its 615 patients, said Pam Ronan, a human services spokeswoman. Steve Strunsky (NYT) TRENTON: READING SCORES ADJUSTED -- State education officials said yesterday that they had lowered the passing grade on the state's writing test for fourth graders. As a result, some who previously failed the test will have their grades adjusted to show that they passed. The education commissioner, David C. Hespe, declined to say how many of the estimated 100,000 fourth graders who took the exam are now considered to have passed instead of failed. The scores have no effect on whether a student is promoted to fifth grade, but are used to evaluate writing ability. (AP) ATLANTIC CITY: SMOKE-FREE CASINO -- Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino has banned smoking in the casino's East Tower. Casino officials said the smoke-free East Tower casino, which has only slot machines, is the first completely enclosed gambling area in an Atlantic City casino where smoking is banned. Other casinos have smoke-free areas but most are adjacent to slot machines, blackjack tables or roulette wheels where smoking is allowed. (AP) CONNECTICUT -- HARTFORD: INQUIRY IN TODDLER'S DEATH -- Connecticut's Child Fatality Review Panel yesterday began investigating the death of a 3-year-old boy who had been under the state's legal supervision when he died in Florida last week. Jeanne Milstein, Connecticut's child advocate, said a panel would look into whether the state failed to adequately protect the boy, Alex Boucher, after allowing him to temporarily visit James and Jennifer Curtis, a Florida couple who hoped to adopt him. Mr. Curtis was charged with killing Alex last week, and the commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Children and Families, Kristine D. Regaglia, has admitted her agency had mistakenly sent Alex to the couple, and did not supervise the visit.
