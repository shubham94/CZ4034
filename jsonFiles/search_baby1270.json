By ELLIOTT STEIN Recently the director John Carpenter appeared on the David Letterman television show and presented a clip from his latest film, ''The Thing,'' consisting of special effects footage of an Alaskan husky which has been invaded by an alien life form from outer space. The creature was seen writhing and snarling, dripping with repulsive liquid and baring long claws with which it pulled off pieces of a roof until it was dispatched with a flamethrower. The studio audience was audibly entertained by the clip. Mr. Letterman then asked Mr. Carpenter: ''Would you send your 8-year-old child to see the movie?'' The director replied: ''I would evaluate my 8-yearold and then decide. If I was 8 years old I would certainly want to see it.''", "headline": {"main": "HAVE HORROR FILMS GONE TOO FAR?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2804, "_id": "4fd122e08eb7c8105d5e612d", "snippet": "--------------------------------------------------------------------  Elliott Stein writes regularly for Film Comment.
