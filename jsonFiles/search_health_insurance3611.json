I have absolutely no doubt that a good number of accident patients have received unnecessary protracted medical care by physicians and chiropractors. In addition, insurance carriers, when attempting to adjudicate or settle cases, have compounded this situation by often measuring the degree of permanent injury by the amount of medical treatment, which fosters prolonged treatment. Therefore, it is essential (especially in neck and low back patients) that all treatment be subject to review after four weeks. Declining of treatment should be reviewed, if requested, by unbiased specialists, who must be required to put their reasoning in writing.
