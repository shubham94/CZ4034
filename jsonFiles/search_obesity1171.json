For about half of those with hypertension, they say, restricting salt has little effect; for many of the others, the benefits are slim. And just as salt, or sodium, has been downgraded as a culprit in the genesis of high blood pressure, other dietary suspects are gaining ground: Recent studies suggest that for some people it is not too much salt, but too little calcium, that sets the stage for hypertension.", "snippet": "MANY people who have dutifully given up soy sauce, pickles and pretzels in an attempt to prevent high blood pressure by limiting salt may be sacrificing needlessly, a growing number of researchers now believe.

CULLEN, a systems program analyst, can remember lying in bed, eyes wide open, watching a stranger move about her room in the shadows. Transfixed with fear and unable to move or make a sound, she could only lie and wait silently for the figure to disappear, as it always did, and for control over her body to return. David Elving Schwartz, a Newark lawyer, recalls driving along the Garden State Parkway when, he says, he felt a wave of fatigue sweep over his body. Struggling to stay awake, he slapped himself, hard, in the face. Then, glancing over at a car beside him, Mr. Schwartz was embarrassed and hurt at seeing the occupants of the other car laughing at him.", "snippet": "JUDITH M.
