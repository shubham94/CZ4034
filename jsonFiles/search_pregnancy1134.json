The story of how RU-486 got approval is buried in 9,300 pages of documents released by the drug agency to the legal watchdog group Judicial Watch, which filed a Freedom of Information Act suit. These documents show that the Clinton administration -- which had been warned of the drug's potential hazards as far back as 1995 in a citizen petition filed by Americans United for Life -- pushed to get RU-486 approved before the 2000 election despite the lack of reliable data demonstrating its safety.", "headline": {"main": "Dangerous Medicine", "kicker": "Op-Ed Contributor"}, "abstract": "Op-Ed article by Donna J Harrison, obstetrician-gynecologist, contends FDA's announcement that it will strenghthen warning label for drug RU-486, known by brand name Mifeprex, is case of too little too late; notes three Americans have died after taking pill since it was approved in heavily politicized process by Congress and Clinton administration in Sept 2000; contends new announcement suggests that FDA still hasn't learned its lesson--that that this drug should be taken off pharmacy shelves; drawing (M)", "print_page": "27", "word_count": 1046, "_id": "4fd249818eb7c8105d7e6e4b", "snippet": "The Food and Drug Administration's announcement that it will strengthen the warning label for the drug RU-486 suggests it still hasn't learned its lesson.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/19/opinion/19harrison.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2004/11/18/nyregion/20041119_oped_75.gif", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2004/11/18/nyregion/20041119_oped_75.gif"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55, "height": 55}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CLINTON, BILL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CONGRESS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "JUDICIAL WATCH"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION OF AMERICA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MIFEPRISTONE (DRUG)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MIFEPREX (RU-486) (DRUG)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ABORTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LABELING AND LABELS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CONSUMER PROTECTION"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Donna", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "Harrison", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By Donna J.
