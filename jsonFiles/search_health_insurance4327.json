He helped start the organization that became the United Way in Rochester. One year he even paid to remove the tonsils of every child in town. After Eastman died in 1932, his company remained a model of civic sensibility. It resisted the temptation to use its size to negotiate for cheaper medical care for its Rochester employees, a tactic that would mean higher prices for individuals who did not work for Kodak and most small businesses and might push some companies to eliminate health benefits entirely. Many health-care experts have praised the company for an all-for-one and one-for-all spirit that has meant, among other things, that only about 7 percent of area residents do not have health insurance, compared with 15 percent nationally.
