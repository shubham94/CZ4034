Clark is a dramatic step in a long effort that has a much larger goal: development of a heart that is reliable, permanent and ''forgettable,'' the term the heart's chief designer, Dr. Robert K. Jarvik, uses to define his objective. Dr. Clark, a 61-year-old retired dentist who received the heart Thursday at the University of Utah Medical Center in Salt Lake City, will never be able to forget that the pulse of his life's blood is conveyed into his body through pneumatic tubes from an external power supply carried in a large cart. But the research team that developed today's Jarvik-7 heart are already at work on successors that the team hopes will run on a portable battery pack that will let their wearers forget about them, at least for a time, and to be mobile and to live more nearly normal lives. The research program has made the University of Utah the world's leader in development of artificial devices to replace the human heart, but that leadership has taken many years to achieve. Pioneer Came From Netherlands The long-term leader of the effort is Dr. Willem J. Kolff, a Dutch-born physician who developed the first effective artificial kidney machine in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands in World War II.", "snippet": "The artificial heart now beating in the chest of Dr. Barney B.

Hardly an unusual meal for an American eating out. Nor is its aftermath - heartburn - unusual. For nearly everything about that meal except the roll and the potato, before they were dressed with fat in the form of butter, can trigger heartburn in susceptible people.
