In New York, as across the country, advocates for battered women are urging a re-evaluation of the harsh sentences usually given women who kill or assault the people who have abused them. A1. NEW YORK CITY EMPIRE GRANTED RATE INCREASE The Cuomo administration granted a large rate increase to Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the state's largest health insurer, presenting 1.4 million New Yorkers -- many of whom cannot get coverage from commercial insurers -- with increases in premiums that will average 25.5 percent. The increases are to take effect immediately, though hope of a state-financed bailout remains. A1. FEUD EXPLODES AT CITY HALL A long simmering but little noted feud between two of the Dinkins administration's top officials -- First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel and Barbara J. Sabol, who heads the city's vast social services bureaucracy -- has worsened. Their relationship has become so bitter that it has undermined New York City's ability to forge strategies on social issues, advocates for the poor, union leaders and some city officials say. A1. FASTER ACTION ON POLICE COMPLAINTS Raymond W. Kelly, the New York City Police Commissioner, announced that when civil lawsuits include charges of excessive force, false arrest, assault or other misconduct against the police, the Internal Affairs Bureau would immediately investigate. B3. HOUSING PROJECT TERRORIZED BY CRIMES A series of crimes against women in a Brooklyn housing project have left residents fearful even to take out the garbage. The police say that at least 11 women and girls in two buildings at the Sumner project in Bedford-Stuyvesant have been attacked by one to three men. Six women were raped and sodomized, including three who were also robbed. B3. REGION HARSH QUESTIONS AFTER ABDUCTION Almost a year before 9-year-old Katie Beers disappeared from the care of a family friend at a Long Island video arcade, her mother was warned by an official of the local Big Brothers organization that the friend's behavior sounded suspicious. And amid other reports of the man's unfitness as a baby sitter, many of the divisions haunting the Beers family came to light. B5. PRIVATE AID BUFFERS STORM DAMAGE Almost three weeks after a ferocious rainstorm swept into New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, Federal loans and grants have begun to trickle out to residents whose homes and property were damaged. But the largest source of help so far has been private charity. B5.
