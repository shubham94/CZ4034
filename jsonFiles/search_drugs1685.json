The Governor also reiterated that there would be no amnesty for the rebellious inmates. The inmates seized 19 guards Saturday night in a dispute that began over recreational time.

The drug is already used in more than 80 countries and is enthusiastically endorsed by population control groups because a single injection prevents ovulation and conception for at least three months. Dr. Elizabeth B. Connell, professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, told the board today that she had polled 20 experts and found that they ranked Depo-Provera ahead of all other contraceptives, including the pill, intrauterine devices, the condom and diaphragm. At a news conference held earlier, she said that Depo-Provera ''comes very very close to the ideal'' contraceptive. The drug's chief virtues, according to its adherents, are that it is highly effective, remains effective even if the user is a few weeks late in obtaining a repeat injection, and requires less motivation than the pill, which must be taken daily, or barrier contraceptives, which must be applied at the time of intercourse. The drug can be administered by any person who normally gives injections in a health care system.", "headline": {"main": "INJECTED CONTRACEPTIVE: HAZARD OR BOON?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1448, "_id": "4fd12bcf8eb7c8105d5f57b5", "snippet": "A rare public board of inquiry opened a five-day hearing today to evaluate whether the drug Depo-Provera is an almost ideal contraceptive for women - or a potential cause of cancer, birth defects and other disease.

The national health care system is a part of a culture, a history, a political and economic order. It embodies our view of a basic social commitment to the care of the sick, the weak and the helpless. It speaks to issues of justice and equity and human rights. It expresses our belief in the power of science and our attitude toward physicians.
