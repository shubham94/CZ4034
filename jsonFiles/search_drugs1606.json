It was a highly unusual move for a company that for years towered well above its competitors. But the meaning was clear: After years of profits so fat that they immunized the $30 billion American pharmaceutical industry against economic downturns, the big drug companies have suddenly found themselves mired in the same sort of troubles that have plagued less-glamorous industries for years. Spiraling imports, legislative changes and new competition at home and abroad have struck hard. And with new blockbuster products harder and harder to come by, America's supremacy as the world's premier maker and seller of prescription drugs could be in jeopardy. ''The pressure is on us, if we're going to survive at the growth rates we had in the past,'' said John J.

To illustrate the ''heart'' of the I.R.S.: Virtually any payment you have made to someone who has diagnosed, treated, or prevented an illness, including mental illness, is deductible, regardless of whether the preson who provided the service was a physician, chiropractor or Christian Science practitioner. You can also deduct the cost of surgery and of procedures ranging from face lifts and hair transplants to electrolysis.
