Starting that day in 1984, and until May 1986, I ate Ecstasy, once or sometimes twice a month. During that same time I realized that the plan I'd made for my life (I was 20 years old) was useless.

And I still wonder what the drug had to do with that. Maybe nothing. (How can a drug do anything for you? Generally I hate drugs. I don't even take Advil.) It's impossible to say.
