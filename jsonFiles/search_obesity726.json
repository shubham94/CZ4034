His attempt to demonstrate the link between these two matters, using himself as an experimental subject, represents an entertaining, and occasionally horrifying, statement of the obvious. After all, even the McDonald's corporation, while defending itself in a lawsuit filed by two overweight teenagers, submitted briefs citing the well-known health risks of its highly processed, high-fat foods. McDonald's' victory in the case was followed by the passage in Congress of a bill shielding the industry from future liability. Like suits against tobacco companies, such cases -- and the larger issue of the relationship between legal consumables and public health -- turn on the question of responsibility.
