Making his way down a sweltering hallway, he passes countless children, their faces marred since birth, with raw, gaping holes where their lips and noses should be. The children stare at Munger -- his red beard and pale skin are oddities here -- but he does not stare back. Though they may never have seen a face like his, he has seen hundreds of faces like theirs. The sight has lost its power to shock, but not to sadden, so he keeps his gaze straight ahead and walks on. A hand-lettered sign taped to a rickety partition identifies his corner of one room:Genetics.Inside a makeshift cubicle sits a woman, Editha Bensi, her eyes clamped tight and her malformed mouth quivering while her blood flows out of a needle in her arm and into a vial. Next it is her children's turn. Nurses restrain Matthias, 5, and Maria Ana, 2, then prick their fingers, squeezing out 10 crimson drops onto an absorbent white card. Editha's vial, still warm to the touch, is labeled and placed in a box with dozens of others. The children's cards, the spots not yet dry, are clipped to a piece of twine that hangs along one wall.
