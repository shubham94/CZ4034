Start with the fact that $2.5 trillion of the projected surplus comes from Social Security and another $500 billion or so comes from Medicare. Both pots of money are essentially off limits. Congress appears committed to using the extra money from these programs to pay down the federal debt -- a use that does not affect the solvency of either program but does improve the overall health of the future economy.
