Candidates for Governor Debate\u00a0| With a little more than five weeks before the June primary, two Republicans vying to lead California debated on Sunday night. Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay who is considered the front-runner in the race, and Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner, each sought to portray themselves as the more conservative of the two. Both candidates called for the repeal of the new federal health care law and the suspension of the state's landmark global warming law. Ms. Whitman is now almost even in polls with Jerry Brown, the Democrats' major candidate, who also is the state's former governor. Mr. Poizner, who wore a blazer with no tie, tried to paint Ms. Whitman, a billionaire who has poured her own money into the race, as out of touch with ordinary people. Mr. Poizner, a former Silicon Valley entrepreneur, has also spent much of his own money on his campaign.
