Fat might be good for us now, some people say, and carbohydrates bad. Not so long ago, the opposite was true. Probably it will be again. These things tend to work the way pendulums do. Diet fads and government guidelines over the last quarter-century have not helped to produce a slimmer America. We are a fatter country now, on average, than we were in the 1970's. What diet fads have given us are short-term losses and long-term gains because few if any of them emphasize a key fact: If you consume more calories than you expend, you will gain weight. And despite what the opposing sides in this long-running debate assert, it doesn't make much difference where the calories come from. A successful dieter needs to burn them.", "snippet": "EVERY 10 years or so, it seems, the country's anxiety over dieting builds to a peak and a realization hits home: Whatever weight-loss program has so recently captivated us is wrong.
