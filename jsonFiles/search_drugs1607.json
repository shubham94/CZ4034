By Pascal James Imperato and Greg Mitchell. 286 pp. New York: Viking. $15.95. DAY-TO-DAY living on the Wild West frontier could became an occupational hazard when bullets started flying. ''He died of livin','' was old Doc Adams's disingenuous diagnosis of the cause of a cowboy's demise on television's ''Gunsmoke'' series when the man failed to dodge a stray bullet. In our day, other kinds of bullets are flying, insidious and invisible, hitting us like a silent hail. These are the atoms and molecules of chemicals and packets of radiation in our air and water, and even in the food we eat. The analogy to bullets is not far-fetched. Joshua Lederberg, the Nobel Prize-winning geneticist and president of Rockefeller University, thinks that a single molecule of a hazardous substance, such as nitrogen mustard, for instance, is sufficient to turn a cell cancerous.
