The studies were of women who had been exposed to relatively high levels of the chemicals, known technically as polychlorinated biphenyls, while working at the General Electric Company's plants upstate at Fort Edwards and Hudson Falls. Both plants stopped using PCB's in manufacturing electrical equipment in 1976, when Congress banned production of the chemical as a toxic hazard. ''The results do not prove that PCB's have no effect on human health in any circumstance,'' the department said, noting that the studies were limited to birth weight. Studies of the death rate and the cancer rate of workers at the two plants are under way, with results expected next year, the department said.", "snippet": "Two studies by the State Health Department have found no evidence that the direct exposure of pregnant women to PCB's results in lower birth weights.
