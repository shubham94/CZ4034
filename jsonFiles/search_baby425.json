This New York Musical Theater Festival hit is a satirical musical about several artists racing to finish a musical in three weeks. Apparently, they got it done (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Opens Monday. Dead pets, severed limbs, black Irish humor -- Martin McDonagh (''The Pillowman'') is up to his old tricks in this devilish comedy about terrorism and torture (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. 'DEFIANCE' Opens Tuesday.

Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON' Opens Wednesday.

Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'BERNARDA ALBA' Opens March 6.

'GREY GARDENS' Opens March 7. Maybe the biggest question mark of the musical season, this intriguing show is an adaptation of the cult documentary about the eccentric relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (2:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' Opens March 5. The resourceful Pearl Theater tries to provide an answer to this problem play (2:30). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. 'MEASURE FOR PLEASURE' Opens March 8. A new play by David Grimm (''Kit Marlowe'') that is part Restoration comedy, part modern sex comedy (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. 'THE MUSIC TEACHER, A PLAY/OPERA' Opens March 6. This artistic hybrid by Wallace Shawn and his brother, Allen, is a drama about the making of an opera that features -- are you still following? -- operatic flashbacks (1:50). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. 'RING OF FIRE' Opens March 12. Johnny Cash hits form the backbone of this musical about three couples. So far, it's received surprisingly good buzz. Richard Maltby Jr. directs (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'SIDD' Opens March 15. Herman Hesse's novel ''Siddhartha,'' the musical version (2:15). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'ACTS OF MERCY: PASSION-PLAY' If there is a coherent story to Michael John Garc\u00e9s' ''Acts of Mercy: passion-play,'' it is resolutely kept from the audience. As the efforts of two brothers to reconcile with a dying father progress, it seems possible that viewers are meant to discern the consequences of family trauma from punchy monosyllabic combat and repeated expletives, but their efforts to connect are continually frustrated (2:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, west of Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Honor Moore) * 'ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL' This Theater for a New Audience production inspires a quiet prayer of thanks to the theater gods. Here is that rare Shakespeare production in which there is nary an incompetent, misjudged or ineffective performance in a significant role. Darko Tresnjak and his cast find a way to make the play's troubled romance, between the adoring Helena and the disdaining Bertram, psychologically credible and even touching (2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'CLEAN ALTERNATIVES' Brian Dykstra's improbable comedy details the good fight fought by a businesswoman turned environmental activist taking on a toxin-spreading megacorporation. The play also depicts the moral transformation of a rapacious lawyer into a love-smitten puppy dog. Call it a fairy tale for our time (2:00). 59E59 Theaters , 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, the play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE' Satire sans teeth by Charles Grodin about internecine warfare within a Fifth Avenue co-op board. Directed by Chris Smith, the show has the embarrassed air of someone who has just been served a choice steak and misplaced his dentures (1:30). Primary Stages, at 59E59, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'THE SEVEN' The wild ride of luckless ol' Oedipus -- accidentally offing Dad, marrying Mom, being dissed by the kids -- gets pimped to the nines in this frisky and funny new riff on the classic story. Written by Will Power and directed by Jo Bonney, the show is a freewheeling adaptation of one of the more static, less revered Greek tragedies, Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'': a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'DECEMBER FOOLS' Sherman Yellen takes a stab at the letters-in-a-drawer play (old letters are discovered, and lives are changed), and things get off to a promising start: a New York matron's disgruntled daughter finds some of Mom's old screeds and turns them into weapons. But the play is too long, and some dandy comedy is undercut by some tired melodrama (2:15). Abington Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. ( Genzlinger) 'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing Saturday. (Zinoman) 'JUMP/CUT' Neena Beber's play about an aspiring filmmaker's effort to document his best friend's illness limns despair while leaving the audience exhilarated -- by the fierce beauty of Ms. Beber's writing, and by a captivating performance by Luke Kirby as the brilliant, charismatic, darkly funny manic-depressive whose inescapable fate is the central mystery of the work (2:10). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton; closing Sunday. (212) 239-6200. (Miriam Horn) * 'LENNY BRUCE IN HIS OWN WORDS' Jason Fisher does an impressive facsimile of this legendary comic in a nostalgic greatest-hits collection of his stand-up routines (1:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'LENNY & LOU' This black comedy by Ian Cohen about two brothers and their foul-mouthed, demented mother has the right ingredients for shock theater: four-letter words, sex talk, sex acts. But it somehow doesn't shock (2:15). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday.(Genzlinger) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the archmanipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closing Sunday. (Brantley) 'PARADISE' A mostly articulate drama by David Foley about an inarticulate young man who may have found Mr. Right or the tipping point that leads him into madness (1:30). Access Theater, 380 Broadway, north of White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. ( Zinoman) 'REAL BLACK MEN DON'T SIT CROSS-LEGGED ON THE FLOOR' The poet and playwright Malik's series of quick, interwoven scenes tracing the lives of African-American men in America, mainly in the last half century, can pack an emotional punch, but it works better as a showcase for some outstanding performances by its eight-member cast than it does as a theater piece (2:00). New Federal Theater, Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Andrea Stevens) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983; closing Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'BATTLE IN HEAVEN' (No rating, 94 minutes, in Spanish) An alternatingly mesmerizing and off-putting story about sex, class, God, soccer, an ugly man, a beautiful woman, a dead baby, the dirt below them and the wide sky above. The talented Mexican director Carlos Reygadas (''Jap\u00f3n'') strives to say something about his country, to tap into the spiritual and material desperation of its people, but doesn't seem especially committed to his material. (Manohla Dargis) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden) * 'CACH\u00c9 (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens) 'DESERT WIND' (No rating, 80 minutes, in French) In March 2004, the Swiss documentary maker Fran\u00e7ois Kohler took 13 men -- Canadian, French, Swiss and Belgian -- on a two-week trek in the Tunisian Sahara. The group was accompanied by a Swiss psychotherapist, as well as by a team of Tunisian guides with pack camels. The purpose of the trip: to stage a kind of men's encounter group in the desert, encouraging the participants to break away from received notions of masculinity and to talk about their desires, anxieties and deepest fears. Though it generates its share of unintentional giggles, ''Desert Wind'' does manage to take us to a seldom-visited place: the hidden corners of the straight male mind. (Stevens) 'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee) 'FIREWALL' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A thrill-challenged thriller starring Harrison Ford and directed by Richard Loncraine that manages to entertain mildly only because it traffics in all the familiar action-movie clich\u00e9s, giving filmgoers ample opportunity to test their action-movie I.Q.'s. (Dargis) 'FREEDOMLAND' (R, 113 minutes) This inept, lethally dull drama directed by Joe Roth and written by Richard Price, from his novel, involves a white child who may have gone missing in a New Jersey public housing complex, where the residents are all black. A loud Samuel L. Jackson and a miscast Julianne Moore star. (Dargis) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) * 'LOVE' (No rating, 93 minutes) Cool, mysterious and defiantly foreign, ''Love'' plays out on the immigrant fringes of an indifferent New York City. A Yugoslavian hit man, his German ex-wife and her cop boyfriend form a love triangle that propels a cosmopolitan cast into a violent game of cat and mouse. In these bleak, isolated neighborhoods, exquisitely shot by the Serbian cinematographer Vladimir Subotic, love and politics are inseparable and the gleam of Manhattan is a million miles away. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) 'PINK PANTHER' (PG, 92 minutes) Steve Martin steps into the shoes of Peter Sellers in this intermittently witty revival of a vintage comedy franchise. Though finely honed, Mr. Martin's portrayal of the idiotic French police inspector Jacques Clouseau can't match Sellers's viscerally funny one. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the movie rise above its indie road-picture clich\u00e9s. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned \u00fcber-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'A YEAR WITHOUT LOVE' (No rating, 95 minutes, in Spanish) Anah\u00ed Berneri's debut film recounts in uncomfortable close-up the day-to-day activities of a youngish gay writer from Buenos Aires afflicted with AIDS, who becomes involved in S-and-M. Based on the diaries of the real Pablo Per\u00e9z (he is also co-writer of the script), the film reveals rare insight into the endurance and treatment of illness, but is never fully arresting. (Laura Kern) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through March 13) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films runs five weeks this year. This weekend's films include Paul Rosdy's \"New World\" (2005), about what was once the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Karen Kramer's \"Ballad of Greenwich Village\" (2005), an affectionate profile of a neighborhood. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10.

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

(Laura Sinagra) BELLE & SEBASTIAN, THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS (Thursday) The deceptively gentle Scottish rock of Belle and Sebastian continues to find the exquisite balance between loll and lash. The New Pornographers are a revved-up Vancouver outfit whose smart constructions and tight power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension, until Neko Case's voice cuts through like a triumphant skywriter. 8:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $30 (sold out).

(Sinagra) GEORGE CLINTON & THE P-FUNK ALLSTARS (Tuesday) George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any Puritan reflexes. The band is large enough to be a party all on its own, with ranks of guitarists, singers, horn players and keyboardists to pump out songs that encompass decades of American musical history. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, $37.50; $42 at the door.

(Sinagra) DONALD FAGEN (Wednesday) Steely Dan's jaded-jazz rocker Donald Fagen tours in support of his first solo record since 1993, ''Morph the Cat'' (Reprise), on which, among other things, he focuses his recognizable leer on a hot airport security babe. 8 p.m., State Theater, 15 Livingston Avenue, New Brunswick, N.J., (732) 246-7469; $45 to $65. (Sinagra) FLOOK, KARAN CASEY BAND (Tonight) This Irish music bill begins with the traditional Celtic stylings of Flook, a band featuring flute, bodhran, accordion, guitar and bouzouki.

(Sinagra) HOWE GELB (Tomorrow) Howe Gelb, the songwriter at the core of Giant Sand, applies his scratchy voice to songs that can sound quiet and offhand or go lurching and twanging toward chaos. 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $12 . (Pareles) JOHN HAMMOND (Thursday) The rural blues tradition of polyrhythmic fingerpicking and casually revealing vocals is being upheld by revivalists like John Hammond, who has been playing country blues since the 1960's . He's a virtuoso whose songs, mostly classic blues, are feats of down-home intricacy. 8 p.m., Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 601-1000; $18 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles) SARAH HARMER (Wednesday) In the tradition of emotionally astute Canadian singer-songwriters, Sarah Harmer applies her sharp voice to bluegrass-tinged pop and wistful folk. 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, SoHo, (212) 941-8100; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sinagra) HOWLIN' FOR HUBERT (Tomorrow) The blues guitarist Hubert Sumlin's electric guitar style, evidenced on Howlin' Wolf classics like ''Killing Floor,'' influenced pretty much every classic rock heavyweight from Clapton to Zappa. Here he plays with the New York Dolls frontman David Johansen and the former Band drummer Levon Helm. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $30. (Sinagra) BILLY JOEL (Tomorrow, Monday, and Thursday) Last year, the iconic piano man released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real, if prickly, confidence and false bravado in both his playing and his delivery that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 to $89.50. (Sinagra) TED LEO & THE PHARMACISTS (Thursday) The Irish-American indie rocker Ted Leo plays soulful punk, nearly popping a neck vein for political justice. But his melodic sensibility and sudden falsetto also recall the melodic 1970's arena-rock of bands like Thin Lizzy. 8:30 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Columbia Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007; $15 (sold out).

(Sinagra) VUSI MAHLASELA (Thursday) Vusi Mahlasela was one of the most important songwriters of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, not just for his political courage but also for his sterling voice and for three-chord rockers that make earnest sentiments bounce. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Pareles) PAPOOSE, DJ PREMIER, SADAT X (Tonight) The Brooklyn rapper Papoose, a traditionally minded lyricist and keeper of the battle rhyme flame, has been doing the mixtape thing for a while now, but has been getting more attention lately. He is joined here by the New York rap stalwarts DJ Premiere and Sadat X. 9, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra) ARIEL PINK (Tonight) With a mind like a radio antenna, this California home-recording maven has made hundreds of bedroom-rock creations melding snippets of half-remembered strains into an often charming clamor. On this tour, he's using local bands in each city as his backup crew. Here it will be the noise-rock band Excepter. 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra) RAKIM, SAIGON (Monday) One of hip-hop's most commanding MC's, Rakim did his best work with DJ Eric B. in the late 1980's and early 90's, but his cool, confident flow is still one to beat. The socially conscientious rapper Saigon has gotten a push by playing himself on the television show ''Entourage.'' 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Sinagra) PONCHO SANCHEZ (Thursday through March 5) The conga player Poncho Sanchez plays a funky brand of salsa. 8 p.m., and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; $20 at the bar, $35 at tables. (Sinagra) STEVE RILEY AND THE MAMOU PLAYBOYS (Tonight) The accordionist Steve Riley leads one of the best bands from the Louisiana bayous. It reaches back to some of the oldest Cajun tunes while adding its own to the repertory, in arrangements that find gleaming new combinations of fiddle, triangle and guitar. The songs, with bayou stubbornness, are in Cajun French. 7:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212) 239-6200; $20. (Pareles) RJD2, ACEYALONE, BUSDRIVER (Sunday) Representing an offshoot of the crate-digging DJ tradition exemplified in the 1990's by the likes of DJ Shadow, RJD2 takes a cinematic approach. He has produced the soulful, dramatic ''Magnificent City'' (Project Blowed/Decon) for the rapper Aceyalone, who applies his sonorous voice to, among other things, the subject of greed. 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra) SPANISH HARLEM ORCHESTRA (Tonight through Sunday) Anyone who's heard a salsa band in New York City has probably seen some of the members of the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, which recaptures the golden age of 1970's salsa. This full-length club engagement should give these virtuosos a chance to dig deep into the music. 8 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; $20 at the bar, $30 at tables.

(Sinagra) THE STARTING LINE (Tomorrow) This Pennsylvania emo band's 2002 debut was called ''Say It Like You Mean It,'' and the vocalist Kenny Vasoli does, be his sentiments vacuous, boilerplate or downright skeevy. 6:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $20 (sold out). (Sinagra) THE STROKES (Wednesday) Six years ago, with its exaggerated Tom Petty jitters and rich hipster slumming, this band convinced fatigued late-1990's clubbers that rock was back. Lately the members are having trouble convincing anyone of anything, but their best songs still make for a fun show. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, (212) 485-1534; $35 in advance, $37 at the door. (Sinagra) TEST ICICLES (Wednesday and Thursday) This noisy British band plays a more metallic and sometimes happily melodic version of garage rock. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. Thursday at 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door.

(Sinagra) THE YEAH YEAH YEAH'S (Tonight and tomorrow night) The fashion-forward singer Karen O and her post-punk Yeah Yeah Yeahs' new material moves further away from the precision noise-rock of their past and spotlights more singing than forceful declaration. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20 (sold out). (Sinagra) ZAGNUT CIRKUS ORKESTAR (Tuesday) The accordionist Matthew Fass leads this six-piece Balkan brass band in music combining Greek, Turkish, Middle Eastern and Roma styles, as well as jazz. 9 p.m., Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; $8 suggested donation.

(Stephen Holden) BABY JANE DEXTER (Tomorrow) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; cover, $20, with a $15 minimum. (Holden) UTE LEMPER (Tonight and tomorrow night) This cabaret diva, who sings a mostly pan-European, heavily Germanic program reminds us that cabaret can be dangerous (but not hazardous to her health) when infused with politics. 8:45 and 10:45, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $85.

(Chinen) * CACHAO (Tuesday and Wednesday) In the 1940's, Israel Lopez, known as Cachao, helped define modern Cuban music, especially with respect to the bass; now in his 80's, he has wisdom to match his panache, as he'll demonstrate here with a 10-piece band. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $45 at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Amato Opera's reputation is that it conveys the spirit of, and a love for, Italian opera, though the full impact is impossible to achieve in a 102-seat theater with a cast that changes at every performance. And against the odds, all the principals at a recent performance of ''Aida'' managed to make it through to the end, demonstrating a true love of the piece if not always of the pitch. It's a unique experience. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) 'DARKLING' (Sunday through Tuesday, and Thursday) American Opera Projects' latest venture is a three-week run of this multimedia opera, which brings together extremely diverse composers -- Lee Hoiby and Stefan Weisman -- and performers, from singers to the alternative Flux Quartet. The subject: the Holocaust. Tuesday is opening night. Sunday afternoon at 3; Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights at 8; East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; $30 to $45.(Midgette) 'LA FORZA DEL DESTINO' (Tonight and Tuesday) It's tempting to say that ''Forza'' has the most numbingly ludicrous libretto of any Verdi opera, but with such stiff competition, who can truly say? Giancarlo del Monaco's drab staging, first seen in 1996 and hidden away in storage since then, offers little help, but the Met does have a vocally solid cast, with Deborah Voigt, Salvatore Licitra and Mark Delavan. Gianandrea Noseda conducts. Tonight at 8, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175.(Allan Kozinn) 'LAKM\u00c9' (Sunday) Delibes's ''Lakm\u00e9'' is best known for the coloratura soprano tour-de-force aria ''The Bell Song'' and an utterly dreamy duet for soprano and mezzo-soprano. But these days audiences do not often get to hear this once-popular opera complete. So it's good news for opera buffs that Eve Queler, a tireless champion of neglected works, will conduct a concert performance with the Opera Orchestra of New York. Eglise Guti\u00e9rrez, a young Cuban-born soprano whose career is taking off, sings the title role, with a cast that includes a young Armenian tenor, Yeghishe Manucharyan, and the veteran bass James Morris. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $125. (Anthony Tommasini) 'ROM\u00c9O ET JULIETTE' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The big news from the Met's new production of this Gounod opera is the French coloratura soprano Natalie Dessay. Singing with uncanny agility and lyrical elegance, she touchingly embodies the tragically impulsive young Juliette. The tenor Ram\u00f3n Vargas, though a stiff actor, delivers a vocally impassioned Rom\u00e9o. Guy Joosten's production evokes the look of Renaissance Italy, though with surreal touches and too much heavy-handed imagery of eternal love amid the starry cosmos. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 remaining tickets tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini) 'SAMSON ET DALILA' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The Met's color-coded production of this Saint-Sa\u00ebns opera, by Elijah Moshinsky, takes on Olga Borodina as Dalila. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Thursday. (Bernard Holland) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Monday) Angela Gheorghiu continues her star turn in the title role. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out. (Holland) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) A weekly presenter of chamber music concerts, this floating concert hall also offers great views of Lower Manhattan. Unfortunately, the roster of regular players seems to have shrunk of late. This weekend, the barge's executive director, Mark Peskanov, has again programmed himself and his colleagues as performers. This weekend, Mr. Peskanov and company play music by Mozart, Schubert, Shostakovich and Beethoven. Thursday, Allison Eldredge (cello) and Max Levinson (piano) perform Beethoven, Bartok and others. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35. (Jeremy Eichler) ALFRED BRENDEL (Monday) As this eminent Austrian pianist settles into his golden years, he seems quite content to focus on the Viennese Classical works that have been the core of his repertory. For his Carnegie recital he offers Schubert's lengthy and reflective late Sonata in G (D. 894), and Mozart's brooding Fantasy in C minor and melancholic Rondo in A minor. But if this sounds rather pensive, fear not: he will bracket these works with performances of two high-spirited and witty Haydn sonatas. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $97. (Tommasini) BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) The news is Michael Christie, the new music director of an orchestra that established a tradition of hot young music directors with Robert Spano. Mr. Christie gets raves from people who have encountered him; his opening concert includes the world premiere of a new ''Fanfare'' written for the event by John Corigliano, and Orff's ''Carmina Burana,'' as well as works by Stravinsky and Philip Glass. 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $60. (Midgette) CAPPELLA ANDREA BARCA (Tomorrow) Like so many of his piano-playing colleagues, Andras Schiff takes up conducting as well in this all-Mozart program. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $97. (Holland) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Tonight and Sunday) The acclaimed pianist Angela Hewitt is known above all for Bach and French music; her programs with the Chamber Music Society this weekend focus on the French, with pieces ranging from a Ravel trio to the Franck quintet. She also joins the young German cellist Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott for the Debussy cello sonata. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49 (Midgette). JERUSALEM CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Wednesday and Thursday) Chamber music festivals, increasingly, are ensembles that come together for an intense couple of weeks and then go on the road. The pianist Elena Bashkirova founded this one in 1998, and it's been an occasional guest at Carnegie Hall, where this year its programs include Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony and a healthy admixture of Mozart. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35 to $40. (Midgette) I MUSICI (Sunday) This venerable Italian orchestra offers an all-Mozart program that includes the ''Serenata Notturna,'' the Piano Concerto No. 14 in E flat with Stephen Hough, the Divertimento in D (K. 136) and ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.'' 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $56. (Kozinn) LOCRIAN CHAMBER PLAYERS (Tonight) This ensemble's rule is that it performs only works written in the last decade. Included this time are Lukas Foss's String Quartet No. 5 and ''For Toru,'' as well as works by Michael Daugherty, David Shohl and David Macdonald. 8, Riverside Church, 10th-floor performance space, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (718) 458-4864; free.

(Holland) NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY (Sunday) Paul Haas conducts ''The Other Rainbow'' by Roger Zare and Stravinsky's challenging ''Rite of Spring.'' 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $7 to $55. (Holland) PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) For all reports, Christoph Eschenbach, now in his third season as music director, has had a shaky relationship with the Philadelphia players. Still, he is a comprehensive musician, and the orchestra is capable of doing great work with him. Longtime fans of this illustrious orchestra should be curious to hear this program, with the New York premiere of Esa-Pekka Salonen's ''Insomnia'' and Beethoven's ''Pastoral'' Symphony. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $99. (Tommasini) * POMERIUM (Sunday) Alexander Blachly's early-music choir is a mainstay of the Music Before 1800 series, and of early-music life in New York generally. Its program this time centers on Ockeghem, and features his Missa ''L'Homme Arm\u00e9,'' as well as works by Dufay, Binchois and Busnois. 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266; $25 and $40; $20 and $35 for students and 62+. (Kozinn) DAVID ROBERTSON YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERT (Tomorrow) In addition to presenting concerts, Carnegie Hall also runs numerous professional training workshops every year. This week, the conductor David Robertson and his colleagues have been working intensively with young musicians from around the country to prepare them in a program of challenging scores by Messiaen (''Sept Ha\u00efka\u00ef'' and ''Oiseaux Exotiques'') and Var\u00e8se (''D\u00e9serts''). Under Mr. Robertson's baton, the workshop participants will show what they've learned. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $15. (Eichler) * JORDI SAVALL (Thursday) If you aren't convinced of the persuasive power of the viola da gamba, then you probably haven't heard Jordi Savall play it. There will be several opportunities this season, starting with this recital of works by Sainte-Colombe, Marais, Bach, Hume, Ferrabosco and others. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38. (Kozinn) TAKACS QUARTET (Tonight) Bartok has long been a specialty of this quartet, which offers the Bartok Second as the centerpiece of a program that opens with Schubert's Quartet in A minor (D. 804) and closes with Mozart's Quintet in C (K. 515), with James Dunham joining to play the extra viola part. 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $44 and $52. (Kozinn) LES VIOLONS DU ROY (Sunday) This spirited chamber orchestra is based in Quebec City and led by the able Canadian conductor Bernard Labadie. And while the group plays on modern instruments, its repertory often leans toward the Baroque. Here, it will perform Jean-Fery Rebel's ''\u00c9l\u00e9mens,'' a suite from Rameau's ''Dardanus'' and arias by Rameau and Gluck. The Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena, a frequent presence in New York in recent weeks, returns to Carnegie as the guest soloist. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $42 and $55.

(Rockwell) NICHOLASLEICHTER DANCE WITH THE BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) Mr. Leichter, long known on small stages for his energetic, multicultural physicality, has choreographed his first opera: Carl Orff's ''Carmina Burana.''

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original F\u00e9lix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff) The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. (See above.) (Smith) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) Galleries: Uptown Robert S. Neuman: 'Fifty Years' With good-humored generosity and a skillful, sensuous touch, Mr. Neuman has painted his way through several different genres over the course of his five-decade career, including Abstract Expressionism, geometric formalism, funky allegorical narrative and painterly landscapes that mourn the losses of the American Indians. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through March 4. (Ken Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Caitlin Atkinson: 'Chapters' Comical and touching staged photographs portray the artist herself in moments of anxiety and disappointment: contemplating a dish of lasagna she burned; apparently abandoned in an empty grocery store parking lot; and starting to disrobe at a nude beach. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through March 4. (Johnson) Chuck Close, Annie Leibovitz, Vik Muniz: 'Inventive Fashion Photographs' Photographs of the silhouettes of fashion models, shaped in bent wire and based on fashion photographs by Vik Muniz; daguerreotype pictures of a naked Kate Moss; and fashion spreads by Annie Leibovitz based on ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Danziger, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 629-6778, through March 4. (Johnson) Mimi Smith: 'Drawings from the 60's to the Present' Known for witty feminist sculptures based on women's clothing, Ms. Smith here presents drawings sampling her five-decade career, including a large, three-dimensional paper house covered with fine writing protesting environmental pollution and recent sets of finely made images of shoes and underwear representing stages in a woman's life from infancy to old age. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, through March 4. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo 'Space Boomerang' This darkly theatrical show includes sculptures like Cubist bathtubs by Mike Bouchet; a bicycle with endlessly spinning wheels by Jonathan Monk; a Minimalist wall sculpture dented on purpose by Bruno Peinado; a wall that intermittently vibrates violently by Loris Gr\u00e9aud; a magical light and smoke sculpture by Ann Veronica Janssens; a video documenting Gianni Motti's walk through a particle accelerator; a motorcycle immersed in the wax of burning candles by Mark Handforth; and a long, sleek wall of black plastic-shaded lights by Lang/Baumann. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through March 9. (Johnson) Other Galleries Joe Bradley: 'Kurgan Waves' Large, blocky men assembled from flimsy, brusquely painted canvases seem to have convened for a mysterious tribal ritual in Mr. Bradley's sharp sendup of Minimalist orthodoxy. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, between Hester and Canal Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, through March 4. (Johnson) * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) 'Site 92' The second exhibition in this nonprofit gallery's impressive big, new space presents site-specific works by more than 25 artists. Highlights includes a colorful column of hovering butterflies made of candy wrappers by Luisa Caldwell; fanciful architectural elements painted on the wall by Amy Yoes; people imitating the sounds of pigeons in an audio-video work by Beth Krebs; and, by Virginia Poundstone, a tableau representing a satellite that has crashed in the jungle. Smack Mellon, 92 Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 834-8761, through March 5. (Johnson) Last Chance * HOME STORIES: AN INSIDE LOOK AT SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES IN AUSTRIA Departing from standard-issue architectural exhibitions with a slightly too clever design, this show of 21 recent houses includes portraits of their inhabitants and poster-size sheets free for the taking that function as both labels and catalog. The totality feels like a collaboration among Bernd and Hilla Becher, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and the contemporary photographer of your choice, but it makes an excellent case for the vitality of Austrian architecture. Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300: closes tomorrow. (Smith) 'I Love My Scene' This intriguing and puzzling exhibition organized by Jos\u00e9 Freire, director of Team Gallery, includes photographs of movie stars and models by Cecil Beaton; pictures of murder and accident victims by Weegee; faux-antique architectural studies drawn by Pablo Bronstein; and large sculptures by Keith Sonnier, Banks Violette and Lothar Hempel. Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 752-2929; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) EIRIK JOHNSON: 'BORDERLANDS' Small, serendipitous encounters in the landscape are the subjects of Eirik Johnson's large color photographs: junk hung picturesquely on a wire fence along a shore; a red sweater splayed between trees in a woods; a fragile, impromptu bridge of skinny logs laid across a creek. In one photograph, a huge crumple of grayish fabric plopped on grass and maybe used as a shelter has the imposing look of a sculptural boulder. There are no control-freak setups here. Rather, it seems that Mr. Johnson helps the camera make its own discoveries, often with poetic results. Yossi Milo Gallery, 525 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-0370; closes tomorrow. (Glueck) * ZILVINAS KEMPINAS In contrasting works, this artist uses videotape to create one environment and record another. The resulting Op Art installation and a record of a bike ride through Times Square conspire; sensory overload, both retinal and aural, ensues, as does a surprising application of the less-is-more principle. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3455; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'Speak: Nine Cartoonists' Original drawings and studies by nine of the best comic-book artists in the business, including R. Crumb, Daniel Clowes, Gary Panter, Chris Ware and Art Spiegelman. Pratt Manhattan Gallery, 144 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 647-7778; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * BEC STUPAK/HONEYGUN LABS: 'RADICAL EARTH MAGIC FLOWER' This ambitious gallery debut centers on a blind remake of Jack Smith's 1963 orgiastic ode to transvestism and Hollywood camp, ''Flaming Creatures,'' projected on a wall opposite the original, with Ms. Stupak's subtitlelike storyboards appearing in between. The contrast is mutually enhancing up to a point; the Stupak provides color and detail missing from the blurry, black-and-white Smith film, but the earlier effort still carries the day. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * TRIFECTA This energetic curatorial face-off consists of three exhibitions devoted to young artists (nearly 20 in all), organized by the gallery's owner, Becky Smith, and her assistants, Esme Watanabe and Erica Samuels. The three groupings progress from minimal to hyper-real, with Ms. Watanabe's selection, which lands somewhere in the middle, edging out those of her colleagues. Sara VanDerBeek's set-up photographs, which suggest a Surrealist's garret, are a find. Bellwether, 194 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-5959; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Johannes Wohnseifer: 'New Alphabet' Paintings and sculptures in several different styles by this brainy young German conceptualist obscurely explore semiotics relating to the industrial, military, political and popular entertainment spheres. He has a keen sense of design, and the sculptures made of pieces of shiny bent metal and thick felt are extremely elegant. But over all, his project looks like that of an academic theory wonk. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-7335; closes tomorrow.
