Enthusiasm for the balloon is growing rapidly. It could easily become more popular than other more drastic approaches to obesity. At the same time concerns are being voiced over the possibility of premature widespread use and overuse of the balloons, especially among those who are merely overweight rather than obese. ''This the first new development I've gotten excited about in the 10 years I've been a gastroenterologist,'' remarked Dr. Allan Menachem of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. ''Finally, a physician can do something for patients who have failed at everything and are desperate.''
