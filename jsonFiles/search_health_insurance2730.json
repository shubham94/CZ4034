Families of many of the 253,000 children in the state who lack health insurance earn too much money to qualify for state programs but not enough to pay for private insurance, the governor's office said. The plan would allow families to pay adjusted rates for coverage based on their income. The state would pay the difference between that and the actual cost. The state expects to save money by having a case management program focused on providing preventative care, to reduce emergency care and hospitalizations. The coverage would include prescription drugs, mental health services, doctor and hospital visits and dental and vision care. The legislation will be considered later this month.
