A wide-ranging law adopted unanimously by the State Legislature last month provides for sex education in public schools, grants for programs to counsel teen-agers, abortions without the necessity of parental consent and the establishment of a state adoption center. But what has caught the attention of most Wisconsin parents and teen-agers is a section known as the ''grandparents liability law.'' Under this law, parents of teen-agers who have babies are now legally obligated to provide financial support for those babies ''so far as the parent is able'' and the teen-ager is not. The obligation would continue until the teen-ager turns 18 years old, marries or joins the military. This portion of the Abortion Prevention and Family Responsibility Act of 1985 is being hailed and damned in equal measure, and all before it has actually been implemented in any concrete way.", "headline": {"main": "FOR PARENTS OF PREGNANT CHILDREN, NEW LIABILITY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1335, "_id": "4fd169ff8eb7c8105d65a2a1", "snippet": "The state that pioneered the open primary, income taxes and unemployment compensation has now devised a novel approach for addressing teen-age pregnancy.

''From our findings and independent studies, approximately 60 percent of the plumbers are cheating.'' Kenneth Christensen, a member of the Huntington plumbing board that regulates and establishes licensing requirements, said that he was not sure the cheating was that widespread, but that he was aware of some in his town.
