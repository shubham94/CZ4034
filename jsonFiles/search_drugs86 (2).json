Died peacefully at her home in Manalapan, FL on July 21, 2015. She was 97 years old. An avid tennis player and fan, music lover and food journalist, Vivian was also an author of poetry and won several awards for her work. Vivian was born in New York City, daughter of the late Dr. Simon L. Sternfield and Pauline Tonkonogy Sternfield.

She received a B.A. degree from Hunter College, an M.A. degree from Columbia University, and a Ph.D. from New York University. In 1941 she became Food Consultant and Lecturer for L.

She conducted classes in nutrition and food preservation in Newark under the auspices of the American Red Cross. She also served as Food and Home Editor for Fawcett, Hearst and Curtis Publications. Vivian won the American Dairy Association Award for distinguished food journalism. She was a member of Pi Lambda Theta, Honor Society of the Education profession and Kappa Omicron Nu, Honor Society of the Home Economics profession. Vivian was a member of the following: New York Academy of Sciences, American Dietetic Association, Greater New York Dietetic Association, Food and Nutrition Council of New York, American Home Economics Association and Les Dames DEscoffier; and was, in her later years, frequently found with friends at one of her favorite clubs, La Coquille in Manalapan, FL. Dr. Schulte, as she liked to be referred to, was an avid fan of the Metropolitan Opera and was known to participate from her seat from time to time. She was most proud in her later years of her poetry, for which she won numerous awards and was recognized in various publications. Dr. Schulte is survived by 5 grandchildren: Margot Levinson Gantz, Drew Levinson, John Levinson, Lucy Schulte Danziger, Peter Schulte; nine great grandchildren and four nephews: Tom, John, Mark and Jonathan Sternfield.
