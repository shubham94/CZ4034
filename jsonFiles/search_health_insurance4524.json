The City put two health experts on a conference call to discuss the figures. One is Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of community pediatrics for Montefiore Medical Center, in the Bronx, which delivers primary care throughout the city. The other is Dr. Mary Ann Chiasson, the Health Department's Assistant Commissioner for Disease and Prevention Research. Melinda Henneberger, a New York Times reporter who covers health issues, moderated the discussion. Below are excerpts. Q. How we can explain this and how do we tell if it's a blip or not? CHIASSON What happens is that because health center districts are fairly small and the number of infant deaths is quite small in each of the districts, the rates are very unstable. And if you look at, for instance, just a simple graph of the infant mortality rate in Central Harlem over time, you'll see that the actual line bounces up and down all over the place. . . . In fact the overall trend in Central Harlem, like the rest of the city, is going down. . . .", "headline": {"main": "When Babies Die: What the Numbers Mean", "kicker": "NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "word_count": 999, "_id": "4fd1c4788eb7c8105d6f431c", "snippet": "A recent study by the city's Health Department indicates a sharp increase in the infant mortality rate of Central Harlem, from 15.9 deaths per thousand live births in 1992 to 25.2 in 1993.
