Seemingly overnight, Mr. Rowman, who had been running his own business and going to work every day, became so confused that his children considered putting him in a nursing home. But before that happened, the family consulted a geriatric specialist who suspected that the medication given to him in the hospital, and not any organic brain deterioration, might be causing his confusion. When the drug was discontinued, Mr. Rowman became his old self again, and after being discharged from the hospital, he returned to work. Is Something Really Wrong? Many things occur as people age.

Amella noted in a recent issue of The American Journal of Nursing, ''Heart muscles thicken, arteries stiffen, lung tissues diminish, brain and spinal cord degenerate, kidneys shrink, and bladder muscles weaken.''", "headline": {"main": "Aging and Infirmity: Twinned No Longer", "kicker": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": "Jane E Brody Personal Health column describes symptoms of illness or other medical problems in elderly people that are often misdiagnosed or attributed to aging; Dr Elaine J Amella, Medical University of South Carolina College of Nursing associate dean of research, provides possible explanations for symptoms; drawing (M)", "print_page": "7", "word_count": 1182, "_id": "4fd2443c8eb7c8105d7de500", "snippet": "Do not assume that a symptom is a normal sign of aging.
