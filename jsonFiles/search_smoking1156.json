The main thrust of their whining is that physicians in all specialties are paying too much in malpractice insurance premiums because of excessive awards to generally litigious patients who are egged on by avaricious lawyers eager to prey on them on a contingency basis. Their solution is to pass laws that will dramatically limit awards so their insurance rates can be reduced to reasonable amounts. This is analogous to solving our crime problems by giving shorter or no sentences to lawbreakers. To reduce crime, we must stop criminal behavior, which has been unsuccessfully attempted since the beginning of civilization. To reduce malpractice costs is easier. We need only reduce malpractice. I have never sued a doctor for malpractice, nor has anyone close to me. I am satisfied with my internist. He has enough respect for his patients not to keep them waiting for an appointment. He or a covering physician is available during off hours. He always explains his diagnosis and recommended treatment. He answers all questions thoroughly. If medication is indicated, he explains what it is, how to use it and what side effects to expect. I do not know if he has ever been sued for malpractice; I would be shocked if he were and lost.", "snippet": "IN the last few years, in these pages and elsewhere, we have been bombarded by propaganda from the medical establishment concerning malpractice.
