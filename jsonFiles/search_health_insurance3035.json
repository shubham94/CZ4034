Less well remembered is how close Washington came to creating a very different system. Not long before Medicare's passage, the Kennedy administration seemed on the verge of a compromise with Senator Jacob Javits, the moderate Republican from New York. Senator Javits and his allies wanted to give private insurance a leading place in the new program so government could play a smaller role -- an idea opposed by liberal Democrats and organized labor. The opposition won out, and the private insurance idea seemed consigned to the dustbin of history. At least it was until last week, when both the House and Senate passed bills that would give private health plans a huge new stake in Medicare as well as provide prescription drug benefits. With pressure from President Bush to pass legislation, Congress stands on the threshold of the biggest overhaul of Medicare since its inception.
