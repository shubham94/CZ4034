Traffic at your 12 o'clock!\" A tightly wound Tom Zaccheo, one of the control-room veterans, sinks his teeth into his cuticles and turns, glowering, to the controller by his side: \"Hey, watch your goddamned planes -- you're in my airspace!\" Two scopes away, the normally unflappable Jim Hunter, his right leg pumping like a pneumatic drill, sucks down coffee and squints as blips representing 747's with 200 passengers on board simply vanish from his radar screen. \"If the F.A.A. doesn't fix this goddamned equipment,\" he fumes, retrieving the blips with his key pad, \"it's only a matter of time before there's a catastrophe.\" And Joe Jorge, a new trainee, scrambling to keep his jets safely separated in the crowded sky, is actually panting down at the end as he orders pilots to turn, climb, descend, speed up, slow down and look out the cockpit window, captain! From the passenger seat of a moving airplane, the sky over New York City seems empty, serene, a limitless ocean of blue. But on a controller's radar scope, it looks more like a six-lane highway at rush hour with everyone pushing 80. On the Sunday after Thanksgiving -- usually the busiest air-travel day of the year -- jets are barrelling toward Newark just 1,000 feet above the propeller planes landing at Teterboro. Newark departures streak up the west side of the Hudson River just as La Guardia arrivals race down the east. And in the darkened operations room of the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control -- the vast air traffic facility in Westbury, L.I., that handles the airspace over New York City -- the controllers curse and twitch like a gathering of Tourette sufferers, as they try to keep themselves from going down the pipes.", "headline": {"main": "Something's Got to Give"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "42", "word_count": 9231, "_id": "4fd1f4598eb7c8105d74d29c", "snippet": "All the way down the bank of radar scopes, the air traffic controllers have that savage, bug-eyed look, like men on the verge of drowning, as they watch the computer blips proliferate and speak in frantic bursts of techno-chatter to the  pilots:...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/24/magazine/something-s-got-to-give.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NEWARK INTERNATIONALAIRPORT (NJ)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Darcy", "lastname": "Frey"}], "original": "By Darcy Frey"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1996-03-24T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "lead_paragraph": "For many Long Island homeowners, few things in life are treasured more than the beauty of their leafy shade trees and lush green lawns.
