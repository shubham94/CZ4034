I don't ordinarily stuff the birds I roast. But planning a turkey dinner for 20, I reflect on my options. I could make the stuffing with chestnuts, but I'd have to roast and peel them -- a tedious business. I could make it with dried fruit and bread crusts, but meat with fruit is a bore. I like cornbread in my stuffing, but it's a bother to bake and a risk to buy. I love the chicken liver and ricotta recipe, but Aunt Helen doesn't. What to do? My choice of stuffing at Thanksgiving influences my feelings about the holiday as a whole. Like other holidays, Thanksgiving is devoted to exceeding limits. We are supposed to get drunk on New Year's Eve and Purim; Christmas is required to be an orgy of generosity. But never do I receive such blanket permission for excess as I do from the spectacle of a plump turkey.", "snippet": "On Thanksgiving you are invited to hurl aside moderation, restraint and the bad conscience with which you routinely approach the table.", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "THANKSGIVING DAY", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "OBESITY", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "FOOD", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "33", "type_of_material": "Op-Ed", "word_count": 720, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}, {"news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "document_type": "article", "_id": "4fd251138eb7c8105d7f55f5", "headline": {"main": "BUSINESS DIGEST"}, "pub_date": "2005-11-24T00:00:00Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "source": "The New York Times", "byline": null, "abstract": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E5D91631F937A15752C1A9639C8B63", "section_name": "Business", "lead_paragraph": "Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Said to Be Looking at Hedge Fund Deal Five months into his term as chief executive of Morgan Stanley, John J. Mack is stepping up efforts to add businesses and possibly bolster his management team. Yesterday, Morgan Stanley severed ties with three former executives who were forced to leave the firm by Philip J. Purcell during his management shake-up earlier this year. While making such a break with executives whom some had hoped might return, Mr. Mack has stepped up his search to acquire a hedge fund.
