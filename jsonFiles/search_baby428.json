'WELL' Opens March 30. After a successful run at the Public Theater, Lisa Kron and her mom, played by Jayne Houdyshell, come to Broadway in this metadrama about theater, sickness and family (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this drama by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RING OF FIRE' The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CHRISTINE JORGENSON REVEALS' Bradford Louryk meticulously lip-syncs a fascinating hourlong interview about gender and sexuality with Ms. Jorgenson, whose sex change operation in the 1950's was big news (1:00). The Studio Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Zinoman) 'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'FAMILY SECRETS' Performing old jokes with meticulous detail, Sherry Glaser in her solo show brings to life three generations of a Jewish family (1:30). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!' The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737.(George Hunka) 'GREY GARDENS' As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'HEDDA GABLER' In the title role of Ibsen's destructively dissatisfied heroine, Cate Blanchett is giving roughly a dozen of the liveliest performances to be seen this year, all at the same time, in the Sydney Theater Company's visiting production. A mere one or two at this level of intensity would have been enough. But she remains compellingly watchable in Robyn Nevin's hyped-up, spasmodic production (2:25). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. (Brantley) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' A solid revival of one of Shakespeare's problem plays in which the director Beatrice Terry has opted to emphasize the humor, especially in the scenes of comic relief. A staging with handsome costumes and that for the most part boasts a fine cast, whose members have made some smart choices (2:30). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Wilborn Hampton) 'MEASURE FOR PLEASURE' A mock-Restoration comedy by David Grimm. Seeking to do a little restoration work of his own, he inserts great chunks of fresh dirt into every nook, cranny and convention of an old form. Acted to the hilt by a first-rate company under the direction of Peter DuBois, this tirelessly ribald comedy will tickle, offend or simply bore in measures that will vary according to your taste for blatantly vulgar sexual comedy (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE MUSIC TEACHER, A PLAY/OPERA' A pair of interlocking monologues surrounding a little parody of an opera, with text by Wallace Shawn and music by his brother Allen. Written two decades ago and shelved when the authors failed to find a producer, this is a minor-key, underrealized work that hits a few elegiac notes but steps too gingerly around the psychosexual trauma at its core (1:45). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SOLDIER'S WIFE' When this play first opened on Broadway, World War II was shuddering to a close, and those on the home front wanted to feel good. Despite flaws in the work, the Mint Theater Company's revival of Rose Franken's 1944 comedy is highly entertaining (2:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Honor Moore) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) * 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON' A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Moore) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'BLUFF' Jeffrey Sweet's mostly comic tale of a young New York couple whose tentative romance is disrupted by a boorish stepfather has great fun playing with the audience through direct address and such, but it is executed with too much smirking (1:25). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'EL QUIJOTE' Sancho Panza is the real star of this often rollicking but uneven adaptation of Cervantes's ''Don Quijote.'' Caution: no windmills. In Spanish with simultaneous English translation (1:40). Repertorio Espa\u00f1ol, at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. ( Hunka) * 'FAT BOY' John Clancy's knockabout satire is blessed by a roaring performance by Del Pentecost as the round, murdering title character (1:30). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo, (212) 868-4444. ( Zinoman). 'SAVAGES' Lurking somewhere in this stiff new play by Anne Nelson is a compelling op-ed piece yearning to be set free. Examining a little-known episode from the Philippines-American war at the turn of the last century, the author of the popular play ''The Guys'' argues that the United States involvement in Iraq echoes that previous mess. Unfortunately, the play has too much information to impart to allow time for nuanced drama to emerge (1:30). Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) '33 TO NOTHING' A band break up while playing break-up music in Grant James Varjas's comic, sometimes poignant play. Music performed by the actors. Argo Theater Company, at the Bottle Factory Theater, 195 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gwen Orel) 'WE USED TO GO OUT' Jason Mantzoukas and Jessica St. Clair revive the tradition of male-female comedy team in this appealing sketch about a disintegrating romance (1:00). UCB Theater, 306 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-9176). ( Zinoman) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance * 'ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL' This Theater for a New Audience production inspires a quiet prayer of thanks to the theater gods. Here is that rare Shakespeare production in which there is nary an incompetent, misjudged or ineffective performance in a significant role. Darko Tresnjak and his cast find a way to make the play's troubled romance, between the adoring Helena and the disdaining Bertram, psychologically credible and even touching (2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'INDOOR/OUTDOOR' A comedy by Kenny Finkle about a housecat torn between affection for her human companion and a sexy tomcat promising a tour of the great outdoors. Directed by Darren Goldstein and energetically performed by a cast of four, it's essentially just another dysfunctional relationship tale, with little kitty whiskers drawn on (1:50). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE LAST NIGHT OF SALOME' More an acting exercise than a play, this Italian import is a showcase for the body language and physical comedy of a teacher of movement theater, Lydia Biondi, who portrays an unhappy middle-aged bar owner in 1950's Rome who meets and briefly bonds with a famous actress played by Carla Cassola. In Italian with English supertitles (1:05). LaMaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closing Sunday.(Andrea Stevens) 'OFFSPRING' Jimmy Barden's play about a rich white woman consorting with a young black radical recalls Tom Wolfe's cynical take on Leonard Bernstein's 1970 party for the Black Panthers. The comic moments don't, alas, redeem the characters' tired and tiresome politics (2:00). Presented by the Negro Ensemble Company, at the 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday.(Miriam Horn) 'PARADISE LOST, THE MUSICAL' This earnest -- probably too earnest -- musical take on Milton's epic shows off some good voices in the young cast of 20, but there's something purgatorial about it (2:00). The Producer's Club II, 616 Ninth Avenue, between 43rd and 44th Streets, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. ( Genzlinger) 'THE TRAVELING LADY' A small but affecting production of Horton Foote's 1954 play, produced by Ensemble Studio Theater in association with Baylor University, where Marion Castleberry's staging originated. Like ''The Trip to Bountiful,'' of roughly the same vintage, this is a delicately drawn portrait of an anxious spirit in search of home, in this case a young wife looking to reunite with her ne'er-do-well husband (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles.

'AQUAMARINE' (PG, 109 minutes) In this sweet comedy for the crowd that has outgrown ''The Little Mermaid,'' two likable pals (Emma Roberts and Joanna Levesque, a k a the singer JoJo) try to help a mermaid (Sara Paxton) find love and learn how to use her feet properly.(Neil Genzlinger) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden) * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott) 'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott) 'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Manohla Dargis) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'THE SHAGGY DOG' (PG, 98 minutes) Tim Allen is a prosecutor who is going, as it were, to the dogs in this revisiting of the old Disney film, which is far livelier than its namesake. Scenes in which Mr. Allen tries to fight off his inner canine while a no-nonsense judge played by Jane Curtin is holding a trial are comic gems.(Genzlinger) '16 BLOCKS' (PG-13, 105 minutes) If Richard Donner's presence suggests that his new action flick, ''16 Blocks,'' is a throwback to the 1980's, so does one of the names holding pride of place above the title, Bruce Willis. Mr. Willis has always been an acquired taste, but for those who did acquire that taste, it's a pleasure to see him doing what comes naturally. Which means holding a gun and fending off bad guys with as few words as possible. (Dargis) * 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist in the 1940's, arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the movie rise above its indie road-picture clich\u00e9s. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis) 'ULTRAVIOLET' (PG-13, 80 minutes) The latest in movies structured around eyewear and abdominals, ''Ultraviolet'' stars Milla Jovovich as a genetically modified human -- part vampire, part chameleon, all model -- and one of the many victims of a government experiment to improve on nature. Directed by Kurt Wimmer with a fine eye for the preferences of 12-year-old boys, ''Ultraviolet'' cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon (winner of the Academy Award for best actress), who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series ANNA MAY WONG (Through April 16) Wong, the first Chinese-American movie star, would have turned 100 last year. (She died in 1961.) The Museum of the Moving Image's extensive seven-week retrospective of her work continues this weekend with ''The Thief of Bagdad'' (1924), the movie that made her career (she plays a double-crossing slave opposite Douglas Fairbanks Sr.); ''Chu Chin Chow'' (1934), a retelling of the story of Ali Baba and the 40 thieves; and ''A Study in Scarlet'' (1933), a Sherlock Holmes mystery in which Wong plays a very suspicious widow. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10.

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ANIMAL COLLECTIVE (Thursday) These moody junkyard folk-poppers find a kind of romance in wails and clatter. Their cracked progressive-rock jams and urban pastoral chant-alongs map a landscape where fantastical beasts gather for ritual rocking around trashcan campfires. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sold out.) (Laura Sinagra) ANNIE (Monday) This Norwegian singer's happy dance pop takes on darker aspects as a result of her associations with the minimalist techno club scene and work with bands like the glitchy Royksopp and the art-poppy St. Etienne. 7 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra) THE ARK, PRINCESS SUPERSTAR (Thursday) The Swedish band the Ark plays fast and loose with glam regalia, trafficking in party music with titles like ''Let Your Body Decide.'' The cheeky trash-rapper Princess Superstar's raps about the joys of juvenile delinquency, like ''Bad Babysitter,'' have gained her a reputation as the female Eminem. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13. (Sinagra) BLACK 47 (Tonight) Black 47 represents Irish rock, New York style, where memories of jigs and reels and Irish history run into immigrant tales, politics and hip-hop. 6:30 and 10, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Jon Pareles) SIR RICHARD BISHOP (Wednesday) As part of the long-running trio of Bay Area jazz, folk and rock collagists Sun City Girls, the guitarist Sir Richard Bishop has had a sympathetic outlet for his brand of sonic expression -- which can veer from Middle Eastern modes to jazzy vamps to John Fahey-like rambles. He plays solo here. 8 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484; $8. (Sinagra) CHRIS BROWN (Tonight) Riding rough beats with a childlike sweetness on the single ''Run It,'' the teenage R & B singer Chris Brown snags both the adult hip-hop crowd and younger fans who liked Usher's ''Yeah.'' 8, Bergen Performing Arts Center, 30 North Van Brunt Street, Englewood, N.J., (201) 816-8160; $35 to $55. (Sinagra) EXENE CERVENKA AND THE ORIGINAL SINNERS (Wednesday) The doyenne of Los Angeles punk rock and co-lead singer of the seminal rock group X does her own thing with this band. 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra) CHIEFTAINS (Tonight) The Chieftains spearheaded a revival of Irish traditional music, playing only the oldest instruments: fiddle, harp, wooden flute, uileann pipes, bodhran, tin whistle. Then they decided that Irish tradition wasn't enough and started to look further afield: to Spain, to China, to rock. Their concerts started to rely more on personality and gimmicks than on music. But they have been returning to their Irish core, and there's a great ensemble behind the shtick. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $75. (Pareles) JOHN DOE (Tonight) The singer-songwriter John Doe has followed his years fronting the seminal punkers X with albums that are more low-key yet just as intimate. 9, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; $12. (Sinagra) THE GO! TEAM (Monday) This British group brilliantly merges the wistful nostalgic wing of sample-based post-rock with live junkyard bash, the sassy girl rap of MC Ninja, and cheerleader chants. Themes, hooks and digressions overlap. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) JOSE GONZALEZ (Wednesday) This singer-songwriter, a Swede of Argentinean descent, is one of those many devotees of Elliot Smith (who died at 34 in 2003) who do the intimate acoustic guitar and lulling vocal thing, but don't quite find the pathos. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; $15. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) JOE HURLEY'S ALL STAR IRISH ROCK REVUE (Tonight) For the seventh year, Joe Hurley and his band spend St. Patrick's night backing up an assortment of singers, including Michael Cerveris, James Chance, John S.

Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sinagra) JENNY LEWIS & THE WATSON TWINS (Tomorrow and Sunday) Jenny Lewis is the frontwoman of Rilo Kiley, and her solo material is inspired by Laura Nyro-style 1970's white soul. Her combination of school-recital fussiness and barely-caught cry is in fine form, but it's her vocal tone and phrasing that make her special. Especially here, where her pointy songbird desperation is augmented by the gospel-tinged Watson Twins. 8:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $19.

(Sinagra) THE POGUES, THE WALKMEN (Tonight through Sunday) Before every beer-brewing ethnicity spawned a punk band modernizing its traditionals with distorted guitar and aggressive, often hilarious howls, there was Ireland's Pogues. Its leader, Shane MacGowan, a man of tossed-off wit, ubiquitous slur and few teeth, has picked up where he left off before the band went on hiatus in the 1990's. Mr. McGowan is also DJ-ing a special St. Patrick's Day show at Southpaw that's sure to be wild. (See www.spssounds.com for details.) The Walkmen were part of the rock is back scene of a few years ago and are back to say it's still back. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com, (212) 307-7171; $50.

(Sold out.) (Sinagra) MATT POND PA(Tuesday) This band has lots of nicely formed indie-pop songs, none very memorable. Live, however, the band, which features a cello, delivers with a forceful crispness. Doors open at 8 p.m., show at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $12. (Sinagra) SAM PREKOP (Sunday) Part of the Chicago group of musicians that pioneered mid-1990's jazz and electronic post-rock music, the singer and guitarist Prekop is a smooth, if overly genteel, singer and a fluid player. His group the Sea and Cake benefited from his light touch and wistful vocals. 7:30 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, between Sterling Place and St. John's Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $15. (Sinagra) THE RAKES, TOWERS OF LONDON (Tuesday) The Rakes' jagged riffs and tempos suggest the Strokes, though these London boys also recall their hometown's snarkier 1970's punkers. Towers of London play dedicated glam-rock \u00e0 la the Darkness. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 (sold out). (Sinagra) SILVER JEWS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Few songwriters express their misery as poetically as the Silver Jews' David Berman. You really can't argue with lines like ''Sometimes a pony gets depressed'' and ''I wanna be like water if I can/ Cause water doesn't give a damn.'' His recent album, ''Tanglewood Numbers'' (Drag City), is his best. 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, (212) 353-1600; $20. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) STEREOLAB (Tonight and tomorrow night) The blip-blip movement of the 1990's never had such soothing purveyors of machine love, cooing socialist come-ons and retro-futurist airport lounge reveries. 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $25 and $35. (Sinagra) LEROY THOMAS AND THE ZYDECO ROADRUNNERS (Tomorrow) Straight from the bayou comes Leroy Thomas, who's part of zydeco's youth movement: singing in English and playing piano accordion, as well as the older-style single-row accordion while the rub board clatters merrily. 9 p.m., Connolly's on 45th, 121 West 45th Street, second floor, Manhattan, (212) 597-5126 or (212) 685-7597; $20.

(Tuesday) This annual concert, sponsored by the HIP Health Plan of New York, traditionally features the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis with his bluesy septet; this edition also benefits from the inclusion of Curtis Stigers, a charismatic singer and saxophonist with a broadminded approach to repertory and a retro-stylized stage persona. 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, www.jalc.org; $105.50 and $135.50. (Nate Chinen) BILLY BANG GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) As a violinist and composer, Mr. Bang favors the astringency and formal tension of the 1970's loft scene; his frontline partner here is the equally adventurous saxophonist and flutist James Spaulding. 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) PATRICIA BARBER (Wednesday) Ms. Barber's lyrical verbosity and arch intellectualism are uncommon traits for a jazz singer; she also plays piano in her working band, which features the often-impressive guitarist Neal Alger. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $42. (Chinen) KENNY BARRON TRIO (Tuesday through March 26) Mr. Barron is the leading practitioner of an elegant, economical and rhythmically surefooted piano style that thrives in any mainstream setting; he'll most likely explore at least a few different styles here, with Kiyoshi Kitagawa on bass and Francisco Mela on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) PAUL BOLLENBACK QUINTET (Wednesday) As on his self-assured new album, ''Brightness of Being'' (Elefant Dreams), the guitarist Paul Bollenback brings a sleek post-bop ethos to material ranging from Ray Charles to Puccini, with a strong ensemble including Gary Thomas on tenor and soprano saxophone, Chris McNulty on vocals and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen) * ANTHONY BRAXTON 12+1(TET) (Tonight through Sunday night) Mr. Braxton, the saxophonist and composer, is a monumental but often puzzling figure in the avant-garde; yet his influence has resonated clearly with a bright new generation of players, a dozen of whom will perform his music here. 8 and 10, with an 11:30 show tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) GREAT AMERICAN SONGWRITERS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Few musicians are better equipped to luxuriate in songbook standards than the pianist Bill Charlap; here he takes a look at the music of Vernon Duke (''April in Paris,'' ''Autumn in New York'') with the vocalist Ethel Ennis and the tenor saxophonist Houston Person. 7:30, Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, www.lincolncenter.org; $105.50 to $135.50. (Chinen) * ICP ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) The acronym stands for Instant Composers Pool, which conveys both the immediacy and the structural integrity of this 10-piece ensemble's creations; the group also happens to contain Amsterdam's finest improvisers, like the pianist Misha Mengelberg, the drummer Han Bennink and the saxophonist and clarinetist Michael Moore. 8 and 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $12, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) JASON KAO HWANG/EDGE (Tuesday) Mr. Hwang, a probing violinist and composer, marks the release of his new album on the Asian Improv label; as on the album, he enlists Taylor Ho Bynum on cornet, Ken Filiano on bass and Andrew Drury on drums. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10.(Chinen) CHRIS LIGHTCAP QUINTET (Tonight and Sunday night) A bassist with credentials in both straight-ahead and experimental circles, Mr. Lightcap fronts a group well suited to split the difference: Mark Turner and Tony Malaby on tenor saxophones, Craig Taborn on Fender Rhodes and Gerald Cleaver on drums. Tonight at 9 , Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. Sunday at 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934; no cover. (Chinen) DOM MINASI TRIO +1 (Thursday) Minasi is an estimable guitarist in experimental circles; as on his jangly new album, ''Vampire's Revenge'' (CDM), he augments his working trio with special guests -- in this case, the gutsy trombonist Steve Swell. 8 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) TED NASH AND ODEON (Tuesday) Mr. Nash is an expansively gifted saxophonist, equally at home finessing standards or chasing progressive forms of his own design. His Odeon band -- a flea-market assemblage of violin, accordion, woodwinds, brass and drums -- exposes the underlying affinities between many strains of low- and high-minded music. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen) THE PARK AVENUE WHIRL (Tuesday through March 25) This exuberant swing-minded confab pairs Daryl Sherman, the irrepressible standards singer, with Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks, New York's most transporting little big band. 8:30 p.m., Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095; cover, $71, with a $40 minimum. (Chinen) EDWARD SIMON TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow night) As a pianist and composer, Mr. Simon is both harmonically resourceful and rhythmically advanced, traits that should serve him well as he leads a trio with the bassist John Patitucci and the drummer Nasheet Waits. 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen) BOBO STENSON TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow night) With ''Goodbye'' (ECM), the Swedish pianist Bobo Stenson offered one of last year's most beautifully somber piano trio recordings. Here he plays the only live performances with the same personnel from the album: his fellow Swede and longtime bassist Anders Jormin, and the august and inscrutable New York drummer Paul Motian. 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) MARCUS STRICKLAND'S TWI-LIFE (Wednesday) Mr. Strickland, a thoughtful young tenor saxophonist, leads an ensemble of fellow up-and-comers: Lage Lund on guitar, Matt Brewer on bass, and E. J. Strickland, his twin brother, on drums. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen) TRIBUTE TO LUCKY THOMPSON (Wednesday through March 25) Thompson, who died last year at 81, was a bebop enigma, and his music has yet to be absorbed into jazz culture; next week the tenor and soprano saxophonist Chris Byars investigates that legacy in four ensembles, including a quartet (on Wednesday, with the former Thompson sideman John Hicks on piano) and a trio (on Thursday). 8 and 10 p.m. and 1:30 a.m., Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $15. (Chinen) MANUEL VALERA QUARTET (Thursday) On his new album, ''Melancol\u00eda'' (Mavo), the Cuban pianist Manuel Valera pursues a sophisticated strain of Latin jazz, occasionally tempered by classical romanticism; his message is in good hands with the tenor saxophonist Yosvany Terry, the bassist Hans Glawischnig and the drummer Ernesto Simpson. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $12 (members, $10).(Chinen) ABBY WHITESIDE FOUNDATION JAZZ TRIBUTE (Tuesday) This recital, under the auspices of a venerable school of piano pedagogy, will feature the radiant solo playing of Barry Harris and Fred Hersch (two of the foundation's current teachers), as well as that of Gregg Kallor, Michael Kanan and Pete Malinverni. 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' (Tonight through Sunday) The Amato Opera's reputation is that it conveys the spirit and love of Italian opera, though the full impact is impossible to achieve in a 102-seat theater with a cast that changes at every performance. And against the odds, the principals at a recent performance of ''Aida'' managed to make it through to the end, demonstrating a true love of the piece if not always of the pitch. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for 65+, students with ID, and children. (Anne Midgette) 'DARKLING' (Tonight and tomorrow night) In an adventurous move, America Opera Projects is presenting the premiere production of ''Darkling,'' a brave and sensitive, if at times frustrating, multimedia music theater work. With a score by the composer Stefan Weisman, ''Darkling'' is an ''operatic fantasia on themes of emotional fragmentation,'' in the words of the director, Michael Comlish, who conceived the idea of adapting for the stage the poet Anna Rabinowitz's book-length poem about a restless Polish couple who marry hastily before the invasion of the Nazis and who independently flee to the United States. 8, East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; $30 to $45. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'FIDELIO' (Monday) The director J\u00fcrgen Flimm's grippingly updated production of Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' was a deserved popular success when it was first presented in 2000. It returns with the radiant soprano Karita Mattila again singing the role of Leonora, and Richard Margison as Florestan. (Paul Nadler will replace the conductor James Levine, who has withdrawn from the rest of the Met's season because of a shoulder injury.) 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $320. (Tommasini) 'LA FORZA DEL DESTINO' (Tomorrow and Thursday) It's tempting to say that ''Forza'' has the most numbingly witless libretto and the dippiest score of any Verdi opera, but with such stiff competition, who can truly say? Giancarlo del Monaco's drab staging, first seen in 1996 and hidden away in storage since then, offers little help, but the Met has a vocally solid cast, with Deborah Voigt as Leonora, and Salvatore Licitra as Don Alvaro. Mark Rucker sings Don Carlo tomorrow, and Mark Delavan returns to the role on Wednesday. Gianandrea Noseda conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $320 tomorrow; $26 to $320 on Wednesday. (Allan Kozinn) 'LUISA MILLER' (Tonight and Tuesday) Barbara Frittoli canceled, and Neil Shicoff was sick on opening night, so the Metropolitan Opera was left with the journeymen Veronica Villarroel and Eduardo Villa carrying Verdi's opera on their reliable if not very exciting shoulders. Mr. Shicoff is supposed to take over again when he recovers, joining Carlos Alvarez, who pumps out sound in a warm, unvaried baritone, and James Morris, who takes ''stentorian'' off the pitch chart altogether. (Karen Slack replaces Ms. Villarroel tonight.) 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $320. (Midgette) 'MAZEPPA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Tchaikovsky's epic 1884 opera ''Mazeppa,'' about the ruthless 17th-century Ukrainian separatist Ivan Mazeppa, is an anguished, probing and noble work. The Metropolitan Opera deserves thanks for presenting its first production of this inexplicably neglected masterpiece, inspiringly conducted by Valery Gergiev. A cast of mostly Russian singers brings conviction and palpable authority to the work, especially the baritone Nikolai Putilin as the wizened Mazeppa, and the soprano Olga Guryakova as his adolescent and impressionable wife. The musical performance is so compelling that you can almost ignore Yuri Alexandrov's jumbled and trashy projection, which clutters the opera with symbolism. (On Wednesday night the soprano Elena Evseeva sings the role of Maria.) Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $320. (Tommasini) 'THE MOST HAPPY FELLA' (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) Frank Loesser thought of his 1956 masterpiece ''The Most Happy Fella'' as a ''musical with a lot of music,'' not as an opera. Still, this musically sophisticated and disarming musical is a good fit for the New York City Opera, which has opened its spring season with a vibrant and charming production directed by Philip Wm. McKinley. The actor Paul Sorvino, making his City Opera debut, inhabits the title role of Tony Esposito, the paunchy and insecure but good-hearted Italian immigrant vineyard owner in the Napa Valley of the late 1920's. Mr. Sorvino's voice, though, is pretty raw and shaky. He's at his best when he doesn't care about how he sounds and just lets go. The rest of the cast, mostly from the musical theater world, is wonderful. Tonight at 8, tomorrow and Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 (final performance on March 25), New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570; $25 to $120. (Tommasini) 'OTELLO' (Thursday) Vincent La Selva is one of the best Verdi conductors around, but his arena these days is his own New York Grand Opera, playing free in Central Park or churches with variable (sometimes decent) singers, rather than standard opera houses. But it tends to be the tenor, not the conductor, that makes or breaks Verdi's ''Otello,'' and Edward Perretti may not be quite up to it. 7:30 p.m., Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, corner of West End Avenue and West 86th Street, (212) 245-8837; free. (Midgette) Classical Music * AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Steven Sloane leads this new-music orchestra in a concert that explores the recent influence of pop technology -- including electronica, D.J.'s and turntablists, along with computer programming -- on classical composers. Included are premieres of works by Justin Messina, Edmund Campion, Neil Rolnick, Mason Bates and Daniel Bernard Roumain. 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $27 to $35. (Kozinn) BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) A weekly presenter of chamber music concerts, this floating concert hall also offers great views of Lower Manhattan. Tonight, the versatile fiddler Mark O'Connor takes aboard his Edgeffect Ensemble (a piano trio) for a night of his own compositions. Tomorrow and Sunday, Mark Peskanov and colleagues play Mozart, Dohnanyi and Brahms. Thursday, Racha Arodaky, piano, performs Scarlatti, Schumann, Grieg and others. Tonight and tomorrow and Thursday nights at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35. (Jeremy Eichler) BASICALLY BACH (Tuesday and Wednesday) This four-concert festival gets under way on Tuesday -- the 321st anniversary of Bach's birth -- with a concert of organ and brass works by Bach, Pezel and Gabrieli. Kent Tritle is the organ soloist. On Wednesday, the show moves to Carnegie Hall, where Richard Westenburg leads Musica Sacra and the Boys Choir of Harlem in the St. Matthew Passion. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (212) 734-7688; $15 to $75. Wednesday at 7 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $20 to $120. (Kozinn) 'DUOS AND TRIOS' (Tonight and Sunday) The real title should be ''Unusual String Combos,'' exploring the permutations of violin, cello and bass. The program features Ida Kavafian and Gary Hoffman, along with Edgar Meyer, known for his abilities in bluegrass as well as in classical music, and himself composer of two of the works on a recital that also includes a Rossini duet for cello and bass, Kodaly's Op. 7 duet for violin and cello, and a transcription of Bach's BWV 1027 for all three instruments. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49. (Midgette) EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Tomorrow) This period-instrument band expands to orchestral proportions for ''Bach's Progeny,'' a program of late Baroque and Rococo works by J. S. Bach's sons, Wilhelm Friedemann, Carl Phillip Emmanuel, John Christian and Johann Friedrich. 8 p.m.., St. James's Church, Madison Avenue at 71st Street, (212) 280-0330; $40. (Kozinn) ESTONIAN PHILHARMONIC CHAMBER CHOIR (Sunday) Two of Estonia's best-known musical exports, Arvo P\u00e4rt and this choir, join in this weekend's concert. Mr. P\u00e4rt's music, accessible, meditative, bell-like, forms the centerpiece of a choral and organ concert that includes a New York premiere (''Anthem of St. John the Baptist''). It's juxtaposed with excerpts from Rachmaninoff's ''All-Night Vigil'' and a set of songs by an Estonian composer and ethnomusicologist of an older generation, with the euphonious name of Cyrillus Kreek. 4 p.m., Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue, at 84th Street, (212) 721-6500; $48. (Midgette) RICHARD GOODE (Sunday) What was to have been the sixth event in the pianist Richard Goode's Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, originally scheduled for Jan. 14 but postponed because of the withdrawal of one of the participants, will take place on Sunday afternoon, bringing this engrossing series to a close. The mezzo-soprano Tamara Mumford will sing a selection of Schubert lieder with Mr. Goode at the piano, setting up his performance of Schubert's late Sonata in B flat. Then the tenor Matthew Polenzani joins the pianist for Janacek's haunting dramatic song cycle ''The Diary of One Who Disappeared.'' 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $44 to $52. (Tommasini) ALEXEI GRYNYUK (Thursday) This young Ukrainian pianist returns to the Met Museum with a recital of works by Chopin and Rachmaninoff. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Eichler) MATT HAIMOVITZ (Sunday) This itinerant power-cellist has made headlines for bringing classical music into clubs like CBGB's. This weekend, he performs the first of three shows at the Knitting Factory, with guests D.J. Olive, a cello band called Uccello and Constantinople, a period-instrument ensemble that specializes in early music from Europe and the Middle East. The program draws from Mr. Haimovitz's new Bartok-themed album called ''Goulash'' 7:30 p.m., the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $20 to $25. (Eichler) LONDON PHILHARMONIC (Sunday and Monday) The ailing Kurt Masur has dropped out of these programs. Neemi Jarvi is the replacement in New Jersey, and Roberto Minczuk conducts at Lincoln Center. Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722; $22 to $76. Monday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $35 to $69.

LUKE'S (Sunday) Ian Bostridge joins this fine orchestra and its music director, Donald Runnicles, for Lutoslawski's ''Paroles Tiss\u00e9es'' and arias from Handel's ''Ariodante.''

(Eichler) * THOMAS QUASTHOFF (Tonight and tomorrow) The great German bass-baritone Thomas Quasthoff performs Schubert's ''Sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin'' tomorrow night at Carnegie Hall with his frequent accompanist, the elegant pianist Justus Zeyen. Tonight a Young Artists Concert at Weill Hall presents four selected singers with their pianist partners, emerging musicians who were coached by Mr. Quasthoff this past week in two public master classes. In an indirect way, this concert should also provide insights into Mr. Quasthoff's probing artistry. Tonight at 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $15. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall; $23 to $79.

(Kozinn) * CHARLES ROSEN (Sunday) Charles Rosen is as renowned for his insightful books and essays as for his probing performances. He is celebrating the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth by looking at composers who influenced him and composers who felt his influence. The current installment looks at Beethoven's fascination with Mozart by way of his Piano Sonata No. 32 (Op. 111) and his Variations on ''Bei M\u00e4nnern, Welche Liebe F\u00fchlen'' from ''The Magic Flute,'' for which Fred Sherry joins him on the cello. Also, Mozart's Fantasia (K. 475) and Sonata in C minor (K. 457). 1:30 p.m. (a lecture) and 3 p.m. (the recital), 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35.

(Holland) * WALL TO WALL STRAVINSKY (Tomorrow) What better way to celebrate a prodigious musical life than with acornucopia of music? This year's installment of Symphony Space's ''Wall to Wall'' series of free 12-hour marathons focusing on one composer spotlights Igor Stravinsky, who aroused reactions from shock to adoration in his lifetime. His work ranges from the very early (like the 1904 song ''The Mushrooms Go to War'') to the greatest hits (like ''Symphonies of Wind Instruments''). Participating artists include the pianist Jeremy Denk, the singers Lucy Shelton and Marni Nixon, the Ying Quartet and, yes, Richard Thomas and Leonard Nimoy playing, in ''Story of a Soldier,'' the Soldier and the Devil. 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-1414, ext. 286; free.

(Dunning) * YVONNE MEIER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Meier is returning after eight years to her enjoyably anarchic improvisational choreography.

(Dunning) TERE O'CONNOR DANCE (Wednesday and Thursday) Audiences and reviewers tend to feel passionately about Mr. O'Connor's choreography, loving or hating it with equal intensity. Somehow Mr. O'Connor has lived through it all and continued to produce dances. This one is called ''Baby,'' which he describes as exploding the metaphor of time passing. You decide. (Through April 1.) 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25.

Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. Her works do not lend themselves to easy deciphering, but her magic with materials and her daring compositional imagination draw you in. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff) NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's Klee's impact began to be felt in the United States. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work, from his dense, Cubist-style oil, ''When God Considered the Creation of the Plants'' (1913), to a beautifully stylized rendering of the jazz singer and dancer Josephine Baker (1927) to labyrinthine compositions like ''Or the Mocked Mocker'' (1930). 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck) P.S. 1: Jessica Stockholder: 'Of Standing Float Roots in Thin Air,' through May 1. A soaring, cannily designed installation -- made of airborne plastic bins, electric lights, orange extension cords and an old armchair topping a wooden tower -- by a sculptor known for orchestrating productive collisions of formalism and consumerism. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Ken Johnson) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. Beauty is hard to come by. Check out, among other things, Paul Chan's digital animation of shadowy objects like cellphones and bicycles, floating upward, Wizard of Oz-like, while bodies tumble down, the work cast as if it were light from a tall window slanting onto the floor of a dark room. And also Pierre Huyghe's film, shot in Antarctica and Central Park. It's really gorgeous: crosscut between day and night, fiction and reality, it encapsulates the show's operative but ultimately airy metaphor about the slippery state of art now. (''Day for Night'' is the biennial's first-ever title, after the Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut film.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman) Galleries: Uptown Tony Cragg: 'Five Bottles' In the early 1980's, this eminent English sculptor made flat, mosaiclike works out of found colored plastic objects and fragments. This show presents a set of five wall-works, each representing a different giant colored bottle composed of toys, combs, cigarette lighters and other pieces of ordinary commercial detritus. Vivian Horan, 35 East 67th Street, (212) 517-9410, through April 21. (Johnson) Jim Shaw: 'My Mirage 1986- 91' This amazingly inventive California-based artist first became widely known for a series of about 170 works, all measuring 17 by 14 inches, that chronicles the life of a white suburban boy named Billy, from innocent youth to druggy degradation to born-again salvation. The 30 pieces from the series in this show variously imitate comic strips, acid-rock posters, thrift store paintings, comic greeting cards and many other pop culture forms. Skarstedt, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 737-2060, through April 1. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Tjorg Douglas Beer: 'Hirnwaschanlage BrainWashing Plant' Something resembling a large-scale, Cubist puppet theater that looks as if it were designed and built by elementary school students is the main attraction of this German artist's first United States solo exhibition. Populated by robotic figures of cardboard and aluminum foil, with glowing light bulbs for eyes, which wield medieval weapons, it is supposed to be based on the Donkey Kong video game and to represent the interior of a brain under the influence of social brainwashing. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 744-7400, through March 25. (Johnson) Jeff Chien-Hsing Liao: 'Habitat 7' The winner of the second annual ''Capture the Times'' photography contest of The New York Times Magazine presents a series of vividly clear and colorful, wide-angle pictures of outdoor scenes shot along the No. 7 subway line, which runs through Queens. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410, through March 25. (Johnson) * MARK LECKY: 'DRUNKEN BAKERS' This cinematically gifted British artist raises his game with a stop-action animation made by simply shooting a raunchy, well-drawn comic strip for adults in close-up, turning its speech balloons into spoken dialogue and adding realistic sound effects. Shown in an increasingly grubby white-on-white cube, the work is elegantly efficient, funny and dark, and adds another twist to the convoluted history of appropriation art. GBE@Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, (212) 627-5258, through April 22. (Smith) * William Nicholson Though less well known than his son, the British abstract painter Ben Nicholson, Sir William Nicholson was a successful artist in his day. The mostly small landscapes, portraits and Chardinesque still lifes in this beautiful show offer transporting fusions of paint and imagery. Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, through March 25. (Johnson) Barbara Probst Ms. Probst displays pairs and groups of photographs made using electronically connected cameras able to shoot scenes from different angles at exactly the same time. Seeing a family crossing the street in black and white from the top of a building and close-up in color from street level creates a philosophically intriguing collapse of the normal space-time continuum. Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372, through March 25. (Johnson) Rachel Whiteread: 'Bibliography' Cardboard boxes cast in plaster are displayed in monotonous profusion singly and in groups by the British sculptor who once made a concrete cast of the inside of a whole house. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through April 1. (Johnson) Other Galleries * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed; punk and new wave rock assailed the ears; graffiti spread like kudzu; and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) THE STUDIO VISIT The studio visit, a time-honored ritual that everyone in the art world has both endured and learned from, is taken to its limit in Exit Art's latest exhibition marathon. Each of the 160 mostly short videos represents one artist's idea of, play on, or substitute for, a studio visit. It is a show that often cries out for a fast-forward button, but there are some notable gems -- for example, by Joyce Pensato, Cynthia von Buhler, Ida Applebroog, Bruce Pearson, Lance Wakeling, Taylor McKimens, Paul Wirhun, Elisabeth Kley, Christy Gast and Kim Jones. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 966-7745, through March 25. (Smith) Last Chance * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * 'EXQUISITE CORPSE-CADAVRE EXQUIS' The Surrealist drawing game provided this show's organizers -- the gallery's owner and the independent curator Robert Nickas -- with their call-and-response selection process, as well as their theme. The three dozen small works tend to focus on the body, mostly beautiful and often sexual, which only increases the fascination of the almost always illuminating aesthetic couplings they have devised. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Birdie Lusch: 'Collages' The self-taught Lusch (1903-1988) worked in a ball-bearing factory in Columbus, Ohio, and began making art as a teenager. This show presents 24 delightful pages from a 1983 album of collages representing flowers in vases. KS Art, 73 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-9918; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) P.S. 1: 'Ricky Swallow,' Extraordinarily realistic and symbolically portentous sculptures carved from wood by Australia's representative to last summer's Venice Biennale, in which three of the five works on view here were included. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084; closes Monday.
