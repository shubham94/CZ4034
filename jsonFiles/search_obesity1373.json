If as many Americans as bought these miraclepromising books actually lost a significant amount of weight and kept it off, the market for future fads would soon disappear. In fact, however, the main reason there are so many best-selling fad diets is that none of them work in the long run for the vast majority of people who try them.

When the next fad diet comes along, they're ready to try yet another magical ride on the weight-loss seesaw.", "snippet": "LAST week, another in a seemingly endless stream of fad diets hit the best-seller list.
