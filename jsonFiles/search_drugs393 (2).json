He was the youngest Director of Neurosurgery at Lenox Hill Hospital, and was touted as \"the Doctor's Doctor\" by many of his colleagues. Dr. Nobandegani was a diplomate of the American Board of Neurological Surgery as well as the American Board of Pain Medicine. He was a member of the prestigious Alpha Omega Alpha National Medical Honor Society and an Assistant Professor at NYU School of Medicine. Fariborz emigrated with his family from Iran in December of 1978, in the midst of the Islamic Revolution. He began his first day of classes as a 9th grader just 12 hours after his arrival in the United States. Working late into the night and often with a dictionary by his side, he quickly rose to the top and consistently graduated first in his class. He received his electrical engineering degree from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, only to realize that his passion lay in medicine. While working for Symbol Technologies as a researcher, he studied for his MCAT and was accepted to Down State Medical School where he also completed his residency training. He found his calling in neurosurgery while treating many police officers with gunshot wounds in the crime spree of 1980's Brooklyn. He went on to become a highly successful and respected neurosurgeon, practicing both at the Lenox Hill Hospital and the NYU Medical Center. He and his partners founded Neuroaxis in Manhattan in an upper eastside historical brownstone, which he meticulously restored and refitted to serve the needs of his patients. Neuroaxis became a pioneer approach in patient care from pain management to post-operative rehab, nutrition counseling, and holistic care. An avid sportsman who loved nature and \"beautiful America\", he often traveled to far away places to find the perfect fly-fishing spots. He loved his adopted country so deeply that he routinely dedicated his first Thanksgiving prayer to the \"blessings of this wonderful country.\" His heartfelt speeches and unique humor would move everyone to tears, only to be followed by exploding laughter. His larger than life personality, his passion for life and huge smile was contagious. His love for his wife, Jennifer, and their two daughters, Alexa and Ava was unmatched. His dedication to his mom, for whom he planted a rose garden in the backyard of his Ridgefield, Connecticut home was unconditional. His relationship with his adoring sisters was magical. He had unwavering commitment to the state of Israel and Jewish charities. For five grueling months his loving brothers-in-law, nephews and close family and friends held daily prayers for him often behind his hospital door. A memorial was held on Friday, December 6th at the Academy of Medicine in NYC. Over seven hundred people were in attendance. Many were his former patients, whose lives he had saved. Contributions in his memory can be made to Save Our Kids foundation. Headed by the angelic Dr. Tom Walsh, the S.O.S Kids Foundation (<a href=\"http://SOSkidsfoundation.org\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">SOSkidsfoundation.org</a>) is a not-for-profit that finds treatments for resistant bacteria and helps patients with severely compromised immune system. Fariborz, your gentle voice and giant laughter will forever echo in our broken hearts. You lived for the truth and you fought bravely and with dignity till the very end.
