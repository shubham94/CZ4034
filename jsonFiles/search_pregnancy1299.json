These were grim times for her. When she was 6, a disabled friend of her alcoholic grandmother began abusing her sexually. In seventh grade she began to withdraw. ''I felt there was no reason to go on,'' she says. ''I did my schoolwork and everything, but I was not happy in any way. I would just stay to myself. Everyone thought I couldn't talk for a while, because for a few years there I wouldn't say anything to anyone.'' Her first boyfriend, from her neighborhood in the slums around Washington, was physically and verbally brutal. After the birth of her first child, when she was 17, she managed to ''escape from him, I don't know how.'' Not long after, Wendy, a petite African-American woman with grave eyes and a wide mouth, was raped by a family friend. Soon after that, under pressure from her family, she married a man who was also abusive. She had three more children by him in the next two years. ''He was abusing the children too, even though he was the one who wanted them, cursing and yelling all the time, and the spankings, I couldn't take that, over any little thing, and I couldn't protect them from it.'' She also had to assume responsibility at this time for her sister's children, because the sister was addicted to crack cocaine. Wendy began to experience major depression -- not simply the generalized despair that might be expected of someone in her position, but an organic illness that was utterly disabling: ''I'd had a job, but I had to quit because I just couldn't do it. I didn't want to get out of bed, and I felt like there was no reason to do anything. I'm already small, and I was losing more and more weight. I wouldn't get up to eat or anything. I just didn't care. Sometimes I would sit and just cry, cry, cry. Over nothing. I had nothing to say to my own children. After they left the house, I would get in bed with the door locked. I feared when they came home, 3 o'clock, and it just came so fast. I was just so tired.'' Wendy began to take pills, mostly painkillers.
