Goldstone, the chairman and chief executive officer of one of the four most reviled corporations in America, looks like a man in need of a cigarette. A dismal funk has settled over the Benton Convention Center in Winston-Salem, N.C., which is where his company, RJR Nabisco, is about to open its annual shareholders' meeting. The meeting won't be pleasant for him, but what is these days? It's reefer madness out there -- not so much in Winston-Salem, one of the last of the country's pro-tobacco redoubts, but almost everywhere else. It is perhaps the worst moment in history to be a tobacco C.E.O. The industry Goldstone leads is a pariah, the Libya of American commerce. Congress has spun itself into a frenzy, weighing huge tax increases on tobacco and considering measures to let the Food and Drug Administration regulate the nicotine out of cigarettes. Wall Street, meanwhile, views the tobacco companies the way Sloan-Kettering views smoking. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation is a highly leveraged company, and its stock price is so depressed that the company's market cap -- the total value of all outstanding shares -- is actually exceeded by its debt. Goldstone, a shortish and combative 52-year-old, is Big Tobacco's prime strategist. Last year he led his fellow C.E.O.'s into historic negotiations with their enemies, the state attorneys general who had made it their mission to take down Big Tobacco. Two and a half years ago, before he became president of RJR Nabisco, which owns R.J. Reynolds, the nation's second-largest tobacco company, he was just another rich Wall Street lawyer. But now that Goldstone oversees the production of Camels, Winstons and Dorals, it seems an article of faith among tobacco's foes that he pushes drugs to children. When I asked C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, if he thought Goldstone was actually evil, he answered, ''Is it evil to know that the product you sell is going to kill one-third of your customers, and then sell it anyway?''", "headline": {"main": "Big Tobacco's Endgame"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "36", "word_count": 7306, "_id": "4fd2066b8eb7c8105d76f9d6", "snippet": "Steven F.
