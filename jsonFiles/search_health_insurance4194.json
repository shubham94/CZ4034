People in 1896 got much of the coming century wrong; we are unlikely to do much better. Here is how some of the operating myths of 1996 might collapse: The Information Age Is Knitting the World Together. Russians gobble Big Macs. Children in Bangladesh wear Chicago Bulls T-shirts. CNN beams America around the globe, creating a community of news junkies that leaps cultural walls and defies censors. English is the universal language and the Internet the tribune of the people. Now we will all be one. Right? Wrong. The notion of a global village is a product of our self-congratulation and worship of technology. We assume that if everyone sees the same programs they will espouse similar values. And since we provide much of the world's pop culture, won't everyone adopt our values? Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. When we see our products and images abroad we think of it as Americanization. For others, it is just modernization. Eating pizza and playing soccer doesn't make us Italian, any more than drinking Coke or playing baseball turns the Japanese into Americans. Sometimes the more people know about one another, the more they find to dislike. Take a feuding family. Or a civil war, as in Bosnia or Rwanda, to use a couple of current examples. The telephone doesn't make us love one another. Why should the Internet? Capitalism Will Always Rule the World. Today, capitalism is riding high, and Socialism (along with its utopian apotheosis, Communism) has been confined to what Leon Trotsky called the ''dustbin of history.'' Memories are short. Only 50 years ago, socialism was the wave of the future. Britain and France were nationalizing their industries, while backward places like China and India hailed the Soviet Union as a model of fast growth. All that seems bizarre now. Everyone wants to be a capitalist, even former commissars. Capitalism distributes resources efficiently and produces a pile of money, but it always has, along with big booms and bad busts. It was because capitalism destroyed even as it created that Socialist parties were formed in Europe and America a century ago. Capitalism survived because its own excesses were tamed through government intervention: pensions and health insurance for workers, welfare to buy off the poor. Left to its own devices, it periodically spins out of control. Then it goes into the dustbin for a while. The Refugee Problem Is Manageable. Everyone knows that the world's population is growing too fast -- 6 billion today versus 1.5 billion 100 years ago -- but hardly anyone wants to deal with it. Thanks to advances in agriculture and medicine, more poor people survive in the impoverished countries where population growth is fastest. But unable to find jobs or live off the depleted land, they swarm into megacities like Sao Paulo, Lagos and Calcutta. And they spill across borders into richer places like Texas and California, France and Germany. We like to assume that tough immigration laws will stem the tide. They won't. The great migration from the world's slums is only just beginning. Democracy Will Triumph. Democracy is infectious and inevitable, or so we believe. It has already come to most of Eastern Europe and Russia, as well as Latin America. Even the Chinese are getting restless. But democracy can mean many things -- for some, the liberty to do whatever they please, for others the ability to express opinions freely and to choose their governors. For the 30 million Russians who voted Communist in the recent Presidential elections, it means high living for a few and misery for just about everyone else. And in the fast-growing economic ''tigers'' of Asia, in societies that put a high premium on order, security and tradition, it suggests anarchy. For democracies to work, they must deliver the goods. Where they fail, the people will turn against them -- as the Germans did in 1933 when they voted Hitler into power. Democracy is not easily transplanted; some societies find it disruptive and a threat to traditional values. Its virtue is that the public's voice is heard powerfully. Its weakness is that it can degenerate into demagoguery and anarchy. The whole world does not have to be democratic for us to make our way in it. And it won't be. China Will Be the Next Superpower. Of course China will dominate the next century. It's big, industrious and growing fast. What's to stop it? Maybe the Chinese themselves. For centuries China has been the great emerging power and the bogy man of the West. Napoleon warned that when it awoke the world would be sorry. Our own strategists today have found in China a replacement for the Soviet Bear. But this scenario tells us more about ourselves than about China. There will be 300 million to 400 million more Chinese over the next 20 years, yet there is little more arable land. Millions of hungry peasants are fleeing to the cities. Conflicts have broken out between the capital and the provinces, between industrial and agricultural regions and between powerful economic and military factions. The Soviet state disintegrated to the astonishment of virtually every expert. So may China. The Wretched Will Always Accept Their Lot. Nobody says this openly, but it is what most governments think. Although we have always had the rich and the poor, the gap between them has been growing. This is particularly true of the United States, where the distribution of wealth is now in a class with Guatemala. Not only people, but whole countries are growing poorer. Wealth has become so concentrated that 358 billionaires worldwide control assets greater than the combined national incomes of countries with 45 percent of the world's population. The haves assume that nothing much needs to be done about this. They figure that with enough cops, prisons and gated enclaves, the situation will be manageable -- Watts won't march on Beverly Hills, or Central Americans on gringoland, or Africans on manicured Europe. Maybe. That's what the rich have always assumed. Sometimes they were right, and sometimes they were sorry. The Nation-State Is Withering Away. What is the function of the state today? It feeds atavistic passions, sends its citizens off to wars and interferes with the global market. Surely it will fade in the 21st century, when everyone is joined together by a common language, English, and worships the same god, commerce. Don't bet on it. Nations may merge their economies, but people resist giving up their national identities. The European Union has run into a brick wall of member states that don't want to disappear into a Brussels bureaucracy. The Soviet Union disintegrated, and Yugoslavia splintered into warring ethnic states. People like to belong to a clan. The nation-state, in one form or another, will survive. The United States Will Decline. The hardest thing about being on top is staying there. History is a chronicle of great empires that have disappeared in a trail of decaying monuments. Will the United States go the same way? Not soon. Who is to challenge us? Japan is dependent on imported resources and foreign markets. China is a demographic disaster ripe for a return to warlordism. India verges on explosion and anarchy. Brazil has forever been the country of tomorrow. Europe will never be more than a big, and contentious, shopping mall. Russia has always been a phantom giant. What's more, it is asked, why would anyone want to challenge us? The United States is a ''benevolent hegemon.'' We covet no one else's territory, demand no monetary tribute. Rather than exploiting our allies, we are exploited by them: providing security from enemies, insuring access to cheap oil and running up huge trade deficits buying their goods. We are the friendly cop on the beat, and it is in everyone's interest to keep us there. At least so we say, and so we mean. But there are two problems with this picture. First is the predicament of the overextended superpower that puts so much of its wealth into feeding its military and protecting its allies that it fails to keep up economically. Second is the fact that rising nations don't like to take orders, even from the best-intentioned protector. Adolescents want to be, and will be, adults. The United States will remain No. 1 in the foreseeable future. But 2096 is a long time away. Nothing Will Happen to Knock All Predictions Into a Hat. In 1896, Americans and Europeans basked in a golden age of prosperity and perpetual progress. They were rich, self-confident and optimistic. Then came 1914 and the war that defied all reason, the war that tore Europe apart, undermined the values of the Victorian age, spawned the Russian Revolution, opened the doors to Fascism and Communism, sowed the seeds of World War II and degenerated into the Holocaust. The world has not been the same since.
