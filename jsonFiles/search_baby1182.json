Ingeborg Oppenheimer's Oct. 23 letter taking issue with the A.C.L.U. on this case, ''The Civil Liberties of the Unborn,'' fails to consider the devastating impact that criminalizing pregnant women's behavior would have on the civil liberties of women. First, this statute, designed to force fathers to support the mothers of their illegitimate children, has never been applied nor was it ever intended to be applied in cases of alleged ''prenatal neglect.'' Essential to due process of law is that people have notice of those activities that constitute criminal behavior. In this case, the woman was given no notice that failing to get to the hospital fast enough, which is the basis of the fetal-neglect charge, would be a crime.", "headline": {"main": "Fetal-Rights Case Attacks Civil Liberties of Women"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "word_count": 644, "_id": "4fd166718eb7c8105d654350", "snippet": "To the Editor:   Consistent with the American Civil Liberties Union positions upholding due process of law, equality and the right of privacy, we are helping to challenge the constitutionality of a California criminal child-support statute used to...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/10/opinion/l-fetal-rights-case-attacks-civil-liberties-of-women-723186.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "PALTROW, LYNN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BENSHOOF, JANET"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "CALIFORNIA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHILD CUSTODY AND SUPPORT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EMBRYOLOGY (FETOLOGY)"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1986-11-10T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Financial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "CHARLES and Jeanne Atchison live near the Cowboy City dance bar on a gravel street in a peeling white and gold mobile home.
