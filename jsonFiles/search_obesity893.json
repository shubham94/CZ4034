I'm not talking about frozen yogurt; though a fine dessert, it has too little of the beneficial ingredients to qualify as a health-promoting food. Nor do I mean the heavily sweetened varieties, in which calories overwhelm nutrients, or heat-treated yogurts, in which beneficial micro-organisms are killed for the sake of a longer shelf-life. I mean plain, unadulterated low-fat or nonfat yogurt, to which you can add fruit if you like, or which you can use as an ingredient or accompaniment to a variety of dishes, like homemade smoothies, soups, pancakes and curries. Yet another option is to prepare yogurt ''cheese'' by draining off the liquid whey portion to produce a thick, nutrient-packed, creamy product that is not as tart as yogurt and can be used in many dishes in place of fattier and less nourishing foods like cream cheese and sour cream. A new book by Nikki and David Goldbeck, ''Eat Well the YoChee Way,'' provides hundreds of recipes for yogurt cheese, plus instructions for how to prepare this versatile food.", "snippet": "One of the most nutritious and healthful foods on supermarket shelves is yogurt.
