Even discounting for hyperbole on both sides, it will be important to ensure that this technology is used only on the most appropriate patients and not promoted willy-nilly for every anxious man or woman eager to exploit the latest medical fad. As described by Gina Kolata in Wednesday's Times, the technology is a vastly more powerful version of the CT scanners that have long been used to construct X-ray images of various organs in the body. Cardiologists have been frustrated that those scanners produce only blurry images of the fast-beating heart and its arteries, but now, by adding a lot more detectors, the new machines are able to produce pictures of startling detail and clarity. In the long run, the new scanners could replace the stress test, which some patients find too arduous to perform, and the much more expensive angiogram, an invasive procedure that requires threading a catheter from the groin to the heart with the patient under sedation.
