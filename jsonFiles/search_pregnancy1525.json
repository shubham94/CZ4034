Powell Jr., the Supreme Court Justice who brought a voice of moderation and civility to an increasingly polarized Court during his 15-year tenure, died today at the age of 90. An announcement from the Court reported that Justice Powell, who retired 11 years ago and had been in failing health, died of pneumonia at his home in Richmond, Va.
