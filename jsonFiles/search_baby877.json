The father, Mark Kimbrell, argued against allowing them to go, saying that among the more generic considerations like the effect of uprooting children, Moscow would pose peculiar hazards: their health would be at risk from the city's poor air quality and long winters.", "headline": {"main": "The Tie That Binds, From a World Away", "kicker": "PARENT & CHILD"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 1142, "_id": "4fd1c0298eb7c8105d6ee7e9", "snippet": "IN a courtroom in Frederick, Md., a divorced couple and a handful of lawyers wrestled last year with a central issue of being a parent: how best to create a world where a child can grow healthy and confident, curious and challenged, safe and happy.  ...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/31/garden/parent-child-the-tie-that-binds-from-a-world-away.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "LIFE STYLES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FAMILIES AND FAMILY LIFE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Felicity", "lastname": "BARRINGER"}], "original": "By FELICITY BARRINGER"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1995-08-31T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Home and Garden; Style"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Science Desk", "lead_paragraph": "FOR the first 28 months of her life, Simona Young languished in a Romanian orphanage.

Now 6, she runs, talks and sings like other children her age. Since she was adopted by a Canadian family in 1991, she has been making steady progress, says her new mother, Jennifer Young.
