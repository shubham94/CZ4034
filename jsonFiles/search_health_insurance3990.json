They are now pushing other states to go along, too. But in doing so, critics say, the companies are trying to evade their obligation to share the bounty with the 70 million policyholders who are considered their formal owners. Already, 10 states and the District of Columbia have approved legislation that would allow companies known as mutual insurers to change their ownership structure. The move permits the insurers to sell stock to investors without the longstanding requirement to pay policyholders a share of the profits accumulated in their name over decades of doing business. Many of the nation's largest insurers are mutuals, and giants like Metropolitan Life, New York Life and John Hancock are among the companies now lobbying lawmakers in their home states to make the changes.", "headline": {"main": "Cold Shoulder To Insurance Customers"}, "abstract": "Major life insurance companies, in little-noticed nationwide lobbying campaign, have gotten several states to adopt legislation allowing them to sell stock to investors without longstanding requirement to pay policyholders share of profits; 70 million policyholders are considered formal 'owners' of mutual insurers, including giants like Metropolitan Life, New York Life and John Hancock; critics say changes effectively end hallmark cooperative nature of mutual insurers; former Texas insurance commissioner J Robert Hunter charges companies would 'rob money' from policyholders; new laws permit mutuals to transform themselves into holding companies; map; chart explaining insurers' organization (M)", "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2363, "_id": "4fd1d03f8eb7c8105d70956a", "snippet": "IN a little-noticed nationwide lobbying campaign, some of the biggest and most successful life insurers have persuaded several states to adopt legislation that allows them to vastly increase their ability to raise money.
