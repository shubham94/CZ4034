The church sits in a shattered stretch of Anacostia, which has a perfect view of the Capitol dome across the river. Union Temple and its pastor, the Rev. Willie Wilson, stand close to the boiling center of Afrocentric nationalism in Washington -- Louis Farrakhan is no stranger to the pulpit -- so there is much kente cloth in the sanctuary this Sunday morning, and a good deal of mistrust for things Caucasian. But Wilson isn't talking race today. He is instead teaching about the measure of man, warning his congregants away from superficial standards, reminding them of their godly nature.", "headline": {"main": "MARION BARRY CONFRONTS A HOSTILE TAKEOVER"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "39", "word_count": 8036, "_id": "5050e6d61c22dfde670c7d90", "snippet": "THEY ARE ASSEMBLED UNDER THE MUSCULAR ARMS OF A SOARING BLACK JESUS: Frederick Douglass and Rosa Parks, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., Elijah Muhammad and Nelson Mandela -- 12 black disciples in all, painted in heroic strokes above the pulpit...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/29/magazine/marion-barry-confronts-a-hostile-takeover.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BARRY, MARION"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GINGRICH, NEWT"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "WASHINGTON (DC)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CONGRESS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BUDGETS AND BUDGETING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Jeffrey", "lastname": "GOLDBERG"}], "original": "By JEFFREY GOLDBERG"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1995-10-29T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 33}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
