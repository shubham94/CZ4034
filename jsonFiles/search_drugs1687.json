This cluster of cells, called the locus coeruleus because of its blue tint, seems to be a key place where anxiety and fear take shape and where the painful sensations of withdrawal from narcotic drugs may have at least part of their origins. The locus has become a target of much scientific study because its activity offers clues to parts of the immense puzzle of the chemistry of the brain and the derangements of that chemistry caused by drugs. In recent years scientists have made giant strides in identifying a whole host of chemicals through which the brain acts in health and disease, in normality and in such aberrations as drug addiction. The focus of scientific attention is now on efforts to understand just how that multitude of different chemicals and nerve circuits actually do the brain's work - that most complex of biochemical performances in the panoply of life on earth.", "headline": {"main": "ADDICT'S BRAIN: CHEMISTRY HOLDS HOPE FOR ANSWERS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2153, "_id": "4fd12dc38eb7c8105d5f88f3", "snippet": "THERE is a minute blue spot in the human brain, a cluster of only several thousand cells, that has profound effects on the billions of other brain cells around and above it.

''My chest tightens,'' she said, ''my palms sweat, I have a sense of dread, and it feels like I'm losing control.'' The attacks seemed to arise spontaneously in a variety of situations where ease of exit was difficult - places like supermarket lines, buses, crowded stores, restaurants and elevators. ''I immediately flee,'' she told the doctor, ''even if it means that I have to leave a bag of groceries I'm waiting to pay for.'' Mrs. Turner, a 30-year-old marketing executive who had no prior history of psychiatric disorder, was bewildered about her symptoms and worried about the way they had begun affecting her job, her marriage and her life in general. She'd started to shun restaurants and department stores and was avoiding all situations she associated with attacks of anxiety: places where she could not easily make an immediate exit. Her physician had prescribed the tranquilizer Valium, which, Mrs. Turner said, calmed her between episodes but did not block the frequent panic attacks.", "headline": {"main": "A NEW LOOK AT ANXIETY'S MANY FACES"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "14", "word_count": 1285, "_id": "4fd143f38eb7c8105d61d896", "snippet": "As Sandra Turner described it to her psychiatrist, the severe anxiety attacks she'd been having for the last six months were close to unbearable.

Mr. Lyons, 22, was soon sent to Rikers Island, where guards one day noticed he was acting in a ''bizarre and unusual manner.'' A dermatologist, a radiologist, an internist and a psychologist all examined him but failed to agree on a diagnosis. Mr. Lyons was nonetheless directed to the suicide prevention wing of the jail.
