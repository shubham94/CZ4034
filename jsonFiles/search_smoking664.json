But one marijuana ingredient may have significant therapeutic value without the psychoactive effect, according to a study by Government neuroscientists, among them a Nobel laureate. In test tube experiments, the ingredient, cannibidiol, prevented more than half of the brain cell death associated with stroke, according to results published in the July issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Cannibidiol proved to be a powerful antioxidant, neutralizing some of the ravages caused by strokes. The effect was far greater than that of other antioxidants, including vitamins A and C.", "snippet": "THE medical use of marijuana is controversial for a simple, obvious reason: In addition to the benefits, like relief for cancer-related nausea, patients get high.
