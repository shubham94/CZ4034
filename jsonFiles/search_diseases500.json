A distinguished gastroenterologist, hepatologist and expert on Wilson's disease, he came to Einstein following two years at Jacobi Medical Center as a founding resident. He collaborated with Dr. I. Herbert Scheinberg on the cause and treatment of Wilson's disease, previously a disabling and ultimately fatal hereditary degenerative disease affecting the liver and brain. His accomplishments led to his promotion to professor in 1972, as well as numerous invitations to lecture at international medical meetings. In 1974, with Dr. Irwin Arias, he developed a center for the study of liver diseases at Einstein that was the first to be supported by the National Institutes of Health. The center continues to be a magnet for scientists and trainees. Dr. Sternlieb retired from the Einstein faculty in 1993. He later moved to California, where he lived until his death. His many friends, colleagues and former patients will deeply miss him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Anne. Ruth L. Gottesman, Ed.D. Chair, Board of Overseers Allen M.
