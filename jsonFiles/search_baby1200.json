The cheerful scene masked the fact that the two dozen children in the center had been abused by their parents, sometimes severely. Child abuse is but one product of the strains of military life today, according to officers here and in Washington. Those stresses, which include repeated moves, long separations and inadequate housing, have led to violence, alcoholism, drug abuse, vandalism, abandoned families, financial mismanagement and debt.", "headline": {"main": "ARMY ACTS TO HELP FAMILIES COPE WITH PRESSURES OF MODERN MILITARY LIFE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 1799, "_id": "4fd14f778eb7c8105d63026c", "snippet": "A clown came to a day care center on this Army post to pass out balloons on a warm day not long ago.
