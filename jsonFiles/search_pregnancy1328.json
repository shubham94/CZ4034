''I'm not a future tripper,'' Gabriel says. ''I can't look beyond what happens at the moment. At the moment, we were in it. Then we weren't.'' She is relaxed, thoughtful -- flirty or inwardly amused, I'm not sure which. Once an avid raver, Gabriel, a small African-American woman who still wears an open loop of gold through her nasal septum, now works in public-health research at a major university. She's light on her feet, like a dancer. I ask her if she sees herself as falling at some particular point on a continuum of sexual identity, and she smiles. ''When I'm on the street, it's whatever turns my head,'' she replies. ''I'm a big flirt. Continuum? I don't have one. And when I'm getting down, I'm at the extreme end.'' She laughs. She tries to explain. ''All of the experiences I've had are part of my identity -- if you took a part of those experiences away, you'd take away a part of my identity.''", "headline": {"main": "Polymorphous Normal", "kicker": "LOVE IN THE 21ST CENTURY"}, "abstract": "Stacey D'Erasmo article on love in 21st century focuses on whether sexuality identity--gay, straight or bisexual--has outlived its usefulness; photos (M)", "print_page": "104", "word_count": 2540, "_id": "4fd2503a8eb7c8105d7f3a7d", "snippet": "Gabriel and I are sitting in her Harlem apartment, which smells faintly of incense.
