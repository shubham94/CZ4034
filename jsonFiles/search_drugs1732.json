In the 1750's, a British physician named James Lind showed that by including limes in sea rations, the debilitating symptoms of scurvy - the vitamin C deficiency disease - could be prevented. Those sailors given limes stayed free of scurvy despite lengthy voyages during which there was precious little fresh food; those deprived of limes got the classic symptoms: loss of appetite, bleeding gums, degenerating muscles, wounds that won't heal, dry rough skin. Hence arose the custom of supplying citrus fruits on long voyages and the popular name for British sailors, ''limeys.''

According to the D.E.P. and the developer, Kaufman & Broad Homes Inc. of Manalapan, some of the building units will be 50 feet from state-protected wetlands within the Shark River Basin, along Route 35. The area, which is said to be one of the most biologically productive small estuaries along the New Jersey coast, is the winter home of diverse species of waterfowl. Daniel Murphy, the company's vice president for planning, said that ''extra precautions'' would be taken to protect the area and its wildlife. ''In no way will we be destroying wetlands, and we wouldn't even if we were allowed to,'' he said. The island, long used as an outdoor classroom for biology students from Rutgers University, Monmouth College, Brookdale Community College and local high schools, also is the site of a statesponsored clam relay program.
