A1 Guerrillas dressed as policemen killed about 50 freshly trained Iraqi soldiers as the unarmed soldiers were heading home on leave. The ambush, extraordinarily ambitious in scope and violence, showed a high level of organization. A group called Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia claimed responsibility. A1 The top civilian contracting official for the Army Corps of Engineers has called for an investigation, charging that the Army granted large contracts for work in Iraq and the Balkans without following rules intended to ensure competition and fair prices to the government. A12 Iran Rejects European Proposal Iran rejected a proposal by Britain, Germany and France to suspend its uranium enrichment program in return for help builing a power reactor and to provide a supply of reactor fuel. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman urged those countries to offer a ''more balanced'' proposal. A14 Triumph for Gaza Withdrawal Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel won a major victory as his cabinet easily approved a plan to compensate Jewish settlers who would be uprooted from the Gaza Strip under his plan for a Gaza withdrawal. A14 Karzai Close to Afghan Victory President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan has effectively secured his position as the country's first popularly elected president. The final tally is not due until Oct. 30, but election officials and outside election observers said there was no way he could now lose his overall majority. A3 Serbs Boycott Kosovo Election Most of Kosovo's Serbian minority boycotted parliamentary elections, setting back international efforts to resolve the province's future. At issue is whether Kosovo remains part of Serbia or, as the majority Albanians want, becomes independent. A6 Fight Against AIDS in Zambia President Levy Mwanawasa of Zambia has pledged to make good on a promise to extend antiretroviral drug treatment to 100,000 AIDS sufferers by the end of 2005, despite a health-care system crippled by mounting financial problems. A14 Aftershocks Continue in Japan Thousands of residents of northern Japan camped outdoors in near freezing temperatures, unnerved by a day of aftershocks from the nation's deadliest earthquake in nearly a decade, a violent jolt that killed 23 people, injured 2,100 and left seven missing. A13 Arrests Made in Mexico Deaths Four suspects were arrested in the deaths of two American tourists who were killed last week in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero. The case appeared to be an armed robbery. A6 NATIONAL A15-18 Gore and Kerry Speak At Florida Churches Al Gore, the former vice president, visited six pulpits to exhort African-Americans to avenge his disputed 2000 defeat, while Senator John Kerry hit South Florida, clapping along with the choir at another black church. Black voters are crucial for Democrats, and the party has been seeking to galvanize them in record numbers this year. A1 The nation chose sides early in this contest, and national polls show that just about 5 percent of the likely voters are still not sure about their preference. The undecideds are just a sliver of the electorate, but they very well could shift the outcome of presidential election because the races are so tight in the swing states. A1 Nevada appears to be split in the presidential race. John Kerry visited Reno and plans a big rally in Las Vegas, his sixth and seventh visits to Nevada since last winter, while the Bush campaign has dispatched officials from the Republican National Committee to organize the fight. A16 The two candidates continued a series of bitter exchanges about which would prove tougher on terror -- exchanges that have flared up whenever either has acknowledged that eradicating terrorism altogether is highly unlikely. A17 Bill Clinton has recovered enough from heart surgery to campaign for John Kerry. With just over a week until the election, the former president is headed for two of the swing states, Pennsylvania and Florida. A17 U.S. Oil Independence at Issue Both John Kerry and President Bush have said the country should wean itself from dependence on oil imports. The issue of American dependence on imported oil has come to prominence only occasionally in the campaign. A18 Battle Over Charter Schools While some try to persuade voters in Washington State that charter schools can help invigorate education, others believe equally fiercely that charter schools, which have had a spotty record, will ultimately undermine regular public schools. A15 Little Progress on 9/11 Bill Little progress has been made toward reconciling House and Senate versions of a bill that would sharply limit the power of a new national security director to coordinate the nation's 15 spy agencies. The creation of the job of a powerful national intelligence director was the central recommendation of the independent Sept. 11 commission. A18 SCIENCE/HEALTH Request to Import Flu Vaccine Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois says he has found at least 30,000 doses of flu vaccine in his conversations with overseas drug wholesalers and wants permission from the federal authorities to import to his state. A15 NEW YORK/REGION B1-6 Fatal Brain Disease Has Upstate on Edge The deaths of at least two people from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, commonly known as mad cow disease, have stirred fears in Ulster County, N.Y., despite state officials' assurances that they see no risk to public health. B1 Pattern of Early Release When Jeffrey McDonald, a sheriff's deputy in Livingston County, N.Y., was freed from prison in 1998, two months into his 18-month sentence in a drug case, the resulting furor prompted an inquiry by the governor's office. The case is strikingly similar to the uproar over the release of former State Senator Guy J. Velella in September. B1 SPORTSMONDAY D1-9 Red Sox Take Game 2 Curt Schilling allowed one unearned run over six innings, and Jason Varitek started the Red Sox offense with a two-run triple as Boston beat St. Louis 6- 2 to take a two-games-to-none lead in the World Series. D1 Racing Owner's Plane Crashes A plane owned by the Nascar race team Hendrick Motorsports crashed in Virginia en route to the Subway 500 Nextel Cup race at Martinsville Speedway. Eight passengers and two pilots were on board the Beech 200, and a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board told The Associated Press that no one survived.

B7 ARTS E1-8 Election Nears; Talk Heats Up As the presidential campaign shifts into overdrive the week before the election, so are the nation's radio and television talk shows, which plan to leave no political stone unturned and no talking head or celebrity with even slight political credentials uninvited. E1 BUSINESS DAY C1-12 Investigation of Aon Investigators for the New York attorney general have discovered evidence of deceptive and coercive practices at Aon, the world's second-largest broker of insurance, a person close to the inquiry said. C1 Marsh & McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker, may survive its criminal investigation as long as its outside directors understand that the resignation of the chief executive, Jeffrey Greenberg, will be the first of many changes they will have to make. News Analysis. C1 Safeguards at Newspapers The recent acknowledgments of circulation inflation by three newspaper companies have prompted other chains to install safeguards intended to bolster confidence in their circulation figures. C1 Hedge Fund Rules Likely The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve rules requiring all but the smallest hedge funds to register with the S.E.C. and make their records available for examination. C1 Home Web Security Falls Short The nation's Internet users are confused about computer security, 80 percent of their computers are infected with spyware and almost 20 percent of the machines have viruses, according to a study to be issued by America Online and the National Cyber Security Alliance.
