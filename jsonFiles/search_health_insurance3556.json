I worked for the Postal Service, I worked for an office cleaningcompany. I had one really good job, helping a church group with a tour of Europe. Each night, I would read upon where we were going the next day. I remember discussing Cellinis ''Perseus''after having read about it for the first time 12 hours previously. But these jobs were a matter of con-venience during my education andtraining, which was long and rigorous. During my internship, I oftenworked all night, every other night.Once I fell asleep at the dinner table,and my wife took a picture of mewith my face in the supper dish. My first real job wasn't until 1976, when I was 32 and by then had three children. I got a job as a juniorand the emphasis is on junior faculty member at Harvard Medical School. I was assigned to develop anacademic research and teaching program on aging the first ever. I had my own research laboratory, and I could design and conduct my own experiments. While this was agreat honor, to be made chief of a new unit, the downside was that the initial pay was so bad I couldn't support my family and had to moonlightas a nephrologist at a dialysis clinic. It was a steep uphill battle to establish a new area of medicine in aschool that had been around for hundreds of years. I felt like Sisyphus, pushing the rock uphill every day only to have it roll back down. Overtime we built the nation's largest academic research program on aging. As for Aetna, it looks very much to me like my first job at Harvard. Health insurance is broken in this country, and we need to re-engineer it.
