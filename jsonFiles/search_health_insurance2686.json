Speaking to an audience that included eminent scientists like Dr. James Watson, who helped discover DNA, Mr. Clinton pronounced that ''today we are learning the language in which God created life.'' Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain chimed in via satellite, ''For most of us, today's developments are too awesome to comprehend.'' Turns out that Mr. Blair was right, although not quite in the way that he intended. Despite the high-flying talk and the abundant news media coverage of the announcement, the public greeted the event with vague interest, a touch of bewilderment, varying degrees of ennui -- and then quickly forgot about it. This general indifference to one of science's landmark achievements has persisted even as the science and technology involved have yielded some remarkable discoveries. We now know, for example, that a vast majority of our genome is composed of repetitive nonsense sequences, and that instead of humans having the 100,000-plus genes previously predicted, we have somewhere in the neighborhood of 25,000, many of which we share with all other living things, a fact that anchors us firmly in the process of evolution (whether a creative intelligence was involved or not).", "headline": {"main": "Decoding Health Insurance", "kicker": "Op-Ed Contributor"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "13", "word_count": 1331, "_id": "4fd25e8e8eb7c8105d80d919", "snippet": "The genomic case for universal health coverage.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/opinion/22cook.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "imagepages/2005/05/21/opinion/20050522_cook.html", "rank": "1", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupWidth1": "250", "MultimediaUrl1": "imagepages/2005/05/21/opinion/20050522_cook.html", "MultimediaPopupHeight1": "325", "MultimediaType1": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "images/2005/05/21/opinion/20050522_cook_75.gif", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/05/21/opinion/20050522_cook_75.gif"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55, "height": 55}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "INSURANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DNA (DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID)"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Robin", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Cook"}], "original": "By Robin Cook"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-05-22T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National Desk", "lead_paragraph": "For two years, health policy experts have been warning that Medicare beneficiaries may be confused by complexities of the new prescription drug benefit.
