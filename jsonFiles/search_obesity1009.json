The first, ''At Dinner, More Americans Are Saying 'Cheese' and Smiling,'' described the increasing popularity of serving cheese in restaurants, but it failed to point out that the main ingredients in cheese, salt and fat, should be avoided whenever possible. Is that something to smile about? The second article, ''Size 14, 190 Pounds: A Model Figure,'' was a paean to gluttony, in this case that of Emme, a highly successful ''plus size'' model, who manages to profit from her self-indulgence because she has high cheekbones and a pretty face that is less padded than her frame. Emme proudly asserts that ''a cookie is just a cookie,'' just as we used to say -- in a more innocent past -- that ''a smoke is just a smoke.''", "snippet": "To The Living Section:    It was disappointing that The Living Section of March 12 contained two articles about eating that ignored important health issues.
