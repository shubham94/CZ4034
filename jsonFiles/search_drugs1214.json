But the disease has had a major impact in areas where those groups -- homosexuals, drug users, the poor and the undereducated -- are concentrated, like New York City, the study said. Strikes the Powerless The study said groups with greater power remain relatively unaffected while AIDS \"is burrowing into socially disadvantaged segments of our society that may be ignored by the general population and by public policy.\" As a result, it said, there is the danger that attention may wane and that \"the disease may become accepted as one of the 'synergy of plagues' endemic in vulnerable communities.\" AIDS \"will 'disappear,\" the council concluded, not because, like smallpox, it will have been eliminated, but because those who continue to be affected by it are \"socially invisible.\" Thomas Brandt, an official of the National Commission on AIDS, said the report was \"on the mark\" because \"there has not been an appropriate level of response\" in America. \"Many segments of society have not changed, but they need to,\" he said. \"While America will never be the same, some of our core institutions are continuing to do business as usual.\" Among the study's conclusions about the extent of the effect of AIDS on social structures were these: *Initially, public-health officials set aside conventional containment practices, like quarantine and mandatory testing, and developed control methods involving education. As the AIDS epidemic enters its second decade and settles firmly in minority groups, public-health officials are returning to more traditional practices, including screening to detect H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Education efforts, the study said, have resulted in wider acceptance of \"safe sex,\" including the use of condoms. *Although AIDS has put a great strain on health-care resources in some communities, most areas have been able to absorb the new patients. About 2 percent of the nation's health expenditures are consumed by AIDS, and the disease has caused two health-care changes -- increased efforts to protect the nation's blood supply and a reassessment of ethical concerns among health-care workers treating patients with lethal infectious diseases. *AIDS has instilled a new sense of urgency in developing and testing drugs and has led to fewer restrictions on testing drugs developed to compbat lethal diseases. *Widespread voluntary action arose from the gay male population, which was most severely affected early in the AIDS epidemic. But as the epidemic becomes more centered in the poor communities, the resources of voluntary actions may grow smaller. Panel of 11 Experts The National Research Council is part of the National Academy of Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress to provide scientific advice to the Federal Government. The study was compiled by a committee of 11 experts and reviewed by organizations within the academy. \"In the panel's judgment,\" the study said, \"the H.I.V.-AIDS epidemic has affected many transient changes in the institutes we studied and relatively few changes that we expect to be permanent.\"", "headline": {"main": "Research Panel Concludes AIDS Has Small Impact on Most of U.S."}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "15", "word_count": 522, "_id": "4fd1e5ae8eb7c8105d731098", "snippet": "The AIDS epidemic has had little impact on the lives of most Americans or on the way society functions, largely because it has struck most fiercely among \"marginalized\" groups, the National Research Council said in a study released today.
