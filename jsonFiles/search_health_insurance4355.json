The plan that Mr. Clinton released yesterday to balance the budget does not really meet that goal, since he used his own budget office's figures. By Congressional Budget Office standards he is still perhaps $300 billion short of the mark. Even so, the new Clinton budget is becoming perilously like the G.O.P. version. What the revised budget plan shouts out is that seven years of budget-cutting will be a very ugly process. For example, the previous Clinton budget would cut welfare programs -- food stamps, cash assistance for the disabled and aid to legal immigrants -- by $38 billion. His revised budget would subtract an extra $8 billion. The previous White House plan would have taken $186 billion out of discretionary programs -- reducing these, as a percentage of total economic activity, to their lowest level since the early 1960's. Now Mr. Clinton could cut an additional $64 billion. His plan includes steep reductions in Medicare payments to hospitals that treat the poor and train medical students. If he closes the $300 billion shortfall, then he will be forced to make mammoth additional cuts in these and all other programs.", "headline": {"main": "Mr. Clinton's Budget"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "30", "word_count": 624, "_id": "4fd1f45e8eb7c8105d74d6bf", "snippet": "President Clinton, as the price he paid to open shuttered Government offices, promised the Republicans that he would agree to their demand to balance the budget in seven years in accordance with estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
