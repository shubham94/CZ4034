Even after winning permission last week to fly between the United States and the Continent and penetrate the American market in a host of other ways -- rights no other foreign airline has had -- the British carrier is sounding defeated and distraught. It seems British Airways will have to accept some competition from United, American and Virgin Atlantic at Heathrow Airport, London's most convenient. The day before creditors were to seize Pan Am's planes, Pan Am and T.W.A. won British approval to sell their Heathrow routes to United and American. \"U.S. negotiators have succeeded in weakening British Airways,\" a spokesman for the airline intoned, as the company's chairman spoke of reduced profitability. Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, shed few tears. \"They're yelping so much it's suspicious,\" he said. British Airways already plans to invade the Continent by buying a large piece of Sabena World Airlines and forming a new carrier in Germany. The British deal hardly gives America's feeble old international carriers the strength to rise from their wheelchairs. Pan American World Airways, the sickliest case, is earning only enough from its route sale to perhaps survive until someone buys its remaining assets. And Trans World Airlines said the Transportation Department's ban on the sale of three of its six London routes to American, in the interests of competition, imperils its financial health. Maxwell's Plum, or Prune? \"Maxwell's Plum,\" said a Daily News headline Wednesday morning. \"Miracle Max!\" and \"Daily News Lives!\" followed that afternoon. Now Robert Maxwell needs to live up to his headlines. The plum he agreed to buy after settling with the unions last Tuesday has shriveled to perhaps half its former circulation of a million-plus, and even less of its former advertising. His purchase of The News -- the Tribune Company is actually paying him $60 million or more to take on the newspaper's liabilities -- is based on agreements by the striking unions to accept sharp staffing cuts. Mr. Maxwell, a British publisher, promised to invest what the News called \"mega-money\" -- not to mention the mega-time he might need in his trans-Atlantic schedule to lure scores of advertisers, several hundred thousand readers and Jimmy Breslin back to his pages. Exxon, and Taxpayers, Pay Up For a company that earns as much as Exxon, $1.1 billion actually isn't real money. No sooner had the Exxon Corporation agreed to pay such a settlement to Alaska and the Federal Government in the Exxon Valdez oil spill than Lawrence G. Rawl, the company's chairman, said there would be virtually no effect on the company's earnings or image. The company also pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors. Exxon's ability to write off the whole settlement save a $100 million criminal penalty will cost taxpayers an estimated $300 million. A Purge at Chrysler Tough times provided the Chrysler Corporation with the perfect occasion to kick a union leader off its board. Cost-saving, Chrysler called it, adding that four of the other 18 members were leaving as well. In fact, it's the loss of labor's voice, responded Owen F. Bieber, president of the United Automobile Workers, a dissident on the board and the only departing member who is not in at least his late 60's. Labor representation, unusual on American boards, hardly seems to have hurt corporate competitiveness in countries like Germany. But by reversing itself on the issue, Chrysler has carried out Detroit's most celebrated boardroom purge since H. Ross Perot left General Motors. McDonald's New Burger No, McDonald's will not draw in the bean sprouts and oat bran crowd with its new, reduced-fat burger. At best, analysts say, the health-conscious might stop sneering so loudly that they embarrass those for whom dieting means ordering the burger and fries without the shake. Diners who do try the \"McLean\" are likely to be disappointed, said Caroline Levy of Shearson Lehman. \"This doesn't even taste like a burger, based on what I've heard,\" she said. Like the company's recent abandonment of styrofoam containers to placate environmentalists, Ms. Levy said, \"It's good for McDonald's image, but I do not see it as good for the bottom line.\" In Brief American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, reduced its lowest fares -- reviving the 30-day advanced-purchase ticket -- to encourage travelers frightened off by the Persian Gulf war or the recession. But some other fares are rising. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the competitive practices of the Microsoft Corporation, the dominant maker of personal computer software. Microsoft calls the probe minor and limited, its competitors call it broad-ranging, and the F.T.C. is keeping quiet. The House reluctantly poured another $30 billion into the savings and loan bailout last week. THE ECONOMY Putting a Leash on '900' Calls The Federal Communications Commission proposes that callers to \"900\" numbers get to hear the price tags before they pay. Under rules announced Thursday, the \"900\" services would have to describe their prices and offerings, then give callers a chance to hang up before they are billed. No longer would callers applying for construction jobs learn only later that the calls had cost them $18 each, as the Government alleges, nor would callers for nearly useless credit cards end up paying $49.95. Several industry representatives blasted the F.C.C.'s proposal as a threat to legitimate \"900\" services; many provide weather, sports scores and stock information for willing customers. The F.C.C. is likely to issue its final rules by the end of the year. Harsh Message in Output Factory output fell in February for the fifth straight month, indicating that the recession continued to deepen. An eight-tenths of 1 percent drop last month brought production to the lowest level since June 1988. Lawrence Kudlow, the chief economist at Bear Stearns, said that considering last month's dismal employment report as well, the recession now looks to be as long as average. \"The short and mild argument has gone down with the February numbers,\" he said. But consumer confidence appeared to improve in early March after the war. Inflation Just Simmers Along Wholesale inflation continues to simmer despite a tepid economy. While producer prices overall fell six-tenths of 1 percent last month, the core rate, without volatile food and energy prices, rose four-tenths of 1 percent. Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover, said that like Goldilock's evaluation of the baby bear's porridge -- \"not too hot, not too cold,\" he sees the inflation report as \"not too inflationary, not too recessionary.\" Some economists say inflation remains too strong for the Federal Reserve to further ease credit. Modest Cutback From OPEC With Iraq no longer around to bluster about the need for much higher prices, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week agreed to cut production by only 5 percent, or about a million barrels a day. The agreement demonstrates the influence of Saudi Arabia, which wants to keep prices moderate enough to guarantee long-term demand for its vast oil supplies. With neither Iraq nor Kuwait exporting, most OPEC members have quotas far higher than their previous levels. News of the OPEC agreement nudged oil prices up by only 69 cents last week to $20. The Great Bankruptcy Shield France had the Theatre du Grand Guignol, presenting murder, rape, torture and suicide. The United States has the bankruptcy courts. The latest example of creative bankruptcy is an Equitable Life Assurance Society production, starring a partly empty 53-story Times Square office tower and grieving investors. The Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company accuses Equitable of deceiving other investors and trying to stick them with tens of millions of dollars in losses by throwing the partnership that owns the tower into bankruptcy. This, after Manville used the bankruptcy courts to confront its asbestos claimants; Texaco, to rebuff a challenge from Pennzoil, and Frank Lorenzo, to fend off his striking airline unions. Equitable and Manufacturers reached a tentative settlement on Friday, but negotiations on the exact terms continued. INTERNATIONAL A Bigger Slice of Soviet Pie Soviet officials harass foreign businesses, protesting crowds swarm around the Kremlin walls, but Pizza Hut's first two Moscow restaurants claim profit margins higher than in the United States. Russians line up down the block for the chance to pass an hour or two in a Western setting. But the trials of doing business in the Soviet Union have slowed Pizza Hut's expansion plans. Andrew Rafalat, the Pizza Hut executive who opened the restaurants in September, said he first needs to secure domestic supplies of meat and mozzarella cheese, to save the expense of buying them for hard currency in Western Europe and trucking them all the way in. Soviet meat suppliers are still incredulous when he asks them to meet his specifications. \"They say, 'We're giving you a scarce product. We're doing you a favor.' \" Mr. Rafalat, visiting the Pepsico parent company's New York headquarters last week, said he hopes to open some stand-alone take-out windows in Moscow by the end of the year. But as David Williams, senior vice president of Pepsico Food Service International, said, \"Nothing in the Soviet Union comes easily. Nothing is handed to you on a plate.\" Except for some American-style pizzas, he hopes. Forgiving Poland Leading industrialized nations have decided that the proto-capitalist Poles should not suffer for the borrowing binge of their deposed Communist rulers. To aid Poland's progress toward a market economy, officials meeting in Paris agreed to forgive about half the $33 billion owed and ease repayment terms on the rest. While micro-entrepreneurs have lined several of Warsaw's broadest boulevards with their booths, the most ambitious economic reforms in Eastern Europe have also caused severe unemployment. The Trade Police in Japan Inspectors and police milling around an American rice exhibit at a Tokyo food show last week became, in the view of American officials, a prime exhibit of Japanese protectionism run amok. Japanese officials insisted that the sealed bags and plastic containers of American rice, if not the \"Have a Rice Day\" bumper stickers, violated laws against rice imports. Americans insisted the display was solely educational.", "headline": {"main": "Business Diary/March 10-15"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 1681, "_id": "4fd1a82d8eb7c8105d6c379e", "snippet": "COMPANIES British Airways Whines About Its New Competition  British Airways P.L.C. wants sympathy.
