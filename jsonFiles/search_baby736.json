Many drugs (and druglike substances, including coffee, alcohol and tobacco) were tested in laboratory animals or studied in pregnant women. Some were found to be potential hazards to developing fetuses, usually only at the beginning of pregnancy but in some cases only near the time of birth and in others throughout gestation. Now most pregnant women are cautioned to avoid any and all medications that are not absolutely essential, as well as ''pleasure drugs'' like alcohol and tobacco and sometimes coffee and caffeine. But while this is sound advice in general, it can often result in needless discomfort for women who avoid taking a harmless drug that could help them. It also causes undue anxiety among those women who must take medication or who inadvertently took one or more drugs before they knew they were pregnant.", "headline": {"main": "Drugs, Safe and Not Safe, in Pregnancy", "kicker": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": "Jane E Brody column on drugs that pregnant women can safely take and drugs they should avoid; drawing (M)", "print_page": "8", "word_count": 1321, "_id": "4fd210af8eb7c8105d785137", "snippet": "The thalidomide tragedy of the 1960's touched off intense concern and a vast amount of research about the safety of drugs taken during pregnancy.
