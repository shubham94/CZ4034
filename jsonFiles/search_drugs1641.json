In interviews, educators in the suburbs of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut said their schools did try to introduce students to values, such as honesty, discipline and respect for others and for the rule of law. But they said most of this instruction was indirect, by the example of the staff's conduct, or embodied in the rules of the school. Values are much less discussed in public schools now than they were in the late 1960's, educators say. And specific courses in values or religion or democracy, once popular in high school curriculums, are now rare, in part because they are controversial and in part because there are few teachers trained to give them.", "headline": {"main": "PUBLIC SCHOOLS AVOID TEACHING RIGHT AND WRONG"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 1440, "_id": "4fd15fdc8eb7c8105d6493bd", "snippet": "At a time of increased pressure from top Federal officials and some educators and parents groups for public schools to teach moral values, many educators in the New York area say they deliberately avoid trying to tell students what is ethically right...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/02/nyregion/public-schools-avoid-teaching-right-and-wrong.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TEACHERS AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Jonathan", "lastname": "FRIENDLY"}], "original": "By JONATHAN FRIENDLY"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1985-12-02T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Education; New York and Region"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "lead_paragraph": "STANDING AROUND A BROAD OVAL table in a partially darkened room are seven men.
