Republican leaders in the House and Senate charge that the Supplemental Security Income program -- which provides up to about $450 a month for disabled children from poor families -- is riddled with abuse. They propose stiffer requirements that could drive out nearly 300,000 of the 900,000 children who are currently enrolled. Accusations that the program pays cash to children not in need are based on anecdotes that tell of parents coaching their children to fake mental disabilities.

Across town, things are also hopping at Viagene Inc., one of the first gene therapy companies to attract a deep-pocket buyer.
