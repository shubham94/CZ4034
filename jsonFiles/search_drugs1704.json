The research was performed in the 1970's by Dr. Wilbert S. Aronow, now director of cardiovascular research for the Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha. Last year, after the Food and Drug Administration charged him with falsifying test results, Dr. Aronow signed an agreement with the agency in which he promised to conduct no more testing of experimental drugs without special permission. Dr. Aronow said by phone that his research on carbon monoxide was accurate and a report on a review of his work was full of errors. The new carbon monoxide standard, scheduled to have been put into effect in the next few weeks, would essentially maintain the current rule stating that the average permissible amount of the gas in the air is 9 parts per million in any eight-hour period. This standard would allow a specific area to exceed this level once a year. The proposal would also have reduced the maximum carbon monoxide in the air in any one hour to 25 parts per million from the current level of 35 parts per million.", "headline": {"main": "CARBON MONOXIDE STUDY IS FLAWED, E.P.A.
