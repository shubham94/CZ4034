The baby's parents, an American couple, had two other children and probably could have had another if they wished; neither parent was infertile, and both were healthy and in their 30's. But they did not want another child. They wanted this child. And before long, they began to believe that the longing they felt was telling them something quite specific -- that their dead baby's genes were crying out, as a ghost might, to express themselves again in this world. The idea preoccupied them that their little son's genotype deserved another chance, that it had disappeared by mistake and could be brought back by intention. Now if all this had happened, say, five years ago, their conviction might have soon faded away. The couple might have told their friends or family about this secret dream of resurrecting their baby's genes, and been talked out of it, or comforted in some other way. But it happened last year -- four years into the cloning revolution sparked by Dolly the sheep, at a moment when optimism about the miracles of biotech was running high and when it was not at all hard to find other people who shared a kind of metaphysical faith in the power of genes. One such group, a science-loving, alien-fixated religious movement called the Ralians, for whom cloning is a central tenet, was particularly eager to put its faith into action. Last June, the grieving couple and the Ralians found one another (on the Internet, of course) with results that could -- and should -- reopen the whole debate over whether human beings ought ever to be cloned, and for what purpose.", "headline": {"main": "The Cloning Mission; A Desire to Duplicate"}, "abstract": "Margaret Talbot article on human cloning; cites efforts of Raelians, science-loving, alien-fixated sect for whom cloning is central tenet; notes efforts are financed by grieving parents seeking to revive genotype of baby who died in infancy; sees effort reopening debate over human cloning; notes bioethicists have largely embraced cloning as extension of technologies to aid infertile; photos (L)", "print_page": "40", "word_count": 8048, "_id": "4fd2050c8eb7c8105d76cc6e", "snippet": "Last year, a 10-month-old baby boy died in the hospital after a minor operation went wrong.
