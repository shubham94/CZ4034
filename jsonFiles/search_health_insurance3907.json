As surveys indicate, middle America is more upscale than it used to be -- liberal socially, conservative economically. In the following data stream, moderation reigns, strikingly so, perhaps explaining why Bill Clinton and his poll-tested policies have stayed popular during this Presidential annus horribilis. * The typical American family -- a white married couple with 1.89 children -- lives in a house it owns and has a pet, most often a mixed-breed dog or a nothing-special domestic short-hair cat. * Favorite sport utility vehicle: the Ford Explorer. * Most couples consider good sex vital to a marriage's success, but have sex about once a week -- for an average of 39 minutes. * Given $1,000 to invest, 73 percent of respondents in a recent survey would still bet on stocks. * The Top 10 things recently ranked by Americans as in: jeans, the Internet, female athletes, gourmet coffee, kids, alternative medicine, ethnic food, angels and volunteerism. * Growth of red-wine sales in the U.S. from 1991 to 1997: 151 percent. * Growth of Internet usage since 1995: 167 percent. * Almost everybody -- 99 percent -- thinks the Government wastes a portion of their tax dollars. * Most doubt that they will be able to afford health care in the next 10 years. * Most believe contraceptives should be covered by health insurance, even if premiums rise slightly. * A majority of Americans now dress casually for work everyday. * Seven of 10 want stricter gun-control laws and oppose repealing the assault-weapons ban. * The number of Americans who have tried cappuccino, latte or another espresso-based product grew by 34 percent from 1997 to 1998. * Seventy-six percent of Americans oppose a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion. * Sixty percent of all U.S. households carry credit-card debt. Average balance: $7,000. * Three of four families still eat together regularly, but the dinner hour is speedy -- 30 minutes or less. * A majority of Americans, of all races, support mending not ending affirmative action. * Most Americans (80 percent) support President Clinton's plan to lower the average class size in public schools. * More than 90 percent feel safe in their neighborhoods. * The average American family generates more than 2,500 pounds of garbage each year; 76 percent recycle cans, bottles or paper. * Nearly two-thirds don't find the air nearly clean enough -- and want Uncle Sam to do something about it. * Two-thirds want to restrict human cloning. * Favorite pizza topping: pepperoni. * Eight of 10 adults agree that the Social Security system faces serious problems requiring Congress' immediate attention. * Two-thirds favor allowing homosexuals to serve in the military. * Sixty-three percent think a sexual encounter between a powerful man and a less-powerful woman at the office does not automatically constitute sexual harassment. * Favorite actress: Meg Ryan and Helen Hunt (tie). * Favorite airline for long-distance flights among frequent fliers: T.W.A. * Ninety percent own dental floss, but most neglect to use it every day. * Americans, by a 2-to-1 margin, oppose bilingual education; most people would agree to carry a national identity card if that deterred illegal immigration. * Most people agree with the statement, ''The United States Constitution is important to me,'' but more than half don't know that there are 100 senators. More American teen-agers can name the Three Stooges than the three branches of the Federal Government. * An overwhelming majority believe in God (and most believe in the devil, too), belong to a church and pray silently at least once a day. * Favorite style of eggs: scrambled. * Most voters want TV and radio networks to provide political candidates with free air time. * A majority believe the government should ban smoking in public places like stores and restaurants. * Favorite sneakers: Nike.", "headline": {"main": "Typical; The Likes and Dislikes of Today's Everyfamily"}, "abstract": "Table of likes and dislikes of typical American family; photo1", "print_page": "43", "word_count": 676, "_id": "4fd20b288eb7c8105d779446", "snippet": "When Americans go to the polls on Tuesday, don't expect seismic shifts -- or even loud noises.
