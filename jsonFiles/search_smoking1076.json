Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services, has recommended that part of the revenue from the Federal excise tax on cigarettes be earmarked for Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund. The trust fund, which helps pay hospital bills of elderly and disabled people, is expected to run out of money in the early 1990's, according to economists at the Congressional Budget Office and actuaries at the Social Security Administration. Administration officials said Mrs. Heckler suggested at a meeting Friday with President Reagan that the cigarette tax be kept at its current level of 16 cents a pack, with about half the total revenue to be dedicated to the Medicare hospital trust fund. The excise tax on cigarettes was doubled to 16 cents in January 1983 and is scheduled to drop back to 8 cents in October of this year. The tax generated $4.1 billion of Federal revenue in the fiscal year 1983, the last full year for which data have been issued by the Internal Revenue Service.", "snippet": "Margaret M.
