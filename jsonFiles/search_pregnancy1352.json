Dole cheerfully informed the talk-show host that there was a new drug, Viagra, and miraculously, it had cured the problem. King asked Dole if he would discuss it on the air, and Dole said sure, why not? The world was about to become a very different place. Viagra would cycle through the expected paces of pop-culture acceptance with stunning speed. Leno and Letterman got an entire summer's worth of monologues off the subject. For a while the papers regularly pumped out clowning (and possibly true) stories about the drug -- there was Frank Bernardo, 70, who left his wife, declaring, ''It's time for me to be a stud again''; there was also Gen.

Millions upon millions of religious and nonreligious people have been directly or indirectly affected by the teachings of Judaism. I never read an article about ultra-Orthodox Jews that begins to deal with that history. Usually the only mention of Orthdox Judaism is a statement that men say a prayer thanking God for not having created him a woman. In Leslie Cahmi's article ''The Ultra-Orthodox and Their Women'' [Feb. 13], about Amos Gitai's film ''Kadosh,'' that prayer is mentioned in the first paragraph. The intention of mentioning that prayer is to focus on how sexist Orthodox Jews are. Of course, their views on the roles of men and women are different from ours today. Why is there never a mention of the fact that Orthodox women also say a prayer every day? The prayer thanks God for making them who they are. There are separate but equally important roles and obligations for men and women. For society to function on its highest level, both are necessary. Men and women are not the same. Because of biology women have pregnancy and major child rearing responsibilities. They are relieved of many of the responsibilities that men are required to perform. It may not conform to contemporary views of the role of women, but it would give the uninformed reader a better understanding than your article, and countless others give.
