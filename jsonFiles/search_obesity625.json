A1 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice went to Beirut, Lebanon, and was met with complaints about American support for Israel from protesters who dogged her movements. American diplomats described the visit as a dramatic overture that demonstrated to the Arab world that President Bush is concerned about the rising civilian death toll in Lebanon. A13 Iraq Premier Has a List for Bush When Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki visits the White House for the first time, he is expected to make requests that clash with President Bush's foreign policy, Iraqi officials say, signaling a widening gap between the Iraqis and the Americans on crucial issues. A8 The trial of Saddam Hussein and his seven co-defendants continued, making some progress even though Mr. Hussein, in the 17th day of a hunger strike, and six others were absent, continuing a boycott of the trial. A9 No Progress in Kosovo Talks Serbian and ethnic Albanian leaders met in Vienna, Austria, to discuss returning Kosovo to local governance. Ethnic Albanians, a majority, want it to become an independent state, and the Serbs want it re-integrated into Serbia. Following apparently fruitless negotiations, there was little sign of any compromise. A4 NATIONAL A14-17 Stem Cell Research Money Now Coming From States President Bush's veto of legislation to expand federally funded embryonic stem cell research has had the unintended consequence of drawing state money into the much-fought-over field and infusing the debate over the research into election campaigns across the country. A1 Lights Out in California Unrelenting tropical heat and humidity has driven demand for electricity to record highs in California and other states. The authorities in California issued a warning that the high demand could lead to rolling blackouts. A14 Changes in Detaining Travelers The Department of Homeland Security must take steps to curtail the repeated interrogation of people at international airports or border posts simply because their names resemble those of terrorism suspects, says a report released by the department's inspector general. A15 Immigration Law Rejected The City Council of Avon Park , Fla., rejected an ordinance that would have cracked down on illegal immigrants after one member changed her vote amid strong protest. A17 States Fall Short of Standards Most states failed to meet federal requirements that all teachers be ''highly qualified'' in core teaching fields and that state programs for testing students be up to standards by the end of the past school year, according to the Education Department. A14 NEW YORK/REGION B1-6 Keeping Power Running May Have Extended Misery A decision made by top managers at Consolidated Edison last week to keep power running to Queens after ten of the 22 feeder cables that distribute electricity to the borough had failed may have contributed to the length of the blackout that plunged up to 100,000 residents into eight days of darkness. A1 Clinton Praises Lieberman Former President Bill Clinton issued a broad appeal for Democratic Party unity in defense of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, touting the senator as a ''good Democrat'' who deserved to win next month's primary.

The Israeli prime minister spoke of a force consisting of European Union members with combat experience and the authority to take control of Lebanon's border and crossing points. A1 Israeli warplanes hit civilians escaping by vehicle from their villages in southern Lebanon at least six times in a series of fierce bombardments, witnesses and officials said. Lebanese Red Cross ambulance drivers complained about narrowly avoiding Israeli fire as they cleared out the wounded, and a Lebanese photographer was killed when an Israeli missile struck near her car. A1 Saudis Urge Cease-Fire A delegation from Saudi Arabia asked President Bush to push for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and the terrorist group Hezbollah. The foreign minister said he delivered a letter from the Saudi king, Abdullah, with suggestions for ending the violence. It met a cool reception from American Officials. A8 Syrian Calls U.S. Course Faulty The Bush administration's approach of indirectly pressuring Syria to drop support for Hezbollah is doomed to failure, said Bthaina Shaaban a top Syrian minister. Washington, she says, is ignoring reality if it thinks groups like Hezbollah and Hamas can be purged by allowing Israel to bomb at will. A9 Recruitment Troubles in Iraq Recruiting a new police force to battle the insurgents in Iraq has become a central element in the United States' plan to reduce American forces. American commanders face securing a modicum of cooperation from a wary population, and to contend with a campaign by insurgents to assassinate and intimidate the members of Iraq's fledgling security services. A10 Saddam Hussein was hospitalized after a hunger strike, and was being fed with a tube and given tests to ensure that he could continue to attend his trial, Iraqi and American officials said. Widespread sectarian violence returned after two days of relative calm, with at least 57 people killed in bombings in Baghdad and Kirkuk. A11 Artist Shadowed by Nazi Ties After years of obscurity, the first publicly financed exhibit since World War II of the work of Arno Breker, the German sculptor whose art so vividly expressed Nazi ideology that he became known as ''Hitler's favorite sculptor,'' is being mounted in Schwerin, Germany. The exhibit has ignited a debate in a region which has had a spurt of far-right and neo-Nazi political activity recently. A3 NATIONAL A12-15 U.S. to Limit Payments For Victims of Disaster The Department of Homeland Security, responding to months of criticism and ridicule, will sharply cut back on emergency cash assistance for victims of major disasters, and more carefully control access to free hotel rooms. Immediate emergency aid would not exceed $500 in cash instead of $2,000 per family under the new rules. A1 Bar Association Critical of Bush The American Bar Association said President Bush was flouting the Constitution and undermining the rule of law by claiming the power to disregard selected provisions of bills that he signed. In a comprehensive report, a bipartisan panel of the bar association said Mr. Bush had used such ''signing statements'' far more than his predecessor. A12 Sunday Services in Parks From Memorial Day to Labor Day, 42 state, national and private parks in Pennsylvania hold nondenominational Christian worship services. The chaplains come from local towns and faraway states, as do the worshipers, mostly Protestants. Last year, 18,000 people attended services in Pennsylvania parks. A13 Elderly Katrina Victims Struggle Thousands of elderly Hurricane Katrina evacuees still struggle to get by in cities hundreds of miles from their home in New Orleans. But more than most evacuees, it is the elderly who want most to return, say social service workers, and who have the hardest time doing so. A12 F.D.A. to Limit Industry Ties The Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce an effort to write guidelines detailing the kind of industry ties that are permitted for those who serve on its powerful advisory boards. The agency hopes to appease critics who have complained that board members often have such deep financial ties to drug makers that their advice is tainted. A13 SCIENCE/HEALTH Stomach Surgery Called Risky Four of every 10 patients who undergo weight-loss surgery develop complications within six months, the federal government said. The number of such surgical procedures has been rising rapidly, along with the incidence of obesity, which now afflicts 30 percent of adults in the United States, health officials said.

A1 Last Fishing Shop Moves Capitol Fishing and Tackle, the last bait and tackle shop in Manhattan, is leaving the Chelsea Hotel, where it has resided for more than four decades. B1 Campaign Draws Big Names With their race quickly becoming a national symbol of rifts in the Democratic party, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman and his challenger, Ned Lamont, are turning to national political stars to help bolster each of their campaigns, apparently hoping that the big names can help turn out votes in the coming primary for the Senate. B1 SPORTSMONDAY D1-8 Tiger Woods Wins British Open Tiger Woods shot five-under-par 67 at the 135th British Open to win the 11th professional major championship of his career.
