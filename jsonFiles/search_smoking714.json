The man she wants to marry is in the room getting news of her betrayals. We see her extract -- from her bra, it appears -- a pack of Marlboros. Hesitantly, shakily, she lights a cigarette. The viewer is supposed to see the cigarette and her nervous smoking as a visible counterpart to the panicky feelings of imminent loss that are sweeping over her. She's about to explode, and this cigarette, as it often is in films, is a fuse. Utterly desolate, out in the cold, Ms. Roberts never looked more appealing, huddled around a brief flame and warming cinder, smoke streaming glamorously from her nose. Smoking, once again, is hot in the entertainment media. Half the movies released between 1990 and 1995 featured a major character who chose to light up on screen, a significant increase compared with 29 percent in the 1970's, according to a recent study at the University of California, San Francisco. And the trend appears to be accelerating. In her syndicated column earlier this month, Hillary Rodham Clinton noted that 77 percent of all films last year had scenes depicting smoking, as did every film nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards. She went on to denounce films that ''equate smoking with status, power, confidence and glamour.'' Mrs. Clinton cites these facts in order to blame Hollywood for an increase in teen-age smoking, ''despite,'' she says, ''the best efforts of parents and teachers to educate children about the dangerous effects of tobacco.''", "snippet": "TOWARD THE END OF THIS SUMMER'S hit film comedy ''My Best Friend's Wedding,'' Julia Roberts is hunched on the floor of a hotel hallway, her back propped against the door.
