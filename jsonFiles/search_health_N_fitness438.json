In a series of experiments involving bilingual college students, the researchers discovered that one circuit gives names to numbers and carries out exact calculations. A second circuit operates intuitively and is used for estimating quantities and other numerical relationships. During human evolution, they suggest, these two brain areas combined forces and gave rise to the remarkable human capacity for manipulating numbers arithmetically. Their interaction may also underlie many kinds of advanced mathematics.", "headline": {"main": "Brain's Math Machine Traced to 2 Circuits"}, "abstract": "Coalition of environmental and health-care groups urges pregnant women to avoid canned tuna fish entirely and advises mothers of preschool children to serve them no more than one tuna salad sandwich a week; cite mercury levels in samples of canned tuna they tested (M)", "print_page": "9", "word_count": 997, "_id": "4fd1fbe08eb7c8105d75aa45", "snippet": "The ability to do mathematics -- everything from simple arithmetic to thinking up equations that explain an expanding universe -- may stem from the interaction of two brain circuits that handle numbers differently, two scientists have found.
