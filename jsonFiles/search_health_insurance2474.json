A1 Mr. Woodruff was in Baghdad for ABC reporting the good news that the Bush administration complains is ignored by the news media, and he ended up as a glaring illustration of the bad news. A12 Iran Leader Uses Popular Issue Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an ultra-conservative former militia member, has used Western opposition to Iran's nuclear program to generate national unity and purpose, compelling even people who oppose him to give him room to maneuver. A1 Iran has given inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency access to a razed military site but has failed to meet other demands under its international treaty obligations. This concession seemed intended to erode support for a drive to send Iran's case for judgment by the United Nations Security Council. A10 Palestinian Ire Underestimated Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice acknowledged that the United States had failed to understand the depth of hostility among Palestinians toward their longtime leaders, leading to an election victory by the militant group Hamas that has reduced to tatters crucial assumptions underlying American policies and hopes in the Middle East. A1 The Islamic militant group Hamas is poised to come to power and gunmen from the rival Fatah movement are strutting in the streets, yet it is not clear who will have effective control over the most heavily armed Palestinian group: the security forces. A6 Polish Rescuers Call Off Search Rescue workers finished searching the wreckage of a football-field-size convention center in Katowice, a city in southern Poland, finding the bodies of 66 people who died when a snow-laden roof collapsed during the final hour of an international pigeon fanciers' fair. A4 Hussein Trial Disrupted The trial of Saddam Hussein erupted into chaos, with the new chief judge ordering all four lead defendants removed from the courtroom, one of them kicking and screaming, and with the entire defense team walking out in protest. The defendants may now be tried in absentia. A13 Antiwar Figure Meets Ch\u00e1vez With Cindy Sheehan, the antiwar campaigner, by his side in Caracas, Venezuela, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez said she planned to protest again outside President Bush's ranch in Texas. A13 Georgia Gas Lines Repaired Russia completed repairs to a natural gas pipeline carrying fuel over its border in the Caucasus, beginning to restore fuel to Georgia after a week of blackouts and heating fuel shortages strained relations between the two countries. A4 NATIONAL A14-20 Effort to Shift Balance On Court Bears Fruit For the conservative legal movement, nurtured by the Federalist Society and the Reagan administration, Judge Alito's almost-certain confirmation to the Supreme Court is a triumph 25 years in the making. Conservatives hope they have shifted the balance of the Supreme Court in their direction on matters from abortion rights to school prayer. A1 Enron Judge to Select Jury Judge Simeon T. Lake III, who will begin the much-anticipated criminal trial of the former Enron chief executives, said in court that he expected to choose a panel of 12 jurors and 4 alternates from the remaining 100 prospective members in one day. The defense lawyers say they are deeply troubled by the jury's responses to questionnaires. A1 Bill May Raise Health Costs The Congressional Budget Office predicts in a new report that under a Congressional bill, 13 million low-income people face new or higher co-payments for medical services like doctor's visits and hospital care, and some of them will forgo care or drop out of Medicaid because of the higher costs. A14 FEMA Help Unused The Interior Department offered trucks, boats, aircraft and thousands of law enforcement officers to help FEMA with the Hurricane Katrina rescue effort. But much of the equipment and personnel were not used as part of the federal response, or not used effectively. A14 G.O.P. to Choose New Leader House Republicans will choose a leader to replace Tom DeLay in a private election that holds major significance for their party's public image and the approaching mid-term elections. Roy Blunt of Missouri, John A. Boehner of Ohio and John Shadegg of Arizona are all seeking to lead the party in a crucial year. A16 Few Using Military Program Fewer than 70 service members have sought reimbursement for the cost of combat equipment they personally bought for use in Iraq and Afghanistan as part of a program that the Pentagon originally opposed. Pentagon officials contended that the reimbursement program would be a strain on its budget. A18 San Francisco Landmarks Trees San Francisco officials amended the city's Urban Forestry Ordinance to allow the landmarking of significant trees, including those on private property. The amendment, which takes effect in February, treats trees much like historic buildings, protecting them and making it a crime to chop them down. A14 State of a Crucial Speech After a bad year for his presidency -- when his competency was called into question, his main domestic initiative failed to pass and his foreign policy was challenged as never before -- President Bush's State of the Union address is vital to drive forward his policy agenda. Finding the words to accomplish that task falls in large part to a select few. A17 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Man Is Found Dead In Indonesian Consulate An Indonesian man stranded in New York for the weekend pending a flight home was found dead, a knife protruding from his chest and one hand nearly severed at the wrist, in a basement room of the Indonesian Consulate, the police said. B1 Police Officer Still in Danger An off-duty police officer who was shot by a colleague who mistook him for a criminal remained in critical condition. Several witnesses offered varying accounts of what sparked a fracas inside a Bronx restaurant just before the shooting. B1 Neediest Cases B6 SPORTSMONDAY D1-8 Success for U.S. Ski Team The United States ski team tied its own long-standing record, and demonstrated its depth going into the Turin Olympics, when it placed Scott Macartney on the podium at a World Cup super-G race in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. D4 ARTS E1-8 Memoir Becomes a Novel Martha Sherrill, daughter of the polling expert and software company founder Peter Sherrill, changed her plans to write a memoir of her father and instead is publishing a novel, ''The Ruins of California.'' The author's plans changed when she uncovered a secret about her father that she chose not to reveal.

E1 OBITUARIES A21 Arthur Bloom The original director of the CBS news program ''60 Minutes'' and the first recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award in News Direction from the Directors Guild of America, he was 63. A21 Beth Fallon A political reporter whose columns in the Daily News and the New York Post brought an irreverent eye to city life, she was 64. A21 BUSINESS DAY C1-10 Historic Change at Fed Alan Greenspan is scheduled to step down on Tuesday as the Federal Reserve's chairman and hand over the most powerful economic job in the world to Ben S. Bernanke, a former Fed governor and professor of economics at Princeton. C1 Laptops vs. Cellphones In the year since Nicholas Negroponte unveiled his prototype for a $100 laptop, he has found himself wrestling with Microsoft and the politics of software. Now, Microsoft executives have started discussing what they say is a less expensive alternative: turning a cellphone into a computer by connecting it to a television and a keyboard. C1 'Idol' Remains Strong Executives at Fox were hopeful that ''American Idol'' would continue to do well in its fifth season, but even they were surprised at just how high the numbers were for the first few shows, especially among 18-to-49-year old viewers.
