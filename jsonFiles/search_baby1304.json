Women did die from illegal abortion prior to Roe v.

That is simply untrue. Even in the first trimester a woman undergoing abortion risks hemorrhage, uterine perforation, infection, Rh sensitization and acute or chronic inflammatory conditions, and is adversely prepared for possible future pregnancy with greatly increased chances of miscarriage, permature birth, ectopic pregnancy and sterility.", "headline": {"main": "Safety, Legal Abortion Are Not Synonymous"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "27", "word_count": 1101, "_id": "4fd12ad38eb7c8105d5f3689", "snippet": "Susan Schneider's article ''Antiabortion Plan: Where Is Justice?''
