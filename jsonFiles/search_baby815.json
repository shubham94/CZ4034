She paces the length of Suite 122 of the Comfort Inn, which also doubles as her union office, wearing denim shorts, a vivid red T-shirt that says, \"Union, Yes!\" and a pair of floppy slippers decorated with neon-colored puppies. Exhaustion (or, perhaps, the slippers) has the unlikely effect of making her look even younger than her 23 years. She has slept for 9 hours during the past 48, and her meals today will be, in order, from McDonald's, Burger King and Pizza Hut. Marc Panepinto, who at the grizzled age of 30 is a union organizing old-timer and Bunuan's immediate boss, sits on the couch across from her, beneath a wall-size chart filled with hundreds of color-coded Post-It notes. He, too, could use some sleep. He knows, without looking, that the layers of notes show a vote that is too close to call, despite two months of nearly nonstop work to bring a union to Yazoo Industries. He worries that Bunuan (pronounced buh-NEW-in), 17 months out of college, is feeling the pressure of running her first campaign from start to finish. He worries that the company has something up its sleeve at the 11th hour. He worries that the sky is alarmingly blue, with no sign of clouds, a bad omen because he believes that rain brings good luck. He worries that there is something he is forgetting to worry about.", "headline": {"main": "Showdown at Yazoo Industries"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "27", "word_count": 8704, "_id": "4fd1d1ba8eb7c8105d70c56c", "snippet": "It is the day before the union vote at the auto parts plant in Yazoo City, Miss., and Joanne Bunuan, emblem of the last hope of the labor movement in the United States, looks tired.
