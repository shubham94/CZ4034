Viewers will be spared the spectacle, we are told, of three giant networks competing for the same huge audience pie with basically similar programs. With greatly increased channel capacities, cable may be more like radio, beaming its fare to special-interest audiences. The future spells programming variety, we are assured. Of course, there are a few skeptics who keep pointing out that the massive web of radio stations blanketing the nation has resulted, for the most part, in little more than a vehicle for transmitting various kinds of popular music. But the undaunted theorists march on. Outside of cable's all-news operations, one of the more ambitious efforts to provide a narrowly focused service was launched in mid-March by Hearst/ABC Video Services. The package is ''Daytime,'' which consists of four hours of programming daily, beginning at 1 in the afternoon, Monday through Friday. All 20 hours are devoted exclusively to women. A brochure explains that the company ''conducted extensive research to determine what women want to see on cable television.'' It adds, forcefully, that ''Daytime'' has been ''created exclusively to meet and respond to the needs and interests of women now.''", "snippet": "There are dozens of visionary theories floating around corporate boardrooms that pertain to the future of cable television, and one of the most popular involves the concept of ''narrowcasting.''
