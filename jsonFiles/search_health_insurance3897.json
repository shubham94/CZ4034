In their headlong rush to capture part of the huge Medicare market of 38 million Americans, many H.M.O.'s have made inaccurate financial projections and now realize they cannot provide comprehensive care at the cost they expected. Some 400,000 Medicare beneficiaries whose insurers are therefore cutting them loose will now have to find another H.M.O. or go into the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. Managed care has now become a fact of life for more than 80 percent of Americans covered by private insurance. But it is still quite new in the Government-funded Medicare world where only 17 percent of beneficiaries are enrolled in H.M.O.'s and the rest are still in fee-for-service Medicare. Industry shake-outs will probably continue as more of the Medicare population moves into managed care.", "headline": {"main": "Medicare H.M.O.'s"}, "abstract": "Editorial on moves by several big health maintenance organizations to end their Medicare coverage in counties where they are losing money; questions how long remaining plans will be able to offer prescription drug benefits and lower deductibles that attract elderly (M)d", "print_page": "14", "word_count": 529, "_id": "4fd216ad8eb7c8105d791701", "snippet": "The move by several big health maintenance organizations to end their Medicare coverage in counties where they are losing money should come as no surprise.
