Perhaps a routine checkup has revealed a deficiency, prompting the doctor to recommend an over-the-counter supplement or, in severe cases, large prescription doses to correct the problem. Often, though, the concern is bone health. Without vitamin D, the body cannot properly absorb calcium, and bones become fragile. At the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons last month, researchers reported that among 889 adult patients treated for a fracture at a Missouri trauma center, blood levels of vitamin D were ''insufficient'' in 78 percent and ''frankly deficient'' in 39 percent. The study group excluded those with known risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.", "snippet": "At least once a week, someone, usually a woman over 50, asks me about vitamin D.
