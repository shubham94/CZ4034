Dr. Atkins' ''New Diet Revolution,'' ''The South Beach Diet,'' ''The Zone'' and even ''The Idiot's Guide to Weight Loss'' teach readers that all carbohydrates are not alike and that the way to judge which are good and which are bad is by how fast they are digested. Carbohydrates with high glycemic index values -- potatoes, white rice, bagels and many breakfast cereals, for example -- are digested quickly, causing a rapid rise in blood sugar. Whole oats, apples, beans and other carbohydrates with low index values are digested more slowly. Choose low index carbohydrates over high, the books advise, and your blood sugar will hold steady. Theoretically, that keeps hunger at bay and makes it easier to lose weight.", "snippet": "Evidence in support of low-glycemic diets has lent new validity to age-old wisdom: a healthy diet includes vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains and nuts.", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "JENKINS, DAVID J", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "DIET AND NUTRITION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "WEIGHT", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "GLYCEMIC INDEX", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "METABOLISM", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "SUGAR", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "RESEARCH", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "FOOD", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "5", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": "1002", "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}, {"news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "document_type": "article", "_id": "4fd247ef8eb7c8105d7e3c3b", "headline": {"main": "Method to Turn Off Bad Genes Is Set for Tests on Human Eyes"}, "pub_date": "2004-09-14T00:00:00Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"original": "By ANDREW POLLACK", "person": [{"lastname": "POLLACK", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Andrew", "organization": "", "role": "reported"}]}, "abstract": "Medical researchers are harnessing naturally occurring phenomenon, RNA interference, to create treatments they hope will fight diseases by shutting down genetic process that prompts person's cells to produce disease-causing proteins; if medical trials are successful, they could potentially yield cornucopia of drugs designed to silence errant, disease-causing genes in body, or disarm invading virus by knocking out its genes; in first test, Dr Lawrence J Singerman is injecting RNAi, as it is known, into whites of eyes of half dozen elderly people who are at risk of blindness from age-related macular degeneration; while RNAi works well in laboratory, it may not work on humans; two other techniques once considered highly promising have not yielded any significant drugs despite years of effort; Singerman's experiment is sponsored by Acuity Pharmaceuticals, which received permission from Food and Drug Adm to conduct first human test of RNA interference; Sirna Therapeutics has appled to FDA for permission to begin trial of its own drug for macular degeneration; process described; diagrams (M)", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/14/business/14gene.html", "section_name": "Front Page; Health; Business", "lead_paragraph": "If all goes according to plan, about half a dozen elderly people at risk of blindness will visit Dr. Lawrence J.
