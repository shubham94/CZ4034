Recently, there has been an explosion of several excellent drugs to treat depression, migraine headaches, allergies, hypertension and stomach disorders. In each class of these drugs, several more or less equivalent versions have been introduced. The drugs are generally safe and effective. Since the drugs are inherently good, there is no reason celebrities should not be hired to promote a product, since the intent is simply to raise market share.
