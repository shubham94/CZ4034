The action ensured that virtually all of President Bush's tax cuts will be locked in place until after the next presidential election. [Page A1.] STOCKS FALL -- Stock prices fell sharply as investors worried that rising oil prices would quicken the pace of inflation and force policy makers to raise interest rates further. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.3 percent, to 1,305.92. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 1.2 percent, to 11,500.73, and the Nasdaq fell 2 percent, to 2,272.70. [C1.] MARKET REVIVAL IN CHINA -- After sinking to an eight-year low last year and being declared all but dead, the Chinese stock market has recently soared to a level more than 50 percent higher from a year ago. [C9.] WAL-MART SUPPLIER CONTROVERSY -- Wal-Mart, having helped start an advocacy group that trumpets the company's contributions to America, is quietly helping that organization recruit Wal-Mart's suppliers to join the public relations offensive -- a move that some vendors say puts improper pressure on them. [C1.] ORGANIC FOOD AND WAL-MART -- Starting this summer, there will be a lot more organic food on supermarket shelves, and it should cost a lot less. The reason is that Wal-Mart wants to sell more organic food -- and because of its size and clout, Wal-Mart usually gets what it wants. [A1] INHALER SHORTAGE -- A federally mandated shift to a more ozone-friendly version of hand-held inhalers for asthma attacks is creating spot shortages of the devices. [C1.] MERGER RESISTANCE IN EUROPE -- Few business executives are as determined to forge a single European market as Alessandro Profumo, the Italian banker who took over HVB, the German bank. For other European chief executives eager to expand across borders, Mr. Profumo's experience shows that building a pan-European enterprise requires luck, stamina, and a thick skin. [C1.] NEW TWIST IN TRADING CASE -- Federal prosecutors arrested Jason C. Smith and charged him with leaking secret information from grand jury proceedings to David Pajcin and Eugene Plotkin, two men previously accused of running an insider-trading ring that reaped $6.7 million in illegal profits in 2004 and 2005. [C1.] WARNING ON PAXIL -- GlaxoSmithKline has sent letters to doctors warning that its antidepressant drug Paxil appears to increase the risk of suicide attempts in young adults. [A26.] SUIT OVER AIDS DRUG -- Two patients' rights groups in India sued to stop Gilead Sciences, a California biopharmaceutical company, from patenting the AIDS drug Viread, which is available in India in a generic form. If the drug is patented, it will become too expensive for patients in developing countries, the groups argue. [A4.] BLACKBERRY IN CHINA -- Research In Motion said it would introduce its BlackBerry wireless service in China. But the announcement prompted questions about how the service would fit into the Chinese government's program of communications surveillance and censorship. [C3.] HEALTH BILL FAILS -- A small-business health insurance bill collapsed in the Senate as critics contended that the bill would strip away years of consumer protections. [A23.] PAY-FOR-PLAY SETTLEMENT -- The Universal Music Group has agreed to pay $12 million to settle accusations that executives paid radio programmers to play songs. [C3.] ONLINE SHORTS AS OFFICE WEAR -- Dress codes these days are as elastic as a bungee cord, expanding to accommodate all manner of once unthinkable workplace infractions. This year dress codes have stretched to encompass shorts, of all things. A report can be found at nytimes.com/fashion. INVESTOR TOOLS -- Information on all United States stock, plus bonds, mutual funds, commodities and foreign stocks, as well as analysis of industry sectors and stock indexes is at nytimes.com/business POGUE'S POSTS -- A blog on the latest in technology from the Times's David Pogue, with a new look is at nytimes.com/pogue.

Expedia Inc., the Internet travel agency, said first-quarter profit fell 51 percent on higher expenses and waning demand for vacation packages. Net income declined to $23.3 million from $48 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.8 percent to $493.9 million. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) Delta Air Lines Inc., the nation's third-largest carrier, said in a regulatory filing Thursday that it expected a first-quarter loss of $2.1 billion, almost all of it because of bankruptcy restructuring costs. Delta said in the filing that excluding the cost of restructuring, losses for the quarter would be $356 million.
