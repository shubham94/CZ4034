But the $10 billion merger is also a sign of the decline of this region's fortunes as a financial-employment center, as Chase and Chemical proceed with plans to cut $1.5 billion a year in expenses by eliminating 4,000 jobs and perhaps 100 bank branches in the metropolitan area alone. Mindful of the potential blow to the economy and consumers in New York City, executives at both banks have gone out of their way to offer assurances that they will try to ease the pain caused by the merger.

It would form an institution with $297 billion in assets, overtaking Citicorp. The combined bank would take the Chase name, although Chemical is the larger bank and is the dominant partner in the merger. Walter V. Shipley, the chairman and chief executive of Chemical, will keep those titles at the new company. [ Page A1. ] Some New Yorkers fear that the merger will accelerate a decline in service in neighborhoods like Harlem, Bedford- Stuyvesant and the South Bronx. [ A1. ] About 12,000 positions will be cut in the next three years, roughly a third of them in the New York area, the two banks said. [ D7. ] The deal has better-than-even odds of working out, many banking experts said, largely because Chemical merged successfully with Manufacturers Hanover in 1991. [ D6. ] National City to Buy Integra The National City Corporation of Cleveland has agreed to buy Integra Financial for $2.1 billion in stock in a deal that is to create a banking company with $50 billion in assets and bring an outside institution into the Pittsburgh area for the first time. Integra's stock jumped $5.25 a share, to $57.125. [ D5. ] In another bank deal, First Nationwide Bank has agreed to acquire San Francisco Federal Savings and Loan for $250 million. [ D5. ] Knight-Ridder to Acquire Lesher Knight-Ridder said it would acquire Lesher Communications for $360 million, expanding the newspaper chain's reach in the San Francisco suburbs. [ D2. ] Cardinal Health in Deal Cardinal Health, a distributor of health care products, said it would acquire Medicine Shoppe International, the largest franchiser of drugstores in the nation, for $348 million. The proposal surprised some analysts. [ D4. ] Stratus to Cut Work Force Stratus Computer said that it would dismiss 500 employees, or 18 percent of its work force, to reduce costs and that it would take a $20 million charge for the third quarter. [ D4. ] Judge Reverses Verdict on Patents A Federal judge has reversed a jury verdict that ordered three semiconductor companies to pay Texas Instruments $51.8 million in damages for patent infringement on a computer-chip-packaging technology. The judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Cypress Semiconductor, VLSI Technology and LSI Logic had infringed on two Texas Instruments patents. [ D4. ] First Data to Shed Part of Unit First Data has agreed to shed the sales and marketing operations of either Moneygram or Western Union as a condition for Federal clearance of its $6.7 billion acquisition of First Financial Management. [ D4. ] Employer-Preferred Health Plans A growing number of employers are offering health coverage that rewards people who use few or no medical services. The plans, which involve medical-savings accounts for employees, are finding friends on Capitol Hill, and supporters say that such coverage can slow spending on health care. [ A15. ] Japan to Close Cosmo Credit Japanese authorities announced details of a $2.7 billion plan to close Cosmo Credit, a Tokyo credit union, and repay its depositors. The plan is to include loans from the nation's central bank, the Tokyo city government and Japan's deposit-insurance agency.
