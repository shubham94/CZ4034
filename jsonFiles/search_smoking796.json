The evidence turned up in hair samples from newborns, suggesting long-term exposure to nicotine and other potentially harmful components of tobacco smoke, said a researcher, Dr. Gideon Koren, lead author of the study, which is published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Suggestions of Risk The study did not investigate whether the exposure affected the babies' health. But previous research suggests children of women exposed to secondhand smoke two to three hours a day while pregnant might have an increased risk of subtle problems with speech, language, intelligence and attention span.", "snippet": "FOR the first time, scientists have found chemical evidence that nicotine can reach a nonsmoking pregnant woman's fetus if she is routinely exposed to secondhand smoke.

But dozens of studies involving more than a million people have hailed such a drug. It is none other than ordinary aspirin, the standby for reducing pain, fever and inflammation. The findings of recent studies strongly suggest that an aspirin a day -- or at least every other day -- may be better than an apple at keeping the doctor away. Aspirin, these studies indicate, can reduce a person's chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke and of developing cancers of the colon and other digestive organs. It may also improve brain function in people with dementia who have suffered little strokes, ward off or reduce the severity of migraine headaches and help prevent hazardous high blood pressure in pregnant women. Also being studied are aspirin's possible roles in preventing cataracts and averting recurrences of gallstones.", "snippet": "\"CHEAP 100-Year-Old Household Drug Found to Fight Heart Attacks, Strokes, Cancer, Etc.\" sounds like a too-good-to-be-true headline.
