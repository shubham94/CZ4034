But now the state has abandoned that goal. 1 Cruise Industry Regulation A long inquiry by the Government discovered a fleet-wide conspiracy within Royal Caribbean Cruises to save millions of dollars by dumping oily waste into the ocean. A review of the criminal investigation and details of another dumping incident show the difficulty of policing the booming cruise industry. 1 Childhood Cancer Survivors Childhood cancer has been transformed from killer to curable disease.
