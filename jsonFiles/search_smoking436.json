More people have jobs and health insurance when an economy is growing. Fewer people skip visits to the doctor to save money or suffer the severe stress that comes with a layoff. So with job growth now stronger than it has been since 2000, the country can look forward to some vigorous years, it might seem. But that is not quite how the world works, some new research has found. In fact, a strong economy should probably come with a warning label. A one-percentage-point fall in the unemployment rate -- which is what has happened since the summer of 2003 -- leads to 12,000 deaths a year in the United States that might not otherwise have happened, according to Christopher J. Ruhm, an economist at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro.", "snippet": "A study by an economist at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, has found that good economic times can increase risks to health."}], "meta": {"offset": 0, "hits": 1, "time": 70}}}
