A leading expert on leeches and their modern medical uses (yes, there are some), Sawyer is opening the Medical Leech Museum next month in Charleston, S.C. The public never tires of leeches, the 54-year-old biologist says confidently. People may hate them, they may find them disgusting, but they never get bored. Question: Will people get a chance to be bitten by one? No, that would be stupid, Sawyer says. the wound would bleed for 10 hours. Fear not, though -- other thrills abound. Here's a look. Your Friend, the Leech: Sawyer's company, Biopharm, pioneered the primary modern use of leeches -- placed on a wound after reconstructive surgery, a leech secretes natural anticoagulants that help contain bleeding during the healing process. One typical display focuses on Guy Condelli, who was 5 years old in 1985 when a vicious dog tore off part of his ear. Sawyer's leeches helped set the reattachment. Along with gnarly photographs, a letter from Guy says it all: Thanks for helping my ear.", "snippet": "Roy Sawyer's new museum is revolting, and he couldn't be prouder.
