Yet when you come away from the movie (the director's 30th), which today opens the Film Society of Lincoln Center's monthlong survey of Mr. Wiseman's career and is to be shown on PBS next Friday, there is no escaping a sense that in many ways Belfast represents his passionately elegiac vision of an American community that works. It's not that there is anything especially glamorous about this blue-collar town of 6,000, beyond its picture-postcard landscape and streets lined with handsome clapboard houses. Although the movie has one scene of a high-school class and another of youthful skateboarders, most of the lives it examines are middle-aged and beyond. While some are obviously better off than others, there are no glaring class differences. The closest thing to a mansion on the hill is the large credit card company that is the town's chief employer.", "snippet": "To call ''Belfast, Maine,'' Frederick Wiseman's spellbinding documentary portrait of a small New England coastal town, a romantic movie might be overstating the mood evoked by this stately four-hour film, which bursts with glowing images of fall...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "BELFAST, MAINE (DOCUMENTARY FILM)", "name": "creative_works"}, {"value": "WISEMAN, FREDERICK", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "BELFAST (MAINE)", "name": "glocations"}, {"value": "PUBLIC BROADCASTING SERVICE", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "FILM SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "MOTION PICTURES", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "REVIEWS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "TELEVISION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "GEOGRAPHIC PROFILES", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "DOCUMENTARY FILMS AND PROGRAMS", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "17", "type_of_material": "Review", "word_count": 1016, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}, {"news_desk": "National Desk", "document_type": "article", "_id": "4fd1f2318eb7c8105d7499ad", "headline": {"main": "Noting Shortfalls, U.S. Renews Health Goals"}, "pub_date": "2000-01-26T00:00:00Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"original": "By STEVEN A.
