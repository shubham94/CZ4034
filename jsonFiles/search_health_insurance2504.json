The ad, a 30-second spot, is being shown on cable and network television in New York City, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo and Albany. Mr. King's campaign staff did not disclose how much is being spent for the commercials. PRODUCER -- Jay Rabinowitz, Surreal Communications. ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with Mr. King standing outdoors in a blazer and an open-collar shirt, with trees in the background. It then slowly zooms in on a black-and-white photograph of Mr. King at age 7, with his father, mother and younger brother. Mr. King then describes his concerns about the medical care provided to his father, who died of cancer in 1994. The ad continues with Mr. King in 2006, sitting and strolling while speaking with various people, in suburban-looking yards and on streets. It ends with Mr. King speaking into the camera. THE SCRIPT -- Mr. King narrates the ad, telling viewers: ''I'm Charlie King. I'm running for attorney general. And here's one reason why: My father was my hero. When he died from cancer, I wondered whether he received the best medical care possible. As attorney general, I'll fight to make sure medical decisions are made by you and your doctor, not by insurance companies that deny necessary treatment.'' The ad then returns to Mr. King among various New Yorkers as he says: ''You can help, too. Join my people's campaign and share with me your stories of insurance company abuse. Together we can make New York better.'' At that point, a man speaks in support of Mr. King, saying, ''We're with you, Charlie.'' At the conclusion, Mr. King looks into the camera and says, ''I'm Charlie King, running for attorney general.'' SCORECARD -- By emphasizing his family, specifically his father's death from cancer, Mr. King takes the safe route of focusing on medical care, an issue that his campaign staff suggests resonates with all New Yorkers. Mr. King's appeal to New York residents to call or write in with personal examples of health care claim denials are meant to tap into voter discontent over the health care system. In a six-candidate Democratic primary battle that has been dominated by Andrew M. Cuomo, the former housing secretary, and Mark Green, the former New York City public advocate, the King ads are intended to raise the candidate's visibility. Mr. King is hoping to heighten his recognition among the large number of voters undecided about the attorney general's race. JONATHAN P.
