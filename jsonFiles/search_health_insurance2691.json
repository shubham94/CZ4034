Ms. M\u00fcller, a fashion illustrator, followed the instructions diligently. She wanted to deliver her baby at home, with her partner, Martin Lasowitz, a freelance movie prop master, and Misha, her 6-year-old son from a previous relationship. Many cups of tea and a walk around Washington Square Park later, Ms. M\u00fcller was in labor. At 9 p.m. on a Friday, the doorman at Mr. Lasowitz's Greenwich Village apartment helped Joan Bryson, the midwife, carry her oxygen tank and small bag of tools -- scissors, suturing needles, clamps and a device for listening to the baby's heart -- to the second floor.", "headline": {"main": "Home Delivery Is Available; Midwives Keep Busy Despite a Decline in Births Outside Hospitals"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1356, "_id": "4fd284b68eb7c8105d853f97", "snippet": "Midwifes keep busy despite a decline in births outside of hospitals.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/02/nyregion/02births.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "imagepages/2005/06/02/nyregion/02births2.ready.html", "rank": "2", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupHeight2": "325", "MultimediaUrl2": "imagepages/2005/06/02/nyregion/02births2.ready.html", "MultimediaPopupWidth2": "250", "MultimediaType2": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"credit": "Midwives keep busy despite a decline in births outside of hospitals.", "url": "imagepages/2005/06/02/nyregion/02births.ready.html", "rank": "1", "height": 325, "caption": "Home Delivery Is Available", "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupHeight1": "325", "MultimediaType1": "Image", "MultimediaPopupWidth1": "250", "MultimediaUrl1": "imagepages/2005/06/02/nyregion/02births.ready.html", "MultimediaSummary1": "Midwives keep busy despite a decline in births outside of hospitals.", "MultimediaHeadline1": "Home Delivery Is Available"}, "type": "Image", "width": 250}, {"url": "imagepages/2005/06/02/nyregion/02births3.ready.html", "rank": "3", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupHeight3": "325", "MultimediaPopupWidth3": "250", "MultimediaUrl3": "imagepages/2005/06/02/nyregion/02births3.ready.html", "MultimediaType3": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "images/2005/06/02/nyregion/home.7575.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/06/02/nyregion/home.7575.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NURSING AND NURSES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BABIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Anemona", "rank": 1, "lastname": "HARTOCOLLIS"}], "original": "By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-06-02T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; New York and Region"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Dining In, Dining Out/Style Desk", "lead_paragraph": "CHERYL ROGOWSKI planted her seeds of change in the black soil of Orange County, N.Y., in 1994. Her parents, first-generation Polish-Americans, built the W. Rogowski Farm, starting in the 1950's. Like most farmers in the area, they dedicated their land to the wholesale onion business. ''We sold 500 tons of onions every year,'' Ms. Rogowski said, ''and never met any of the people who bought them.'' In 11 years, starting with a crop of chili peppers seeded in her bedroom and planted in a remote field, Ms. Rogowski has transformed Rogowski Farm, raising 250 varieties of produce and forming intimate connections to its customers and employees. For her innovations, she won a $500,000 ''genius award'' last year from the John D. and Catherine T.
