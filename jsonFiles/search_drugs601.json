You step into the lobby and automatically look around for a plaque, figuring that with its dark wood paneling and marble columns, this must be the onetime home of Rutherford B. Hayes or some other historical personage heavy with Victorian-era dignity. As it turns out, the structure, with its architectural signals of tradition and power, was built in 1996 for its tenant: the Family Research Council, the conservative public policy center. In the gift shop just off the lobby -- where you can buy research-council thermoses and paperweights and the latest titles by Peggy Noonan, Alan Keyes, John Ashcroft and Pat Buchanan -- sits one of Washington's most unusual museum displays. Moms and dads who are planning to take the kids to the nation's capital this summer for an infusion of American history might want to add it to their itinerary, since it carries the lesson up to the present and right into their own living rooms. Beneath a large wall-mounted plaque emblazoned with the group's slogan -- Defending Family, Faith and Freedom -- and flanking a rather ferocious-looking American eagle statue are two large, museum-quality glass cases. The one on the left contains a complete groom's outfit -- tux, tie, fluffy shirt -- and the one on the right holds a bridal gown and all the trimmings, right down to the dried bouquet. Color snapshots of happy wedding parties festoon both display cases, and the back wall of the bridal unit features verses from the book of Genesis, King James version:", "headline": {"main": "What's Their Real Problem With Gay Marriage?

Symptoms A wave of nausea swept over the elderly woman as she climbed the stairs of her daughter's home. She hadn't felt well since she left her own tidy studio apartment in Florida the day before. She lowered herself onto the stairs with a quiet moan; her face was pale, her coral pink lipstick faded. ''I'm so sorry, darling,'' she said as her daughter ran into the hallway, ''I threw up on your stairs.'' Embarrassed, she admitted that she hadn't been able to keep anything down since the morning before. She'd thought about not visiting, but at 93, how many more Christmases would she be able to spend with her daughter and grandchildren? ''I kept thinking it was going to go away, but it just hasn't,'' she explained. ''Mother, really!'' the younger woman chided gently as she helped her into her bed and briskly checked her blood pressure. It was high: 200 over 80 (normal is less than 120 over 80). She immediately called her mother's doctor in Florida, who told her to take her mother to the emergency room.", "headline": {"main": "* Vomiting; * Hypertension; * Lethargy", "kicker": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 6-19-05: DIAGNOSIS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "word_count": 1395, "_id": "4fd25c7d8eb7c8105d80a041", "snippet": "A 93-year-old patient, even a very capable one, can present unexpected difficulties.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/magazine/19DIAGNOSIS.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "imagepages/2005/06/16/magazine/19diag.1.html", "rank": "1", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupWidth1": "250", "MultimediaUrl1": "imagepages/2005/06/16/magazine/19diag.1.html", "MultimediaPopupHeight1": "325", "MultimediaType1": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "CANCER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AGED"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"qualifier": "M.D", "firstname": "Lisa", "lastname": "Sanders", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By Lisa Sanders, M.D"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-06-19T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 5, "offset": 0, "time": 26}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
