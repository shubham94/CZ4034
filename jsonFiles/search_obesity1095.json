Social scientists have yet to nail down the answer. But economists now have good reason to believe that blondes make more money -- or at least the trim, attractive ones do. New studies show that men and women (with any hair color) who are rated below average in attractiveness by survey interviewers typically earn 10 to 20 percent less than those rated above average. One is tempted to write off the results as proof that idle econometricians are the Devil's helpers. But the findings from Daniel Hamermesh of the University of Texas and Jeff Biddle of Michigan State are complemented by other research showing that obese women are also at a considerable earnings disadvantage. And they could figure prominently in the very serious business of deciding who is protected by the three-year-old Americans With Disabilities Act.", "snippet": "DO blondes have more fun?
