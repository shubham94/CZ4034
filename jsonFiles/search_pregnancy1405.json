Because the baby girl is remarkably happy and outgoing for an infant who was left abandoned in the woods, she melts the hearts of everyone who comes in contact with her. The foundling is the offspring of a traveling salesman and a naive local teenager he murders after she gives birth in the North Carolina backwoods. Accentuated by the twang of old-style country music, this story of seduction, murder and retribution is a potent blend of naturalism and myth.
