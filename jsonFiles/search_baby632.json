Now aging baby boomers, never quiet about anything, can spend as many years without functioning ovaries as with them. Menopause, circa 2001, is no longer a life passage. It is a medical event. Of all the symptoms of menopause, the hot flash is the most intriguing. A classic hot flash begins with an aura, a vague sensation in the face and neck that blossoms over a period of a minute or two, skin temperature rising, pulse quickening, into a full-blown wave of heat and blushing and drenching sweat, often followed by chills. Japanese women, mysteriously, report fewer hot flashes than Americans. Spicy foods and hot drinks trigger hot flashes in some women but not others. Some women flash only sporadically.
