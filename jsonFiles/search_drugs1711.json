This grim pronouncement by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, chief of the laboratory of immunoregulation at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was in a recent editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association. He was describing AIDS, for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a disease that cripples the most potent and pervasive of the body's bulwarks against attack - the immune system. AIDS does not seem to be an old, hitherto unnoticed malady, but it is not unprecedented. It stands among a class of disorders, though it is clearly among the most deadly and widespread. As with other immune deficiencies, the fatal effects of AIDS reflect weaknesses in the body's normal defenses, rather than the attack of a specific disease process. AIDS victims often die from overwhelming infection caused by microbes that would pose trivial problems to a person whose immune system is at full strength.", "headline": {"main": "A DEFENSE AGAINST NO SELF-DEFENSE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "word_count": 1351, "_id": "4fd12eb78eb7c8105d5fac40", "snippet": "''We are witnessing at the present time the evolution of a new disease process of unknown etiology with a mortality of at least 50 percent and possibly as high as 75 to 100 percent, and with a doubling of the number of patients afflicted every six...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/24/weekinreview/a-defense-against-no-self-defense.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "IMMUNIZATION AND IMMUNITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By HAROLD M.
