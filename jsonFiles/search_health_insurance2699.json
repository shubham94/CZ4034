Toyota is adding 300 more workers in Huntsville, Ala, to produce powerful engines for big pickup trucks that will be made in factory opening next year in Texas; quarter of all cars and trucks built in US are made in factories owned by foreign automakers producing foreign brands, up from 18 percent in 2000; assembly plants employ nearly 60,000 people, and that number continues to grow; union jobs at Big Three plants pay dollar or two more per hour--about $26 an hour compared with $24 or $25 an hour for nonunion jobs at foreign plants; compensation at American automakers swells to average of $55 an hour when health care, cost of living and other benefits are counted, compared with $48 an hour, on average, at Toyota; Toyota's plants operate at about 107 percent of manufacturing capacity, meaning that they are constantly running on overtime;
