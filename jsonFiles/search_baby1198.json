Lately, half a grapefruit or some other healthy food. ''I hate it,'' growls Welles, whose appetites remain undiminished. After a swim, Welles usually ''takes meetings'' with his regulars, among them, Prince Alessandro Tasca di Cuto, his production manager, who first worked with Welles in 1947 on ''Cagliostro.'' ''Oh, boy, is he a prince,'' says Welles of his colleague. ''He is a duke four times; he's a marquis six times; he's a count three or four times; he has the Order of the Golden Fleece twice, which gives him the right to converse with the King of Spain with his hat on.'' Tirelessly, and, so far, fruitlessly, Welles and the prince work together almost every day, revising and discussing budgets for film projects they hope will find funding here or abroad -''King Lear,'' to be acted in and directed by Welles; ''The Dreamers,'' Welles's adaptation of two Isak Dinesen stories; an original script entitled ''The Big Brass Ring.''", "headline": {"main": "ORSON WELLES: THE UNFULFILLED PROMISE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": 5915, "_id": "4fd143128eb7c8105d61c2fa", "snippet": "MOST MORNINGS, Orson Welles is awake before 6.
