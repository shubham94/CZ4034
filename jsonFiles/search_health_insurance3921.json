Throughout our history, members of Congress have appreciated the enormous gravity of impeachment, and that is why despite countless disputes, provocations, misdeeds and lies, the House has voted just once in its history to impeach a President. Indeed, the delicate system of constitutional checks and balances established by the founders works only insofar as each branch of Government exercises its prerogatives responsibly. In the case of impeachment, that means applying the most rigorous test to the use of our authority. The Constitution gives this body the ability to undo our only national election, but we must use that authority judiciously and cautiously.
