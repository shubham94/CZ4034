The new endeavor focuses on proteins, which are the substances made by the body in response to instructions provided by the genes. It is actually the proteins that form the body and carry out its functions, so they are in some sense of more direct relevance to medicine than the genes themselves.", "snippet": "Now that scientists have effectively determined the complete sequence of human DNA, research teams are gearing up for a follow-on project that many say will be every bit as ambitious and difficult -- but also full of promise for medical research.    ...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "HUMAN GENOME PROJECT", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "GENETICS AND HEREDITY", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "PROTEINS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "RESEARCH", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "1", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 2019, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
