And, for years, the question seemed almost unanswerable. Some thought it was a matter of timing. If a woman took thalidomide during the first three months of her pregnancy, when her baby's limbs were forming, the baby would be born with the flipper-like limbs that so unforgettably marked thalidomide children. If she took the drug later, the baby would be unaffected. It could just be the bad luck of exposing a fetus to a teratogen, or birth defect-inducing substance, at exactly the wrong time.", "headline": {"main": "Molecular Tools May Offer Clues To Reducing Risks of Birth Defects"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 1808, "_id": "4fd1cb298eb7c8105d7006e6", "snippet": "VIRTUALLY every scientist who has ever studied birth defects has been haunted by the same question: why are some babies born with devastating defects when their mothers have taken drugs like the sedative thalidomide or the acne drug Accutane or the...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/23/science/molecular-tools-may-offer-clues-to-reducing-risks-of-birth-defects.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BIRTH DEFECTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACCUTANE (DRUG)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GENETICS AND HEREDITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DILANTIN (DRUG)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THALIDOMIDE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOLIC ACID"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Gina", "lastname": "KOLATA"}], "original": "By GINA KOLATA"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1995-05-23T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Science; Health"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 27}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
