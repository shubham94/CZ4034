The point, made implicitly, is that since the number of young Army recruits who smoke is over twice that of young civilian male smokers, the Army has been promoting exposure of recruits to potentially lethal as well as serious debilitating physical illnesses. On the more cheerful side of the ledger though, males now appear to be less concerned about machismo than about health and are taking statistics about lethality and chronic illness in smokers to heart. They are quitting smoking at an encouraging rate. This is not, however, the case with young females, who begin smoking at an early age and continue to smoke at a far greater rate than previously, and as expected are increasingly suffering the lethal and debilitating effects of this habit.", "snippet": "To the Editor:   ''The Soldier's Enemy'' (editorial, June 13) is a cogent expression of a too infrequently addressed cause of the initial impulse to smoke for young males - i.e., ''a rite of passage as the first shave'' - an expression of macho..."}, {"word_count": 2148, "slideshow_credits": null, "multimedia": [], "news_desk": "Style Desk", "pub_date": "1986-06-23T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/23/style/breast-cancer-assessing-role-of-hormones.html", "blog": [], "_id": "4fd15f858eb7c8105d6488b3", "headline": {"main": "BREAST CANCER: ASSESSING ROLE OF HORMONES"}, "subsection_name": null, "abstract": null, "section_name": "Front Page; Health; Style", "byline": {"original": "By JANE E.

Based on early findings from new studies, some experts now predict that manipulation of a woman's hormones through diet and exercise or perhaps simple drug therapy may help to keep the disease at bay. The suggested changes involve following a low-fat or low-calorie diet throughout life and pursuing vigorous physical activity, especially during the teens and early adult years. Although a decade or more of research needs to be completed before the effectiveness of such measures is fully known, the investigators point out that good diet and exercise habits can only help, not hurt. At the least, they would reduce the risk of developing heart disease and obesity and its attendant health problems.", "snippet": "Breast cancer, a disease that will strike one in 11 American women, has in the last few years forced researchers back to square one in their efforts to understand its causes and develop methods of prevention.
