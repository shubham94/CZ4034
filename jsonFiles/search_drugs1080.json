The men studied, who ranged from middle-aged to elderly, had the same exposure to lead most Americans had in the last 40 or 50 years, said Dr. Howard Hu, a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health and a co-author of both studies. They were chosen because they were participants in a long-term study on aging conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs, giving researchers considerable data about their health. \"Few of them had occupational or untoward exposures,\" Dr. Hu said.
