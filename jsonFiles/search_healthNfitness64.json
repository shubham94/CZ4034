Ossur's Proprio Foot uses motion sensors, actuators and software to replace lost muscle function and keep track of where it is in space. Costing $12,000 to $18,000, the device automatically positions itself on stairs or steep ramps -- situations that can be difficult for an amputee. In initial fitting, a ''gait profile'' is created by having the wearer take 15 consecutive steps on level ground. The foot can be worn with or without shoes. FRANK O'CONNELL Adapting to its environment 1. Accelerometers sample the foot's position more than 1,000 times a second. A change in the gait signals that the person may no longer be on a level surface. 2. A motor drive pivots the heel up and down. 3. A sensor in the joint measures the foot's angle, ensuring that the foot is correctly positioned for the next step. Automated advantage Unlike previous artificial feet, the Proprio flexes automatically to the proper position, allowing for more natural walking. Different modes for special situations STAIR MODE Goes into action when the sensors detect two stairs in succession. It rotates the ankle to accommodate steps. RELAX MODE Allows wearer to sit more naturally by lowering toe toward the floor. CHAIR EXIT MODE By tapping the heel in relax mode, wearer flexes ankle forward so the foot can be pulled back. The heel provides shock absorption and allows a more natural walking motion. Its height can be adjusted up to 2 inches via a keypad to accommodate different shoe styles. Developments in prosthetic feet WOODEN LEG 1800's Peg leg for above-theknee amputees. SACH FOOT 1950's Solid ankle, cushion heel. Durable, inexpensive and lightweight. SEATTLE FOOT 1980's First energy-storing foot. Uses a lightweight plastic spring mechanism. FLEX FOOT 1980's First carbon fiber foot. Simulated the spring of a normal foot. COLLEGE PARK FOOT 1990 First to be produced with humanlike joint configuration, allowing ankle motion.
