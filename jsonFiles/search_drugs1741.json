The eggs can be found on tree trunks, fence posts, stone walls, garbage cans and house shingles. Professional entomologists are still out in forests and woodlands completing egg counts. Dr. John F. Anderson, the State Entomologist and the head of the Department of Entomology at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, said they had found a lot of egg masses east of the Connecticut River.", "headline": {"main": "GYPSY MOTHS HEAD EAST"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1452, "_id": "4fd120f78eb7c8105d5e2683", "snippet": "THE Connecticut River appears to be the dividing line for outbreaks of gypsy moth caterpillars this year.
