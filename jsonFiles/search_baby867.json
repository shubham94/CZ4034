However, two other new studies suggest that daughters who are breast-fed are less likely to develop breast cancer later in life. Dr. Louise Brinton, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute, analyzed data gathered from 2,477 women in three states, 1,211 of whom had received diagnoses of breast cancer from April 30, 1990, to Jan. 1, 1993. Most of the patients had developed their cancers before menopause. The women were interviewed in great detail about their reproductive histories, including the number of live births they had, how old they were when their first babies were born, how many of the babies they breast-fed and for how long, and when they started supplementing breast milk with formula.", "headline": {"main": "Data on Breast-Feeding"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "word_count": 436, "_id": "4fd1cb278eb7c8105d7005a1", "snippet": "THE patterns of breast-feeding typical among American women may do little to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer, a new study indicates.
