For now, the experimental treatment will be limited to patients with identical twins willing to donate bone marrow.

Based on early findings from new studies, some experts now predict that manipulation of a woman's hormones through diet and exercise or perhaps simple drug therapy may help to keep the disease at bay. The suggested changes involve following a low-fat or low-calorie diet throughout life and pursuing vigorous physical activity, especially during the teens and early adult years. Although a decade or more of research needs to be completed before the effectiveness of such measures is fully known, the investigators point out that good diet and exercise habits can only help, not hurt.
