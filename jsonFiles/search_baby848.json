But the lack of consensus probably will delay the date that Congress solves the entire Social Security problem. The members did agree to invest Social Security taxes in stocks and other private securities, as well as the low-yield government bonds that are the only existing investment option. That change will make Social Security a better deal for workers. But the impact on the overall economy will be minor. The Social Security Trust Fund would substitute stocks for some of the bonds it used to buy from the Treasury. But the Treasury will then have to sell more of its bonds to private investors.
