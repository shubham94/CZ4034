Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay, is leading Steve Poizner, the state's insurance commissioner, in a new poll by just nine points. As recently as March, her lead was 50 points. Ms. Whitman, who is a billionaire, has spent $68 million of her own fortune on the campaign, while Mr. Poizner has spent $24 million of his. If the election was held today, Attorney General Jerry Brown, the Democratic candidate who has spent no money on ads, would beat both Republicans, according to the same poll by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. The survey also found that Californians were evenly divided on legalizing marijuana.\u00a0[The San Francisco Chronicle, The Oakland Tribune]", "headline": {"main": "Sampler: Whitman's Lead Over Poizner Shrinks, and Rooting Roosters Out of Danville", "kicker": "Bay Area"}, "abstract": "A selection of stories of interest to residents of the Bay Area.", "print_page": null, "word_count": 794, "_id": "4fd39aff8eb7c8105d8d8fbd", "snippet": "A selection of stories of interest to residents of the Bay Area.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/20/sampler-whitmans-lead-over-poizner-shrinks-and-rooting-roosters-out-of-danville/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Katharine", "lastname": "MIESZKOWSKI"}], "original": "By KATHARINE MIESZKOWSKI"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2010-05-20T08:07:24Z", "section_name": "U.S."}, {"type_of_material": "Op-Ed", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Editorial", "lead_paragraph": "One of the largest gatherings of Vietnam War veterans is scheduled to take place in Wisconsin next week as a tribute to the service and suffering of American troops.", "headline": {"seo": "An Overdue \u2018Welcome Home\u2019", "main": "An Overdue \u2018Welcome Home\u2019", "print_headline": "An Overdue \u2018Welcome Home\u2019", "content_kicker": "Op-Ed Columnist"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "19", "word_count": "774", "_id": "54463ba5798810347c1a9555", "snippet": "One of the largest gatherings of Vietnam War veterans is scheduled to take place in Wisconsin next week as a tribute to the service and suffering of American troops.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/opinion/15herbert.html", "multimedia": [{"subtype": "thumbnail", "url": "images/2006/04/02/opinion/ts-herbert-75.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2006/04/02/opinion/ts-herbert-75.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "Vietnam War", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Veterans", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Wisconsin", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "glocations"}, {"value": "Documentary Films and Programs", "is_major": "N", "rank": "5", "name": "subject"}], "byline": {"contributor": "", "person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Bob", "lastname": "HERBERT"}], "original": "By BOB HERBERT"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2010-05-15T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}], "meta": {"hits": 2, "offset": 0, "time": 36}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
