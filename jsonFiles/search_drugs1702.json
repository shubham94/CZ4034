NEARLY a century after some leading physicians first recognized the powerful role of the mind in health and healing, scientists have begun to decipher exactly how stress and other emotional states can influence the onset and course of disease. Aided by new biochemical techniques and a vastly expanded understanding of immunology and neurochemistry, their studies show that emotions, acting through the brain, can affect nervous system function, hormone levels and immunological responses, thereby changing a person's susceptibility to a host of organic ills. Depending on the circumstances, animal and human studies have revealed that emotional reactions can suppress or stimulate diseasefighting whiteblood cells and trigger the release of adrenal gland hormones and neurotransmitters, including endorphins, that in turn affect dozens of body processes.", "headline": {"main": "EMOTIONS FOUND TO INFLUENCE NEARLY EVERY HUMAN AILMENT"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1770, "_id": "4fd12d2e8eb7c8105d5f7ea5", "snippet": "The care of tuberculosis depends more on what the patient has in his head than what he has in his chest.  - Sir William Osler (1849-1919), the father of modern medicine.
