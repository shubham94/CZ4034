Congress must ensure that the version that ultimately emerges sticks close to the Senate's proposal rather than the weak alternative adopted in early August by the House. The Senate version provides a floor of rights that states can build upon if they desire. The House version, by contrast, sets a ceiling on patients' rights that states cannot exceed and pre-empts the ability of states to set their own standards. That was one of the ill-advised provisions of the deal struck at the 11th hour by President Bush and Representative Charlie Norwood, the longtime champion of H.M.O. reform, who seems belatedly to have realized that he was snookered by the White House.
