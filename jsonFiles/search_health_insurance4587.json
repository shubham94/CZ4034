A1 ZAIRE'S BATTLING LEADERS The President and the Prime Minister of Zaire both say they have the authority to rule the large, impoverished African nation. Their battle for control has paralyzed the Government and cast doubt about its future stability. A3 EVACUATION OF BOSNIAN MUSLIMS The Bosnian Serbs' military commander agreed to allow a limited evacuation of Muslims from isolated areas of eastern Bosnia, United Nations and Serbian officials said. A6 VIOLENCE AGAINST SERBS Some of the Serbs who remained in Gorazde after Serbian \"ethnic cleansing\" got under way in eastern Bosnia have been put to death as suspected snipers. A6 News analysis: The obstacles to finding peace in Bosnia. A7 DEBATE OVER MIDEAST AID MONEY The Clinton Administration was forced by an influential Democrat in Congress to confront the delicate subject of whether the United States can afford to pour billions of dollars into Israel and Egypt. A9 ISRAELI SETTLER SLAIN IN GAZA Palestinian laborers stabbed an Israeli to death in a Jewish settlement, hours after the army opened the Gaza Strip after six days, the Israeli military said.
