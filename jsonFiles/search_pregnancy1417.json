All she had to do was choose a line of evasion, from pregnancy (too extreme) to what many morbidly call the Anorexia Out (underweight is unfit). Almost no one from her artsy high school planned to register, either. They understood that if they didn't want the army, the army, oversubscribed with teen-agers because of recent immigration, probably didn't want them. From the ultrasecular, nose-ring set to ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students, avoiding conscription has become a very serious social game for several circles of Israeli teen-agers. Including Israeli Arabs, who are not required to serve, about 45 percent of 18-year-olds don't enlist in the army -- the institution that is supposed to be the great democratizer and equalizer of Israeli life. Dodging military service is far easier for the 35 percent of Jewish girls who opt out than for the 20 percent of Jewish boys who do. In the past, girls had to get married, have babies or, unofficially, prove they had had two abortions. Religious girls could select national service instead.

Lately the pith of that jingle has found new fodder and new fans, through the explosive growth of a field known as evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary psychology professes to have discovered the fundamental modules of human nature, most notably the essential nature of man and of woman. It makes sense to be curious about the evolutionary roots of human behavior. It's reasonable to try to understand our impulses and actions by applying Darwinian logic to the problem. We're animals. We're not above the rude little prods and jests of natural and sexual selection. But evolutionary psychology as it has been disseminated across mainstream consciousness is a cranky and despotic Cyclops, its single eye glaring through an overwhelmingly masculinist lens.
