At latest count, the Federal Government was conducting or sponsoring more than 50 studies related to Agent Orange, ranging from very large health examinations of thousands of veterans to small tests of how the chemicals affect laboratory animals, at a cost that will exceed $100 million. Several important studies are due to announce initial findings by the end of 1983. But whether any of these studies will resolve the acrimonious and emotional debate over Agent Orange is problematic. Few scientists expect the studies to produce unequivocal results or provide a clear guide to public policy. It is gradually becoming clear that there is a vast gulf between the expectations of veterans who believe they were harmed by the herbicide and the informed judgments of many scientists charged with investigating their complaints.", "headline": {"main": "AGENT ORANGE: DESPITE SPATE OF STUDIES, SLIM HOPE FOR ANSWERS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1824, "_id": "4fd1244d8eb7c8105d5e950e", "snippet": "WASHINGTON SCIENTISTS are moving far faster than is widely recogized to investigate the riddle of Agent Orange, a herbicide that was sprayed over perhaps 20 percent of South Vietnam to defoliate trees and kill crops, and is now blamed by many...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/30/science/agent-orange-despite-spate-of-studies-slim-hope-for-answers.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "DEFOLIANTS AND HERBICIDES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HAZARDOUS MATERIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "VETERANS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By PHILIP M.

Supporters predict that the changes, established by a new law, will increase efficiency, eliminate waste and lead to the development of new cost-cutting concepts by hospitals, physicians, dentists and others who provide medical care. Organized medicine and some hospital administrators, however, say competition will lead to second-rate care for the indigent. The California plan is one of several innovative approaches proposed in the West, though it differs sharply from a competitivebidding proposal embraced this fall by the Reagan Administration in an effort to control costs of the Medicare program, which provides for the aged.
