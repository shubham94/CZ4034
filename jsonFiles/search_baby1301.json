Ten years later a second medical team came here for a look and concluded that although the diet of America's poor would still displease nutritionists, there was food in the icebox. The doctors agreed that in the decade that had passed, the corner would not have been turned without huge increases in the budget for Federal food aid programs. Since 1967, the budget for such programs has risen about 3,000 percent, from $585.5 million to about $16 billion. However, in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, the programs will be cut by $3 billion, a move that would, among other things, disqualify one million of the 23 million Americans now receiving food stamps and reduce the amount of food stamps for the remaining recipients by about 10 percent. The cuts were proposed by President Reagan and approved by Congress as part of their effort to hold down Federal spending with an eye to improving the national economy and, by extension, the lot of all Americans. But critics contend that the result will be increased hunger and malnutrition.", "headline": {"main": "FOOD PROGRAM'S ADVOCATES FEAR CUTBACKS WILL WIPE OUT GAINS IN NUTRITION"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "16", "word_count": 2471, "_id": "4fd118138eb7c8105d5cfe94", "snippet": "In 1967, six pediatricians were dispatched to the South on a search for hunger, and they found it in appalling quantity.
