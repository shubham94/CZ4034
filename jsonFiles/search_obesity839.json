According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, Latino children suffer from a disproportionate number of health problems that have been poorly studied. Diabetes is on the rise, and Latino boys have the highest rates of obesity among young people, but researchers don't know why. They also don't know why Puerto Rican children have rates of asthma higher than those in any other region. Many of the statistics pose mysteries that go beyond the fact that Hispanic children are less likely to be covered by health insurance than are children in other ethnic groups. For instance, Latino children who are hospitalized with limb fractures receive less pain medication than do white or African-American youths. No one seems to know why, and data is hard to collect because Hispanic children are often included in the categories of white, black or ''other'' in medical research. Many researchers also ignore these children and their parents by excluding non-English-speakers from their studies.", "snippet": "One in every six American children is Hispanic, but it's hard to find them in the research on child health.
