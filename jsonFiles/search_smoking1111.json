That is a question that has been raised with increasing frequency as doctors, ethicists and the public have become aware that the highly publicized artificial heart technology, which may some day play a major role in American medicine, is currently causing adverse reactions in most recipients. The problems have spawned a variety of opinions on the appropriate role for the artificial heart in its current early state of development. Experts have clashed over whether the artificial heart can most effectively be used as a permanent implant in selected patients, or as a temporary ''bridge'' to keep patients alive while they await a human heart, or for both purposes, or neither. The most vigorous proponents of the artificial heart believe it can save lives that would otherwise be lost when used as either a permanent or temporary implant. The most vigorous critics of the technology believe that a permanent implant is dangerous and that even temporary implants will do more overall harm than good to the public health.", "snippet": "Has the artificial heart caused such severe medical complications that it should be used only as a temporary device to keep patients alive until a human heart transplant can be arranged?

In addition, many American and Indian medical experts say that increasing clinical evidence compiled since the accident shows that the more than 2,000 deaths and 200,000 injuries were not caused solely by the leak of the chemical, methyl isocyanate, a pesticide ingredient. Instead, they asserted, some methyl isocyanate broke down into hydrogen cyanide, a poison used in the Nazi gas chambers during World War II, before toxic material escaped from a storage tank the night of Dec. 2-3. The Union Carbide Corporation has repeatedly asserted that, based on its own evidence and information, cyanide was not involved in the accident. Partly as a result, Indian officials have said, a cyanide antidote was not used to help victims until several months later. The issue has become the major medical controversy, Indian and American medical experts say.", "snippet": "Medical studies conducted in the year since the chemical leak at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, indicate that the chemical responsible for the accident causes serious long-term health problems that were unknown before the disaster.

A door opens and in walks a pensive-looking man. All conversation stops. There is, in the way the man moves and talks, the distinct air of someone in charge. He calls out greetings.
