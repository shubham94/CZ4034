Until 1980, at least nine large pharmaceutical companies were carrying on significant research into contraceptive development. Now there is only one, the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, which makes a variety of birth-control devices. This month the F.D.A. is expected to approve what would be the first substantially new contraceptive brought out in the United States in 25 years. Known as Norplant, it is a long-term hormonal device that would be implanted under a woman's skin. Norplant was developed by a small nonprofit group concerned with population problems and issues, the New York-based Population Council. Perhaps more remarkable than the promise of Norplant as a socially useful drug is that no American pharmaceutical company seemed willing to research and develop it. The Population Council spent 24 years, on and off, raising money and doing research in its own labs, before it finally brought Norplant to the Government for approval.", "headline": {"main": "Birth Control Backlash"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "41", "word_count": 4089, "_id": "4fd1a7128eb7c8105d6c1506", "snippet": "IN THE 30 YEARS SINCE THE CONTRACEPTIVE pill was introduced in the United States, this country has fallen farther and farther behind Europe in the birth-control choices available.
