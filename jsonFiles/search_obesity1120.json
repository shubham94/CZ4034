To facilitate the diagnosis and study of this syndrome, an international committee of medical experts has released a refined and much-simplified definition of the condition, which has been variously attributed to everything from emotional disorders and stress to chronic viral infection and a malfunctioning immune system. The new definition is expected to help both researchers and clinicians separate chronic fatigue syndrome from a host of other conditions that can cause prolonged fatigue and that would require more specific therapy. These other conditions include multiple sclerosis, cancer, sleep disorders, obesity, substance abuse and suicidal tendencies.", "snippet": "IF there has been one characteristic consistently associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, it is controversy -- over its definition, its magnitude, its cause, its treatment, even its existence.
