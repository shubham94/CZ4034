{"status": "OK", "response": {"docs": [{"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Cultural Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Rap and Peace and Love \"Although I don't believe in censorship, I believe an artist is very responsible for his actions,\" Al B. Sure said recently. \"Especially if he's a young artist whom young kids listen to, there's almost a sense of his being like the Bible. The kids listen to what he says and live by it. That's why I don't believe in negativity. Music can be an incredible vehicle for helping people, and I'm into peace and love.\" The 22-year-old singer, songwriter and producer was commenting on the current controversies surrounding rap lyrics. Along with Bobby Brown and Keith Sweat, he is one of a trio of young male pop-soul singers who, in the face of rap, are successfully perpetuating an older romantic pop-soul tradition. Mr. Sure's 1988 debut album, \"In Effect Mode\" (Warner Brothers) sold nearly two million copies. And its follow-up, \"Private Times . . . and the Whole Nine\" (Warner Brothers) is likely to do even better. Both records include remakes of 1970's pop hits. A high point of \"In Effect Mode\" was Mr. Sure's lush version of \"Killing Me Softly.\" The new album's opening cut is a rendition of the Eagles' \"Hotel California.\" Of the pop-soul trio Mr. Sure is probably the most conservative and musically sophisticated. His delivery of ballads is very similar in sound to Michael Jackson's at his most whispery and enraptured. Besides Mr. Jackson, the singers he most admires, he said, include Johnny Mathis, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway. The singer, who lives in northern New Jersey, was born in Boston, lived in Leonia, N.J., for several years, then moved to Goshen, N.Y., and went to high school in Mount Vernon, N.Y. It was while he was in high school that he and his cousin and co-producer, Kyle West, began making basement tapes. Shortly after signing with Warner Brothers Records three years ago, Mr. Sure won the Sony Innovator talent contest for promising black artists. One of the judges was the producer Quincy Jones, who has become something of a mentor. Mr. Sure has studied all of Mr. Jones's albums and has sung on two of them -- \"Back on the Block\" and \"Listen Up! The Lives of Quincy Jones.\" \"One of the most valuable things that I got from Quincy,\" he said, \"was that when you're producing a song, you don't tell the song what to do -- you let it tell you what it wants.\" Simon and Puritanism \"There's a lot of coming of age on the record and thinking about what's ahead,\" Carly Simon said the other day of the songs on her superb recent album, \"Have You Seen Me Lately?\" (Arista). \"It's probably a measure of being middle-aged and feeling a decaying process starting, but for someone who was brought up nonreligious, I find I have more questions and am trying to find answers more concentratedly than I've ever had to in my life.\" The new album's most overtly spiritual song, written by Ms. Simon with Teese Gohl, is a cheerful folk round whose lyric speculates on the possibility of reincarnation. \"Happy Birthday,\" another time-obsessed song, is a poignant acoustic ballad in which the 45-year-old singer and songwriter comments wryly on the Puritanism in today's health-obsessed social climate. At her own birthday celebration, the narrator of the song wistfully ticks off activities that have become risky or frowned upon over the last decade, from drinking to lying in the sun to casual sex. \"We're too good to be happy, too straight to be sad,\" she observes. The song ends as the singer tries to think of something to wish for that is not potentially harmful. Ms. Simon described \"Happy Birthday\" as \"a reflection on this age of denial we've entered.\" \"We can't drink or smoke or go in the ocean or have many of the pleasures we got so used to having in the 60's and 70's,\" she said. \"Nowadays, the only thing that's O.K. to do is to exercise at a feverish pace, and I hate to exercise.\" The album's most stunning moment is its title song, which will soon be released as single. \"Have You Seen Me Lately?\" was originally written to have been sung by Meryl Streep over the title credits of the movie \"Postcards From the Edge,\" but was dropped. In the final cut of the film, only instrumental fragments of the tune are heard recurrently in the background. One reason the song was not used, Ms. Simon said, was that Carrie Fisher, who adapted the screenplay from her own novel, felt it was too soft and emotional to fit the sensibility of the lead character. Another was that Mike Nichols, who directed the film, was unhappy with the front credits and decided to remove them, leaving no place for the song. \"The song is about shame, about hiding something and being very self-conscious about it and imagining everyone is noticing,\" Ms. Simon said. \"In the film, of course, that something was drugs. The two images that I pulled out that I thought were generic enough were dream images of being naked and dancing in a church choir and of being caught with one's hand in a cookie jar. It's a dreamy, insecure song.\" The Charts This week, for the first time, rap albums hold down the top two positions on Billboard's pop album chart. Also for the first time, a rap single has reached No. 1 on the pop singles chart. While M.C. Hammer's \"Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em\" (Capitol) remains No. 1 for the 21st week on the pop album chart, it is being seriously challenged by Vanilla Ice's \"To the Extreme\" ( SB K) which jumps from No. 5 to No. 2 in its seventh week on the chart. In those seven weeks, \"To the Extreme\" has now sold a phenomenal three million compared with Mr. Hammer's sales of over seven million copies in 35 weeks. At the same time, Vanilla Ice's single, \"Ice Ice Baby,\" becomes the first rap single to hit No. 1 on the pop singles chart. Mr. Hammer's album also becomes the first rap album to have three top-10 singles: \"U Can't Touch This,\" \"Have You Seen Her\" and \"Pray,\" which jumps from No. 12 to No. 6. Adding to the Hall of Fame The Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame has announced its new members, who will be inducted on Jan. 11. They include seven performers and groups: LaVern Baker, the Byrds, John Lee Hooker, the Impressions, Wilson Pickett, Jimmy Reed and Ike and Tina Turner. Two non-performers -- Ralph Bass, a producer, and Dave Bartholomew, a producer, writer and arranger -- will also be inducted, along with an early influence on rock, the blues singer Howlin' Wolf. The announcement was made by Ahmet Ertegun, chairman of the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame Foundation. To be eligible for the hall of fame, members must have released their first recordings at least 25 years ago. They are chosen by a panel of more than 300 performers, producers, writers, record-company executives and broadcasters. A ground-breaking date for the building in Cleveland that is to house the hall of fame and museum has not been announced, but the foundation says that $40 million has been raised for the project.", "headline": {"main": "The Pop Life"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "14", "word_count": 1211, "_id": "4fd1945b8eb7c8105d69f3db", "snippet": "Rap and Peace and Love   \"Although I don't believe in censorship, I believe an artist is very responsible for his actions,\" Al B.
