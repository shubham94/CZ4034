finds no evidence of any casual relationship between marijuana use and mental deterioration, insanity, violence or poverty; finds only med differences between smokers and, nonsmokers are circulatory and lung effects that could be attributed to tobacco; finds no definite evidence of mental illness, persistent loss of motivation or brain damage arising from marijuana use, but gives credence to evidence of effect on synthesis of DNA since marijuana can easily cross placental barrier of pregnant women; notes under certain circumstances use of marijuana can reduce levels of sex hormone testosterone; finds no evidence that marijuana users tend to become inured and turn to other drugs; notes marijuana is used mainly as 'energizer' by Jamaicans involved in heavy work, and that there was no indication that heavy marijuana use diminished work drive or work ethic; says many Jamaican workers performed better while under influence of drug; notes marijuana consumption by Jamaicans is 10 to 25 times higher than Amer counterpart and that Jamaican marijuana is more potent than that found in Mex or S Amer;
