The effort is aimed at blocking two non-binding resolutions directly critical of the troop increase. A1 Iran Linked to Attack on U.S. Investigators say attackers who used American-style uniforms and weapons to infiltrate a secure compound and kill five American soldiers in the holy city of Karbala on Jan. 20 may have been trained and financed by Iranian agents, American and Iraqi officials say. A10 More than 50 people were killed in sectarian violence, including a bomb attack on a Shiite mosque that killed at least 23, leaving another reminder of just how deeply the nation has been divided in the past year. A10 Official Defends U.S. Iran Policy John D. Negroponte, nominated as the next deputy secretary of state, defended the Bush administration's more confrontational policy with Iran during a Senate confirmation hearing that was peppered with demands from both sides of the aisle that the United States show restraint in its dealings with Tehran. A11 Fragile Cease-Fire in Gaza After five days of clashes in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian factions mostly observed the latest cease-fire, though one Hamas member was shot dead. Also, the Israeli Air Force bombed a tunnel it said Palestinian militants were digging to enter Israel and carry out an attack. A3 NATIONAL A12-17 Reporter Testifies At Cheney Aide's Trial Judith Miller, a former reporter for The New York Times, testified as a witness for the prosecutor who had put her in jail for 85 days, recounting details of her once-confidential interviews with I. Lewis Libby Jr. A1 West Virginia Blast Kills 4 An explosion at a store near a West Virginia ski resort killed four people and injured five. Investigators believe that the blast, which shattered windows nearly a mile away, occurred after propane gas seeped into the store and ignited. A12 A Return to The Times Dean Baquet will return to The New York Times as chief of its Washington bureau and an assistant managing editor. Mr. Baquet joined The New York Times in 1990, then left in 2000 to become managing editor of The Los Angeles Times, but he was fired in November for refusing to cut newsroom jobs. A13 Pell Grant Increase Proposed The maximum federal Pell grant for middle- and low-income students to attend college would rise, to $4,310, for the first time in four years under a spending bill that House and Senate Democrats agreed on. A14 SCIENCE/HEALTH New Plans for Drug Safety Top Food and Drug Administration officials announced a 30-point plan to ensure that drugs are as safe as advertised, including the first attempt to assess the safety of drugs 18 months after introduction. A17 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Death Sentence for Killer In Murder of Two Officers A federal jury in Brooklyn sentenced Ronell Wilson, 24, to death for killing two New York police detectives on Staten Island in 2003. Their decision marked the first successful federal capital punishment prosecution in New York in more than half a century. A1 M.T.A. Faces Budget Crisis The Metropolitan Transportation Authority faces surging costs that could jeopardize or delay renovations to subway and commuter train stations, maintenance of signal systems, and the purchase of hundreds of buses and subway cars. A1 BUSINESS DAY C1-14 Altria Ready to Spin Off Kraft Investors are reacting positively to a decision by Altria Group, the company once known as Philip Morris, to spin off its Kraft Foods division to shareholders and return to being primarily a tobacco company. A1 Nintendo Leads Competition The innovative Nintendo Wii has upset the order of the video game world. While Sony's PlayStation 3, seemed destined to be the most popular console, the Wii is winning many converts who do not fit the usual gamer stereotype. C1 Holocaust Insurance Trial Lawyers representing Holocaust victims decided to strike a deal with Assicurazioni Generali, an Italian company, to pay claims on life insurance policies sold to victims.
