Any level of obesity increases health risks, the panel noted, but it singled out a level of 20 percent or more above ''desirable'' body weight as the point at which doctors should treat an otherwise healthy adult. For those who have other health problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, or a family history of such problems, treatment of overweight should start sooner, the panel said. The 14-member panel, composed of health officials from a variety of disciplines, was convened by the National Institutes of Health to try to arrive at a consensus on current knowledge about the dangers to health of various levels of obesity. Treatment of overweight was not considered, although the panel urged that this question be the focus of a future panel.", "snippet": "Obesity is a killing disease that should receive the same medical attention as high blood pressure, smoking and other factors that cause serious illness and premature death, a Federal panel concluded here today.

Scientists in the United States and abroad are finding strong evidence linking some of the viruses in a family called papilloma with genital cancers, notably cancers of the cervix and vulva, and with an uncommon kind of skin cancer. The recent findings seem largely to eclipse earlier evidence linking genital cancers to herpes viruses. The virus called herpes simplex or herpes hominus type 2 has been under study for decades as a possible cause of genital cancers, but scientists say the evidence linking papilloma viruses with these cancers is now far stronger than the evidence relating to herpes. The new findings are expected to have an important impact on efforts to prevent and treat genital cancers, particularly in women. Many specialists believe that in time it should be possible to develop a vaccine against the types of papilloma virus that are under the greatest suspicion.", "snippet": "VIRUSES related to those that cause common warts are coming under increasing suspicion as factors in causing human cancer of the cervix and other types of malignancy.
