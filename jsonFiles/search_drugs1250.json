But drug experts said the change was likely to have little effect on the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. Brian E.

It intends to increase spending on training and equipment for countries that grow, refine and export illegal drugs to 16 percent, up by 5 percentage points.", "headline": {"main": "Pentagon Plans Shift in War on Drug Traffickers"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": 691, "_id": "4fd1bdbd8eb7c8105d6eac6d", "snippet": "The Defense Department announced a modest shift yesterday away from its ineffective and heavily criticized attempts at intercepting drugs to a greater emphasis on helping countries in Latin America attack the major drug trafficking organizations.
