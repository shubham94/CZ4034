Holthausen, the portly man behind the counter who dispenses the answers? Certainly not that for two decades he was a $1,000-a-week loan officer. Not that he survived three bank mergers only to be told, upon returning from a family vacation, that he no longer had a job. Not that his wife kicked him out and his children shunned him. Not that he slid to the bottom step of the economic ladder, pumping gas at a station owned by a former bank customer, being a guinea pig in a drug test and driving a car for a salesman who had lost his license for drunkenness. Not that, at 51, he makes do on $1,000 a month as a tourist guide, a quarter of his earlier salary. And not that he is worried that his modest job is itself fragile, and that he may have to work next as a clerk in a brother's liquor store.", "headline": {"main": "On the Battlefields of Business, Millions of Casualties"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 7112, "_id": "4fd1df5c8eb7c8105d724784", "snippet": "Drive along the asphalt river of Interstate 95 across the Rhode Island border and into the pristine confines of Connecticut.
