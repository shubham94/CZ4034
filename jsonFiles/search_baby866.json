It rose to the top of the fence, slipped down through the bare branches of the tree, dipped and ascended again, and finally halted where the kite had become ensnared in the fire escape of an adjoining building. Newkirk pulled; the kite wagged its tail. \"Oooh! Careful!\" cried several kids below. The students had built the kite in Newkirk's middle-school science class at the School for the Physical City, a new public school in its second year in Manhattan, and they didn't want to see their latest test model destroyed. Across the playground, kites of all shapes and sizes floated like clouds above the cement plain.

And, for years, the question seemed almost unanswerable. Some thought it was a matter of timing. If a woman took thalidomide during the first three months of her pregnancy, when her baby's limbs were forming, the baby would be born with the flipper-like limbs that so unforgettably marked thalidomide children. If she took the drug later, the baby would be unaffected.
