A relentlessly cheery voice interrupts your evening to doggedly hawk a new credit card, a long-distance carrier or, say, T-bone steaks delivered right to your door. Even if the consumer in you recoils from such pitches, the investor in you may want to take note. The telemarketing business is booming, and for the handful of companies that have gone public in the last year, the stocks are soaring. The stock of Apac Teleservices Inc., for example, has quintupled since it became publicly traded last fall. Even stock in Precision Response, which went public on one of the worst trading days this summer -- July 16 -- has almost doubled from its initial offering price. It doesn't take a marketing wizard to spot what is buoying the stocks. American companies now spend almost $80 billion a year on telemarketing chores -- almost triple what they did a decade ago -- and the growth continues at 10 percent a year. Most big companies, like AT&T and United Parcel Service, used to handle their own telemarketing. But with corporations shrinking, these chores are increasingly farmed out to some of the nation's 600 small, independent telemarketing companies, which say they have lower costs and more expertise. The practice, called outsourcing, now accounts for only about 5 percent of the telemarketing business, but that segment is growing 50 to 75 percent a year. The Sitel Corporation of Omaha became the first pure play for investors when it went public in June 1995. Through 37 major sites in North America and Europe, Sitel now serves more than 140 companies, mostly in insurance, financial services, telecommunications and publishing. While Sitel has been snapping up smaller telemarketing companies since 1992, four acquisitions announced this year have significantly increased the company's revenue and earnings prospects. For example, its pending merger with Mitre P.L.C., a European company, will give Sitel the broadest global representation in the industry, according to financial analysts. Maureen H. Pettirossi, a business and information services analyst at Dain Bosworth, said Sitel's earnings could grow 45 to 50 percent annually over the next two to three years. Of course, the potential for skyrocketing earnings does not come without risk. These stocks are best suited to investors comfortable with stratospheric price-to-earnings ratios, perhaps 50 times estimated 1997 earnings. Aggressive-growth stocks with numbers like that could tumble into the cellar if the stock market entered a prolonged slump. To get a fix on telemarketing stocks, investors may need to discard some of their assumptions about the industry. People outside the industry, Ms. Pettirossi said, tend to view it as relatively low tech -- ''a lot of people sitting around in rooms with phones'' -- as well as ''a little shady.'' In fact, she said, the newly public companies are technology intensive, operating sophisticated information systems that capture data efficiently and limit intrusive calls to consumers. The telemarketing industry is also broadening its base. In fact, many of the newly public companies prefer to be known as ''teleservice'' companies, because along with outbound calls for sales, they handle inbound calls, say for a catalogue company's ''800'' number. The inbound business is growing about twice as fast as the outbound segment, and it generally commands more sophisticated, long-term contracts. In this area, financial analysts recommend Teletech Holdings, Sykes Enterprises and Access Health. For now, the heady prospects for the entire teleservices industry are pulling up almost all the stocks of the newly public companies. To spot prospective leaders, Ms. Pettirossi and other analysts recommend companies that have both the technology and the ability to expand. ''The leaders in this business will have to be able to add capacity very quickly, which depends partly on financial ability and partly on management talent,'' she said. ''The trick here will be to maintain a high level of service at the same time.'' Ms. Pettirossi is now recommending Sitel, Apac and Precision Response. Of the three, Ms. Pettirossi said Precision Response, which her company helped bring to market, probably carried the most potential over the next year. She foresees earnings growth of 70 to 75 percent annually for the company over the next two to three years. T Lehman Brothers, Jeff Kessler, a business services analyst, sees Apac as the industry standard. ''We've been hard-pressed to find among other companies the mix or the level of technology that Apac has,'' Mr. Kessler said. Unlike many other teleservice companies, Apac handles most calls from a central site, which keeps operating costs low. He said that the company was ''superior'' in data base projects, had a relatively high percentage of inbound business (a bit over 40 percent) and offered sophisticated services like technical help desks for computer users. ''Our prediction is that Apac's share price can go to $50 in the next 12 to 15 months,'' Mr. Kessler said; it was $36 on Friday. ''Meanwhile, we think the company can grow its earnings 40 percent annually over the next three years.''", "headline": {"main": "You Hate When They Call, but Their Stocks Look Good", "kicker": "INVESTING IT"}, "abstract": "Telemarketing business is booming, and for the handful of companies that have gone public in the last year, stocks are soaring; leading the pack are Apac Teleservices Inc, Precision Response and Sitel Corp; chart (M)", "print_page": "4", "word_count": 848, "_id": "4fd1f2108eb7c8105d7493a5", "snippet": "THE phone call always seems to come just as you are sitting down to dinner or turning on your favorite TV show.

With a capital-gains tax cut, Jack Kemp vowed, ''Everyone can get rich'' (just as all the Lake Wobegon children are above average). He and Bob Dole had traveled to that tax-cut shrine called New Jersey, clearly hoping that a bit of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's magic dust -- it was, of course, on tax-cut wings that she flew from behind to victory a few years back -- would rub off. Yes, he told his audience, they could have it all: lower taxes, a balanced budget and stronger Social Security and Medicare. As for Democrats who say it won't add up, they're just trying to ''scare people,'' Mr. Dole said. But there were questions in the audience like ''How realistic is it?'' or ''Can he really come through?'' DEMOCRATS The Presidential Inkwell Bill Clinton, meanwhile, just couldn't stop signing things, wielding his tireless pen in an undisguised effort to prance into Chicago looking ever so Presidential. It was an odd mix, though: First came the minimum-wage bill, firmly in the liberal tradition of helping those at the bottom; then came a bill to expand access to health insurance, an inevitable reminder that this was a mere shadow of the revolution the Clintons had dreamed of, and finally the welfare bill, a scrapping of bedrock New Deal philosophy that outraged diehard liberals. It's a ''moment of shame,'' said Marion Wright Edelman, a children's advocate. ''This isn't welfare reform; it's welfare denial,'' said Senator Paul Simon of Illinois. And Bob Dole chimed in that the President ''is ideologically adrift.'' INSURANCE Is Lloyd's Lloyd's Again? Lloyd's of London. It still has a solid ring to it, doesn't it? It still evokes images of sober, whiskered gentlemen in top hats telling you in soothing, Gielgudian tones that all will be well. But all is not well, of course. The insurer is in an epic financial mess. Many people who've long pledged their assets to back its policies -- ''names,'' they're called (translation: rich people) -- seemed in danger of being wiped out by a flood of claims. But now, we're told, it has all been worked out. On Wednesday the ''names'' will pay modest sums to a new company called Equitas and rid themselves of dark visions of Dickensian ruin. And Equitas, magically, will be able to deal with those vast liabilities. Will it work? ''Our official position is that Equitas has plenty of money,'' one insider said. ''But our fingers are crossed.'' But a Dow Corning executive wanted nothing of stiff upper lips, calling the deal ''a giant international insurance shell game.'' LEAVING AT&T And It Isn't Even the N.B.A. For a business executive, the pinnacle, naturally, is to run a giant company. That's the big leagues, the Broadway spotlight, the ultimate medal to pin on the ego. Executives down the ladder may hop off on some quixotic adventure, but what about someone on the doorstep of the chairman's office? Never. No, make that hardly ever. Alex Mandl, the AT&T president, seemed the heir apparent to Robert Allen, the chairman. But Mr. Mandl, 52, hopped off last week, taking the top job at tiny Associated Communications, which has big, big plans in wireless communications. What's the lesson here? (There must always be a lesson.) Well, it could be something profound about the fast-shifting horizons of the new, deregulated world of communications. Or, perhaps, it has something to do with the new company dangling a check in front of Mr. Mandl that looked as if it should have had Michael Jordan's name on it: a $20 million signing bonus. LOTTERIES Fantasies, Tamed With a lottery, the house always wins. That's the point. And in New York, it wins big -- the state doesn't spend $42 million a year on ads for nothing. So what does it take to get the huddled masses, yearning to spend free, to plunk down precious dollars when the odds are so miserable? Simple: those ads, which have raised the selling of fantasies to an art form. ''Hey, you never know,'' the sirens call; that mansion is just waiting for you. Enter Gov. George E. Pataki, worried that the ads promised too much. (Ads exaggerate? Never!) Scrap the mansions, he said. So the new ads feature winners boasting of the new blenders they received, or the new shoes. Honest, yes, but only a real blender freak would have to be strapped to the mast to resist that siren song. TRADE A New Deficit Champ Well-trained newspaper readers know that if the first sentence is about the dreaded trade deficit, the second sentence will be about Japan -- about, yet again, how we buy so much from the Japanese and sell them so little. Year after year after year. Well, brace yourself (drums and cymbals, please): For the first time ever, Japan is not the largest source of the American deficit. In June, the figure for China rose to $3.3 billion, while for Japan it fell to $3.2 billion. Why? Well, China is selling us a lot of toys, clothes and other stuff, while Japan, emerging from recession, can afford more stuff for itself -- often foreign stuff. But one thing is the same: Though the deficit fell in June, America continues to devour the world's goods. PROSTATE TROUBLE What Works, What Doesn't So: Bill Clinton is 50. More yesterdays than tomorrows and all that. Also, perhaps, more prostate trouble -- it hits half of men over 50. And as it happens, prostate remedies were also in the news in the Birthday Week. The New England Journal of Medicine reported that Hytrin, from Abbott Laboratories, was effective against an enlarged prostate, while Merck's drug, Proscar, did little better than a placebo. Merck, which had approved the study's methods, now says the study wasn't designed properly after all. PRISONS A Grim Success Story When a business takes off, it's normally a cause for rejoicing. Jobs are created, widgets abound, economists smile. But at least one of today's hot industries must bring little joy: the prison business. Can anyone truly applaud when a society, whether concerned with safety, politics or morality, feels it must lock up a huge proportion of its citizens? Any doubt that prisons are indeed booming were surely dispelled last week when the American Correctional Association put on what had to be the world's largest prison trade show. There were more than 600 booths and 5,000 conventioneers at the vast Nashville show, which featured everything from $40,000 temporary cells to $250 ballistic batons to razor wire that comes in so many varieties you'd think cereal companies were making it.", "headline": {"main": "DIARY", "kicker": "DIARY"}, "abstract": "Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, campaigning in New Jersey, receive dubious response to Republican tax-cut proposal (S)", "print_page": "2", "word_count": 1123, "_id": "4fd1d3e28eb7c8105d7109a8", "snippet": "REPUBLICANS  A Tax-Cut Pilgrimage    It wasn't a quiet week, in Lake Wobegon or anywhere else, as the Republicans endlessly sang their new tax-cut anthem.
