Although he had battled a variety of lung and liver ailments for years, he seemed worse than usual, Margaret recalled not long ago -- bad enough, she thought, that he should get to the emergency room. The nearest E.R. was at Advocate Christ Medical Center, four miles away in Oak Lawn, a mostly working-class Chicago suburb. Both Loncars had been admitted and treated there before; a few months earlier, doctors performed emergency surgery on Michael's lungs. The Loncars were satisfied with the treatment at Christ Medical, as it is known. Their problem was that they already owed the hospital more than $40,000. Michael, who for years had been too sick to work, had no health insurance, and Margaret had acquired hers only a few months before. Margaret's salary as a Wal-Mart cashier was barely enough to support the couple and their two children -- a 17-year-old daughter at home and a 22-year-old daughter away at college. It left no money for adding Michael and the kids to her health plan, let alone for paying a five-figure hospital bill.", "headline": {"main": "Uncharitable?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "51", "word_count": 4882, "_id": "4fd25a6e8eb7c8105d807171", "snippet": "Nonprofit hospitals are quietly charging indigent patients.
