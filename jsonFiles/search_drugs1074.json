Patients literally waste away, acquiring an almost skeletal look. Some actually die from the wasting rather than the cancer, researchers say. Even though wasting is considered a serious illness in and of itself, the mechanism has eluded scientists. British researchers, however, say they have identified a central biochemical player in the process of wasting, a substance they say is made by tumor cells that appears to cause the weight loss. It is a highly unusual molecule -- a small protein attached to a large sugar, classified as a proteoglycan -- and it is unlike any substance ever linked to wasting in the past.
