That would make it illegal for scientists to extract stem cells from very early embryos -- microscopic clusters of cells, really -- that would be created in a lab and destroyed by the extraction process. A ban would not only block cutting-edge research, but could also lead to an exodus of the very best specialists to California, where such research has been endorsed by a referendum and backed by up to $3 billion in bond revenues. Mr. Romney was reacting to Democratic leaders in the Legislature who introduced a bill to promote embryonic stem cell research, including the sort that Mr. Romney finds unacceptable. The line drawn by Mr. Romney is at least more expansive than the highly restrictive one drawn by President Bush, who is allowing federal funds to be used only for research on a small number of embryonic stem cell lines that existed when he issued his policy. Mr. Romney would allow, with certain safeguards, research on stem cells taken from embryos that would otherwise be discarded at fertility clinics. That could make a lot more stem cell lines available, but not the kind vital for studying many diseases.", "headline": {"main": "Stem Cell Politics in Massachusetts", "kicker": "Editorial"}, "abstract": "Editorial expresses hope that Gov Mitt Romney of Massachusets is only posturing for national audience of conservative Republicans by favoring ban on some of most promising stem cell research planned at prominent institutions in his state; says Legislature needs to allow that research to move forward", "print_page": "24", "word_count": 283, "_id": "4fd2a5de8eb7c8105d88d9e5", "snippet": "A ban on creating human embryos for research in Massachusetts would not only block cutting-edge research, but could also lead to an exodus of specialists to California.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/11/opinion/11fri3.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BUSH, GEORGE W"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ROMNEY, MITT"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "MASSACHUSETTS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "REPUBLICAN PARTY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STEM CELLS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FETAL TISSUE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAW AND LEGISLATION"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-02-11T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Massachusetts Democrats and several prominent researchers unleashed a flurry of objections on Thursday to Gov.
