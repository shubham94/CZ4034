[Page C1.] How a New Employee Uncovered an Unusual Refco Loan Peter F. James had been working at Refco for less than two months when he noticed something this summer that teams of accountants had apparently missed for years. Mr. James, recently hired in the controller's office, wondered why a larger-than-normal interest payment had been made to Refco on an outstanding loan made by the company. In August he started to ask questions, eventually taking his concerns to the chief financial officer. The answers would eventually lead to the departure of the chief executive and the rapid unraveling of the firm, prompting its filing for bankruptcy protection last week. [C1.] Village Voice to Be Acquired by Publisher Group The company that publishes The Village Voice and five other alternative newspapers is to announce today an agreement to be acquired by New Times Media, the largest publisher in the market. The deal would create a chain of 17 free weekly newspapers around the country with a combined circulation of 1.8 million. The merger will undoubtedly raise questions about whether The Voice and its siblings can preserve their anti-establishment roots as part of a growing corporation. [C1.] Used and Useless Computers Litter Developing Countries Much of the used computer equipment sent from the United States to developing countries for use in homes, schools and businesses is often neither usable nor reparable, creating enormous environmental problems in some of the world's poorest places, according to a report to be issued today by an environmental organization. The report says that the unusable equipment is being donated or sold to developing nations by recycling businesses in the United States as a way to dodge the expense of having to recycle it properly. The report, prepared by the Basel Action Network of Seattle, focuses on Nigeria, in western Africa, but says the situation is similar throughout much of the developing world. [C5.] Movie Directors Bring New Skill to Video Games The line between movies and video games is blurring. Major movie studios, with libraries of movies, want to make video games, and video game makers see potential in movies. And now a new generation of movie directors who grew up playing video games are bringing their storytelling skills to that world. [C1.] Cisco Develops Technology for Radio Communication Cisco Systems plans to announce a new method for marrying the frequently incompatible radio gear used by emergency service agencies and businesses, using an Internet telephone standard. The approach is aimed at connecting the diverse array of push-to-talk radio systems with other voice and data systems without the expense of replacing the existing systems. [C5.] Consumer Blogs Get Attention From Product Makers As the number of blogs has grown, more consumers are keeping Web diaries dedicated exclusively to their favorite brands. Most of these, like one maintained by Darren Rovell, left, who compiles articles and commentary on Gatorade, are done without the consent of the companies that own the brands, but some companies are starting to pay attention, using the blogs as a kind of informal network of consumer opinion. [C6.] Criticism of Yahoo Disclosure in China Rises Yahoo has suffered a good deal of opprobrium since it was revealed last month that, when government officials came calling, the company's Hong Kong division simply surrendered information on a Chinese citizen who had presumably sought anonymity in a Yahoo e-mail address. Yahoo contends that it must obey the laws of the land in which it operates, but the online reaction is growing more critical.

While there's reason to wonder if those theories will hold up, Florida has been responsible and serious in preparing this test. It makes sense to give it a try, while watching carefully to make sure some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the country do not suffer as guinea pigs.
