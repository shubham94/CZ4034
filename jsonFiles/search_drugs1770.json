A few pilgrims brave the chill to visit this monument to man's ingenuity. They bundle up in woolen scarves and overcoats, then hurry home to a warm fire and a hot toddy to keep from catching cold. A few miles south of Stonehenge, pelted by the same winds, stands another curiously English monument to patience - a colony of decrepit prefabricated huts and World War II frame barracks that looks like a movie set for ''The Great Escape.'' Here, another band of pilgrims is gathered. But rather than trying to avoid colds, these people are trying to catch them. For this circle of worn gray buildings is England's Harvard Hospital, where, since 1946, more than 18,000 visitors have made their way to try, at Government expense, to get sick. Harvard is one of the most important centers in the world for the study of the common cold. But it is also a quaint cross between a sophisticated virology laboratory and a British holiday camp. Somehow, for the past 36 years, the staff at Harvard has made visitors enjoy being dosed with the germs of this most ancient human ailment.", "headline": {"main": "STALKING THE COMMON COLD"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "75", "word_count": 4083, "_id": "4fd126728eb7c8105d5ed283", "snippet": "This time of year, on the lip of England's Salisbury Plain, the north wind whistles through the weathered monoliths of Stonehenge.
