The study found that low fitness is a risk factor of the same order as smoking. In the study, smokers with high blood pressure and high cholesterol who were in moderately good shape lived longer than nonsmokers who were healthy but sedentary. The finding is by no means a license for those who exercise to smoke or eat fatty foods, said the study's lead author, Dr. Steven N. Blair, director of research for the Cooper Institute for Aerobic Research in Dallas. But it goes a step further than previous research in that it measures precisely how dangerous poor fitness is in relation to other leading risk factors for premature death.", "snippet": "COMING on the heels of the Surgeon General's report last week recommending moderate exercise for good health, a new study provides one of the strongest incentives yet to walk and not drive, and to take the stairs and not the elevator.
