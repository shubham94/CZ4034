Bob Long had plans -- finish remodeling the kitchen, work in the garden, maybe even paint the flower box in the front yard that he'd promised his wife he'd get around to soon. Not that Long was lacking free time. For the past three years, Long, 37, had worked as a surveyor for CME Engineering nearby in Somerset. But several months earlier, he tore his rotator cuff while pounding a surveying stake, and the injury required surgery. He had been off work for about eight weeks, attending physical therapy sessions and catching up on odd jobs around the house. Now Long was eager to get back to work -- back to the routines of ordinary life, which he had been struggling to recapture ever since the events of last summer when, for a brief, hallucinatory moment, he was a hero. A year ago, on July 24, when nine miners in nearby Quecreek cut into an old mine that was flooded with millions of gallons of water, the attention of the nation was transfixed. Miners, of course, have been getting trapped underground for hundreds of years. But this particular melodrama, coming less than a year after 9/11 and so close to the crash site of Flight 93, was as much about redemption and faith as it was about rescuing nine men. And it was Bob Long who, answering a call in the middle of the night, had raced to the scene and used his satellite surveying instruments to pinpoint the spot to drill the crucial first air hole.
