This undoubtedly accounted for the reputation of spinach as a food rich in iron and calcium that children should eat if they want to be strong. In recent years a more sophisticated understanding of how nutrients are absorbed through the intestines into the body and of the many factors that can interfere with that absorption has led to a complete rethinking of the utility of foods and food combinations. Haters of spinach, for example, can now rejoice, for it turns out that it is not all that it is touted to be: it contains substances that impair absorption of iron and calcium. To be sure, the study of food-nutrient interactions is an infant science that requires much more research before the interactions are well understood. But they have become increasingly important in recent years, in part because of the increased consumption of vegetables, whole grains and other sources of dietary fiber.", "headline": {"main": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 1452, "_id": "4fd15e218eb7c8105d6463da", "snippet": "NUTRITIONAL scientists once assumed that if a food contained a good deal of a particular nutrient it was a good dietary source of that nutrient.

The Justices have tackled the problem in half a dozen decisions in the last few years, establishing different rules for automobile searches under different circumstances. Today the Court accepted an appeal by the State of Oklahoma, which asserted that some of the Court's recent decisions do not fit logically with others and asked the Justices to establish ''straightforward, workable'' rules for the police. The case is an appeal from a ruling of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, which overturned two narcotics convictions on the ground that the Oklahoma City police had failed to obtain any warrant before searching a suitcase in the trunk of a car and a box on the front seat. Question Is Which Decision Rules The car was parked in a motel parking lot, where the police had gone on the basis of a tip. There was no dispute that the police had probable cause to believe that the suitcase and the box contained illegal drugs. Rather, the dispute is over which of two recent Supreme Court decisions should govern the case.", "headline": {"main": "SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP ; NEW CASE COULD CLARIFY RULES ON CAR SEARCHES", "kicker": "SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "5", "word_count": 982, "_id": "4fd142b58eb7c8105d61b728", "snippet": "The Supreme Court agreed today to try once again to clarify one of the most confused areas of constitutional laws: the extent to which the police may search an automobile without a warrant.
