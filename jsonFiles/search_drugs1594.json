Hundreds of counties, small cities and towns as well as some old large cities are increasing taxes and reducing services to cope with the loss of money from the $4 billion-a-year program of general revenue sharing that Congress ended to help reduce the Federal deficit. Many no longer receive any direct aid from Washington for the first time since enactment of President Johnson's Great Society programs of two decades ago. Around the nation, a reassessment of taxing systems has begun among state and local governments because of Federal tax revision, which reduced tax rates and removed many tax advantages for particular interests. As a result, states that base their tax systems on the old Federal system expect more revenue unless they revise their tax codes. Officials are also under pressure from taxpayers to ease the burden of local and state sales taxes, which are no longer deductible from Federal tax liability.", "headline": {"main": "LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN U.S. IS RESHAPED BY FEDERAL MOVES"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1767, "_id": "4fd1689d8eb7c8105d657e6f", "snippet": "The policies and processes of local government face substantial change because of Federal action on taxes and the budget deficit as well as court and Congressional challenges to local authority, according to officials at every level of government...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/us/local-government-in-us-is-reshaped-by-federal-moves.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "REFORM AND REORGANIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TAXATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FEDERAL AID (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LOCAL GOVERNMENT"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "John", "lastname": "HERBERS"}, {"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 2}], "original": "By JOHN HERBERS, Special to the New York Times"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1986-11-30T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "U.S."}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 43}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
