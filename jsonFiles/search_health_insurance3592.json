A sense of entitlement about the ''right'' to affordable health care certainly contaminates the debate about the cost of drugs in particular and health care more generally. As Sullivan correctly argues, the pharmaceutical industry is part of the capitalist system, and it takes huge financial risks to develop its products. Part of the payoff for taking these risks is a higher profit margin. However, the subscription rates of health insurance are going through the roof to pay for bills like Sullivan's, and his employer is most likely footing the bill for the increase. The question becomes, How long will his employer, who is really the ''merciful'' figure in this scenario, be willing to play the role of rescuer? If current trends continue, more and more companies will, out of financial necessity, decline to supply reasonable health coverage for their employees.
