The typical American diet has a higher fat content than nearly any other in the world. While agreement on this issue is not universal, many scientists blame this high-fat diet for a number of our chronic health problems and killing diseases, among them heart disease, obesity and possibly cancers of the colon and breast. Fat is a more concentrated source of calories than any other nutrient and thus is the most fattening foodstuff we regularly consume. A gram of dietary fat supplies your body with nine calories, compared to only four calories per gram of carbohydrates or protein. Even alcohol has fewer calories (seven per gram) than fat. Thus, cutting down on fats is one of the best ways to reduce caloric intake and achieve and maintain a normal body weight.", "snippet": "IF there is one nutrient that has the decks stacked against it, it's fat.
