He's so well spoken, his manners polished to such a high gloss, that -- aside from the fact that he's been a methamphetamine addict and career criminal since age 13 whose only formal education is a high-school degree earned in juvenile detention -- he could blend easily into a gathering of witty young professionals. Certainly he is equally engaged by his work. Until recently, Patrick often earned his living robbing drug dealers and the occasional small business. ''There's a lot of thought and energy that goes into getting loaded and planning a crime,'' he explains. ''It's dramatic -- the excitement, the carefree feeling that comes when you succeed. That's not something that happens in the monotone of everyday life. That's why for me, feeding my mind and spirit will be as important as anything I do in terms of abstaining. Because if I get bored. . . . '' He lets the threat hang, unspoken. Patrick is 30, tall and rangy, with sandy, short-cropped hair and a neatly trimmed goatee. He and I are in the small library of Center Point, a substance-abuse treatment facility in San Rafael, Calif., about half an hour north of San Francisco, where he is enrolled in a six-month residential program. Patrick is a ''retread'': this is his second time through here in a year, initially in exchange for a suspended sentence on charges of possessing drugs and stolen property. He completed the program last June and got a job restoring boats in Sausalito, convinced that his own ship had finally come in. But within five weeks he had moved from swallowing pain pills for a bad back to downing a couple of beers with his older brother. Then he started lighting up a few joints. In less than two months, he headed to San Francisco on a meth binge. He had planned to stay high until his money ran out, he was arrested for violating probation or he died. But one night, holed up in a transient hotel with an old crime partner and a prostitute, Patrick had a revelation. ''I was suddenly disgusted with the whole scene,'' he recalls. ''I had this thought -- or this thought was given to me -- that I just couldn't do it anymore. I just couldn't.'' He called Center Point and said he needed help. Within 24 hours he was back.", "headline": {"main": "Staying Clean"}, "abstract": "Peggy Orenstein article on debate over whether drug rehabilitation programs actually work; finds that single most important factor in predicting whether drug addict will stay clean is length of time that he or she spends in treatment program; photos (L)", "print_page": "34", "word_count": 7765, "_id": "4fd21b2a8eb7c8105d79a0c6", "snippet": "Patrick T. is prone to citing Oscar Wilde and the physicist Michio Kaku.
