I want to welcome you to the third and last of the 2004 debates between President George Bush and Senator John Kerry. As Jim Lehrer told you before the first one, these debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight the topic will be domestic affairs. But the format will be the same as that first debate. I'll moderate our discussion under detailed rules agreed to by the candidates. But the questions and the areas to be covered were chosen by me. I have not told the candidates or anyone else what they are.", "headline": {"main": "Transcript of Debate Between Bush and Kerry, With Domestic Policy the Topic", "kicker": "THE 2004 CAMPAIGN"}, "abstract": "Transcript of third presidential debate between Pres Bush and Sen John Kerry; photo (L)", "print_page": "22", "word_count": 15809, "_id": "4fd247f48eb7c8105d7e4055", "snippet": "Following is a transcript of the presidential debate last night in Tempe, Ariz., between President Bush and Senator John Kerry, as recorded by The New York Times.
