Kennedy established the President's Council on Physical Fitness. The fitness bug that bit many adults has not carried over to the younger generation. There are many reasons for this sad state of affairs. As school budgets tighten, physical education classes are often curtailed or abandoned. One in four children gets no physical education in school, and Illinois is the only state that requires daily phys-ed for all children, kindergarten through high school. In most school districts, the idea of a sound mind in a sound body has been abandoned, despite evidence that physically active children tend to do better in school.", "snippet": "Two distressing facts about the nation's youth bode ill for their future well-being: American children today are fatter than ever and less fit than they were in the 1960's, when John F.
