(Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.) The author recounts her fieldwork studying an outpost of intrepid scientists at the Smithsonian's tropical research station in Panama, home to an astounding array of flora and fauna. Royce is ''a perfect guide: intensely curious, smart, occasionally unimpressed, a little relentless and so personal she lets us watch her taking a pregnancy test,'' Ann Finkbeiner wrote here in 2001. ''The book is a charmer.'' THE DARK ROOM, by Rachel Seiffert. (Vintage International, $13.) This first novel invents three ordinary Germans -- each representing a different generation and social class -- and traces the evolution in their moral awareness from the delusion of the Nazi years to the denial of guilt after World War II to the decades of national soul-searching that followed. ''Seiffert writes lean, clean prose,'' David Sacks said here last year. ''Deftly, she hangs large ideas on the vivid private experiences of her principal characters.'' BOSWELL'S PRESUMPTUOUS TASK: The Making of the Life of Dr. Johnson, by Adam Sisman. (Penguin, $15.) How did James Boswell, thought to be an intellectual lightweight, a libertine and a groupie, manage to produce the masterly ''Life of Samuel Johnson'' in 1791? According to this biography of a biography, Boswell was hardly a nitwit but a highly conscious, skilled author well matched to his subject. The result is a ''smart'' and ''readable'' account that is ''also a closely focused but highly affecting portrait of Boswell the writer,'' Charles McGrath wrote in these pages last year. REACHING FOR GLORY: Lyndon Johnson's Secret White House Tapes, 1964-1965. Edited by Michael Beschloss. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $15.) The second volume of Johnson's White House tapes, covering a pivotal year of his presidency in which he pushed his Great Society programs through Congress and plunged America into Vietnam, reveals L.B.J. in full throat, bullying and cajoling, lobbying and jawboning, whining and strategizing. '' 'Reaching for Glory' provides an incomparable portrait of a president at work, and the workings of a president's mind,'' George Stephanopoulos said here last year. Touchstone has also reissued PRESIDENT NIXON: Alone in the White House, by Richard Reeves ($16), highlighted by a rich selection of musings and outbursts from Richard Nixon's yellow legal pads. ''They are rhetorical treasures, radiating at once the glint of the 37th president's madness and nobility of intention,'' Rick Perlstein wrote in the Book Review in 2001. Reeves is ''a researcher of high standards and a writer whose paragraphs can read like delicacies.'' Jack: A Life Like No Other, by Geoffrey Perret (Random House, $14.95), is a portrait of John F. Kennedy and his times that contains few surprises but is ''thoroughly grounded in fact, free of partisan bias and believable,'' our reviewer, Michael Lind, found last year. THE CENTER OF THINGS, by Jenny McPhee. (Ballantine, $13.95.) Among the objects in motion in this first novel about true love and modern physics are a dying film siren named Nora Mars, her dissolute third husband (of five), an aspiring tabloid writer trying to finish an essay on the philosophy of science and her soul mate, a ''freelance intellectual'' in blue pajamas who is happy to chat about quantum mechanics in the library stacks. McPhee ''knows how to keep things light,'' Dennis Overbye wrote here in 2001. ''All her cosmic vamping adds a teasing hint of intellectual relief to a tale of tangled lives.'' ERASURE, by Percival Everett. (Hyperion, $14.95.) Thelonious, or Monk, Ellison is a struggling avant-garde writer whose obsession with another black novelist's success leads him to fire off a bitter parody, a gangsta fantasy titled ''My Pafology.'' It's a hit, of course, forcing Monk to choose between commercial success and his artistic standards. ''With equal measures of sympathy and satire,'' this novel ''craftily addresses the highly charged issue of being 'black enough' in America,'' Jenifer Berman said here last year. HALF A lIFE, by V. S. Naipaul. (Vintage International, $13.) This father-and-son tale about an ascetic Indian man and his rootless son, who tries to unravel his spiritual identity in 1950's London and later in colonial Africa, contains many echoes of the author's earlier fiction. Last year our reviewer, Michael Gorra, found this to be an uneven novel, but said Naipaul's ''terse prose works, as always, to imply a world in a phrase.''

Because it's clear that, while the end is coming to Central Perk, waiting to be served up in some indeterminate blend of whimpering and banging one Thursday night in the not-too-distant future, those whose job it is to close the shutters from the inside are elsewhere. They -- a team of hard-working, well-paid, stressed-out writers -- are sequestered in a Warner Brothers office building in Burbank, Calif., in a bland conference room whose secrets are guarded with the zeal of national security matters. There they grapple with the question of how, after nine years of pratfalls and clever repartee, the quirky, sexually active, emotionally arrested friends of ''Friends,'' NBC's pre-eminent pop-cultural franchise, are to be frozen into eternal postures of camaraderie or enmity. On the specifics of exit strategy, these writers are mum. They have their reasons. Personally and professionally, they are in no great hurry to skip ahead to this particular finish line, beyond which lies the uncertain and ill-protected lot of ex-employees of a hit show. They may not yet have even determined -- let alone committed to paper -- what lies in store for Central Perk's forever-young clientele. Instead, the writers are standing by while the forces of marketing and promotion whip up a state of sweet and highly rated anticipation. Of course, they are shrewd enough to realize that in their realm there are no endings for the victors, but only a splendidly compensated afterlife in the heights of syndication, en route to a flickering and contented Nick at Nite of the soul.", "headline": {"main": "Killing Your Friends"}, "abstract": "Mark Levine article on planning for finale of hit NBC television series Friends, now in its last season; drawing; photos (L)", "print_page": "72", "word_count": 3899, "_id": "4fd2890b8eb7c8105d85ab16", "snippet": "To get a primer on endings -- happy endings, wistful endings, big-money endings, long-drawn-out-tear-stained endings -- it might be advisable to stroll right on past Central Perk, the most lucrative fantasy coffee bar in the imaginary West Village,...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/03/magazine/killing-your-friends.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "FRIENDS (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Mark", "lastname": "Levine"}], "original": "By Mark Levine"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2002-11-03T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}, {"type_of_material": "Review", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Arts & Ideas/Cultural Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Idealism survives in unlikely precincts of current pop: in hard-core punk, in alternative hip-hop, in albums by old-guard rockers and in the songs of one of Mexico's most popular bands, Man\u00e1, which filled the Theater at Madison Square Garden on Monday night with fans who sang along.
