''The integrity of the game is everything,'' the commissioner said in an interview late last week. ''We've got to eliminate illegal substances from the game, substances which can be used to control people, such as apparently happened at Tulane.'' He added, ''This office was created in 1920 to stop a gambling scandal.'' Although he cited testimony by baseball players to a Pittsburgh grand jury investigating drug use as a factor in his call for mandatory drug tests, Ueberroth's references to Tulane and 1920, which he repeated several times in recent days, were unmistakable indications that his concern over baseball's drug problem extends beyond the Pittsburgh case and even beyond how many players are using drugs. By talking of potential scandal, he has framed the issue in terms that are at once larger and yet fundamental to the game: that the action on the field must remain above suspicion.", "headline": {"main": "DRUGS SEEN AS PERIL TO GAME ITSELF"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1414, "_id": "4fd162028eb7c8105d64cb8f", "snippet": "Commissioner Peter Ueberroth wants baseball players to submit to drug tests because of a fear that players who become dependent on cocaine are potentially vulnerable to gamblers seeking inside information or seeking to control the results of games,...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/12/sports/drugs-seen-as-peril-to-game-itself.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "UEBERROTH, PETER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASEBALL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUG TRAFFIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GAMBLING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUG ADDICTION"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Michael", "lastname": "GOODWIN"}], "original": "By MICHAEL GOODWIN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1985-05-12T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Sports"}], "meta": {"hits": 2, "offset": 0, "time": 57}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
