The client, as Nick Newcombe, who was overseeing her home care, had explained, was resisting help and had fired a succession of workers. Newcombe thought the client would feel empowered if she had a choice, and so had arranged for Lorna and two other aides to be interviewed by the woman, her nephew Howard (Buzz) Katzen and his wife. Dressed in a pale yellow suit, Lorna, a 35-year-old Jamaican immigrant, sat in the lobby of the building on Central Park West and waited to be summoned upstairs. She went over in her mind what more she knew of this woman's history: that the week before, Rose Enselman had called the police, saying she was being held prisoner by the home attendant. Then she had barricaded herself in her bathroom while naked and demanded the bread and water that was any prisoner's due. The police, upon arrival, had summoned an ambulance, and Rose was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital for psychiatric evaluation and treatment.", "headline": {"main": "The Last Best Friends Money Can Buy"}, "abstract": "Ted Conover article on Lorna Kingston, one of many Caribbean immigrants who are increasingly providing home health care for aged New Yorkers, and Rose Enselman, 99, who is determined to stay independent despite increasing feebleness and delusions; focuses on loving care often provided under hard working conditions by aides like Kingston, who may be last human contact many of aged will have; photos (L)", "print_page": "124", "word_count": 7690, "_id": "4fd214338eb7c8105d78c529", "snippet": "Normally you didn't have to interview for a home health care placement -- the agency just told you where to be, and when, and a little background information on the client.
