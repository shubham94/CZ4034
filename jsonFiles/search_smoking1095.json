But, in so doing, Mr. Conn and other proponents of smoking restrictions ignore basic scientific literature on the claimed health effects of cigarette smoke in the air. They rest their claims that employers can save substantially by hiring nonsmokers on faulty research. Contrary to the opinion of proponents of workplace smoking restrictions, none of the dangers of cigarette smoke to nonsmokers set forth in Mr. Conn's article has been established.", "snippet": "Norman Conn's arguments in support of workplace smoking restrictions [''Speak Up Against the Smokers,'' May 12]  are as familiar as they are deficient.

''I had to sit for three hours without a cigarette,'' recalled Mr. Wilson, who smokes a pack-and-a-half to two packs of Reynolds's Camel filters a day. ''I did all right.'' But except for such occasions, Mr. Wilson, who has smoked for more than 30 years, sees no reason to kick the habit. Sitting in his office just after a regular physical check-up, he is asked if his doctor has ever suggested he should. ''He better not!'' is the laughing reply. A few minutes later, in a more sober tone, he paused between each word for emphasis as he maintained that there is ''not any scientific evidence that elements contained in tobacco smoke cause disease in humans - period.''", "snippet": "TWO weeks ago, on the day his company announced it had agreed to buy Nabisco Brands Inc., and would become the nation's largest consumer products concern, J.
