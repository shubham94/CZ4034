Almost a thousand years ago, they began a torrid affair. They made love in the kitchens of convents and in the boudoir of the girl's uncle. They wrote hundreds of love letters. When the girl bore a child, they were secretly married, but the teacher was castrated by henchmen of the enraged uncle. At her lover's bidding, the girl took religious orders. He took the habit of a monk. They retreated into separate monasteries and wrote to each other until parted by death. The story of Abelard and Heloise hardly resonates with the spirit of our age. Not least, its origins in the classroom offend: teachers, we know, are not supposed to fall in love with their students. Heloise, moreover, is no feminist heroine, despite having been one of the best educated women of her age and writing some of its most affecting prose. Nobody who takes the veil on the command of her husband and swears ''complete obedience'' to him can hope to sneak into the bastion of feminism. Today, even the high romance of the couple's liaison strikes us as foreign: all that sacrifice and intensity! We live in a time of broad antiromanticism when teenagers, according to The Times Magazine, have given up on relationships altogether and adults write to the editor to salute their wisdom. ''Romance?'' scoffed one correspondent.

She had not, but after listening to him and meeting with his insurance agent, she decided that the policy made sense. Three years later, when she developed pronator teres syndrome, a painful nerve problem, in one arm and carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands and was no longer able to do her job, the policy premium of $519 a year seemed like the best money she had ever spent. But in 1997, after a year and a half of collecting $2,250 a month in benefits, the insurer, First Unum, stopped paying, even though Ms. Hurley's contract provided for lifetime benefits.
