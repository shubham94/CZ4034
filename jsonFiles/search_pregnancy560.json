He had a case of the hiccups that wouldn't go away. The problem started two days earlier. In the midst of what seemed a perfectly ordinary day, he started to hiccup and wasn't able to stop. He tried all the usual treatments. He held his breath. He drank glass after glass of cold water. He thought scary thoughts. But no matter what he did, every 20 to 30 seconds, his chest would jump, and then his throat would close, cutting short the involuntary intake of air. After two days of nonstop hiccupping, he went to the hospital. 1. THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT It was evening by the time Steve Ferrante, a physician assistant, saw the patient. The patient told him he didn't have any medical problems; didn't smoke or drink and took no medications. He had had two hernia operations -- one three years ago and one earlier that week. And he'd been hiccupping constantly for the past two days. Ferrante asked whether there were there any other symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills or cough? Nothing. Other than the hiccups, the patient felt fine. The physical exam was unremarkable.", "headline": {"main": "A Serious Case of Hiccups", "kicker": "DIAGNOSIS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "15", "word_count": 1415, "_id": "4fd2945d8eb7c8105d86f388", "snippet": "THE PATIENT'S STORY  A 46-year-old man came to the Metropolitan Hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side early one afternoon.
