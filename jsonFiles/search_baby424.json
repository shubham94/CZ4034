'GREY GARDENS' Opens March 7. Maybe the biggest question mark of the musical season, this intriguing show is an adaptation of the cult documentary about the eccentric socialite relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (2:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Opens Feb. 27. Dead pets, severed limbs, black Irish humor -- Martin McDonagh (''Pillowman'') is up to his old tricks in this devilish comedy about terrorism and torture (1:45).

Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show written and performed by Sarah Jones is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punchline. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman) 'DECEMBER FOOLS' Sherman Yellen takes a stab at the letters-in-a-drawer play (old letters are discovered, and lives are changed), and things get off to a promising start: a New York matron's disgruntled daughter finds some of Mom's old screeds and turns them into weapons. But the play is too long, and some dandy comedy is undercut by some tired melodrama (2:15). Abington Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JUMP/CUT' Neena Beber's play about an aspiring filmmaker's effort to document his best friend's illness limns despair while leaving the audience exhilarated -- by the fierce beauty of Beber's writing, and by a captivating performance by Luke Kirby as the brilliant, charismatic, darkly funny manic-depressive whose inescapable fate is the central mystery of the work (2:10). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Miriam Horn) * 'LENNY BRUCE IN HIS OWN WORDS' Jason Fisher does an impressive facsimile of this legendary comic in a nostalgic greatest-hits collection of his stand-up routines (1:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the archmanipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) 'THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE' Satire sans teeth by Charles Grodin about internecine warfare within a Fifth Avenue co-op board. Directed by Chris Smith, the show has the embarrassed air of someone who has just been served a choice steak and misplaced his dentures (1:30). Primary Stages, at 59E59, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'THE SEVEN' The wild ride of luckless ol' Oedipus -- accidentally offing Dad, marrying Mom, being dissed by the kids -- gets pimped to the nines in this frisky and funny new riff on the classic story. Written by Will Power and directed by Jo Bonney, the show is a freewheeling adaptation of one of the more static, less revered Greek tragedies, Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'': a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AVALON' Glory Sims Bowen's retelling of the Camelot legend from the women's point of view is entertaining but too long and uncertain in tone. The comic moments work better than the earnest ones (2:20). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Anita Gates) 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'THE BOOK OF THE DUN COW' An animal allegory about good and evil, this family musical by Randy Courts and Mark St. Germain is on the didactic side and could use more oomph. Providing some are an electric villain, Micah Bucey, and a warm-voiced mezzo, Carol Hickey. Still, a number of children at a recent performance seemed absorbed: they didn't squirm, they watched (2:15). West End Theater in the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Andrea Stevens) * 'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'PARADISE' A mostly articulate drama about an inarticulate young man who may have found Mr. Right or the tipping point that leads him into madness (1:30). Access Theater, 380 Broadway, north of White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444.( Zinoman) 'REAL BLACK MEN DON'T SIT CROSS-LEGGED ON THE FLOOR' The poet and playwright Malik's series of quick, interwoven scenes tracing the lives of African-American men in America, mainly in the last half century, can pack an emotional punch, but it works better as a showcase for some outstanding performances by its eight-member cast than it does as a theater piece (2:00). New Federal Theater, Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200. (Stevens) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian''comedienne'' is a Style book prohibition/lg Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212).868-4444. closing March 10 !(Phoebe Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100.(Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100.(Brantley) Last Chance 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by H.I.V. diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Isherwood) * 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779; closing Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine-tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ANNAPOLIS' (PG-13, 108 minutes) ''Annapolis'' is so gung-ho about the United States Naval Academy's ability to turn boys into fighting men and rebels into scrappy team players that it could easily be confused with a military recruiting film. (Stephen Holden) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'BUBBLE' (R, 72 minutes) A rigorously minimalist story about three factory workers, all played by nonprofessionals, whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked. Violence liberates the three from the bubble of their existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated the movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CACH\u00c9 (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens) 'DESERT WIND' (No rating, 80 minutes, in French) In March 2004, the Swiss documentarist Fran\u00e7ois Kohler took 13 men -- Canadian, French, Swiss and Belgian -- on a two-week trek in the Tunisian Sahara. The group was accompanied by a Swiss psychotherapist, as well as by a team of Tunisian guides with pack camels. The purpose of the trip: to stage a kind of men's encounter group in the desert, encouraging the participants to break away from received notions of masculinity and to talk about their desires, anxieties and deepest fears. Though it generates its share of unintentional giggles, ''Desert Wind'' does manage to take us to a seldom-visited place: the hidden corners of the straight male mind. (Stevens) 'FILM GEEK' (No rating, 78 minutes) Scotty Pelk (Malik Malkasian) is a diminutive, socially addled young man whose sole interest in life is the cinema. When he's fired from his job for, in essence, being too annoying, Scotty goes on a downward spiral, begging for work at every video store in town and obsessively courting a pretty film fan (Tyler Gannon) despite her increasingly humiliating rejection of him. Despite this semiautobiographical film's likable premise, Scotty Pelk, as written by James Westby and played by Mr. Malkasian, is actually so irritating, so genuinely hard to take, that like the rest of the characters in the movie, we soon find ourselves itching to get away from him. (Stevens) 'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee) 'FIREWALL' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A thrill-challenged thriller starring Harrison Ford and directed by Richard Loncraine that manages to entertain mildly only because it traffics in all the familiar action-movie clich\u00e9s, giving filmgoers ample opportunity to test their action-movie I.Q.'s. (Dargis) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee) 'IMAGINE ME & YOU' (R, 93 minutes) A bland romance from the British writer and director Ol Parker about a woman (Piper Perabo) who's fast-tracking down the straight and narrow when the florist-next-door (Lena Headey) throws up a roadblock. (Dargis) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) 'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) 'PINK PANTHER' (PG, 92 minutes) Steve Martin steps into the shoes of Peter Sellers in this intermittently witty revival of a vintage comedy franchise. Though finely honed, Mr. Martin's portrayal of the idiotic French police inspector Jacques Clouseau can't match Sellers's viscerally funny one. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee) 'THROUGH THE FIRE' (No rating, 103 minutes) Jonathan Hock's unwaveringly upbeat documentary follows the basketball sensation Sebastian Telfair, a senior at Lincoln High School on Coney Island, as he chooses between the University of Louisville and the N.B.A. Yet behind the cheering and popping flashbulbs lurks another, much darker movie, one that questions the relationship between sneaker manufacturers and financially deprived kids with exceptional talent. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clich\u00e9s. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned \u00fcber-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'A YEAR WITHOUT LOVE' (No rating, 95 minutes, in Spanish) Anah\u00ed Berneri's debut film recounts in uncomfortable close-up the day-to-day activities of a youngish gay writer from Buenos Aires afflicted with AIDS, who becomes involved in S-and-M. Based on the diaries of the real Pablo Per\u00e9z (he is also co-writer of the script), the film reveals rare insight into the endurance and treatment of illness, but is never fully arresting. (Laura Kern) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series BEST OF THE AFRICAN DIASPORA FILM FESTIVAL (Through Wednesday) BAMcinematek's festival of independent black films from around the world begins today.

(Laura Sinagra) BOBBY BARE JR., TEDDY THOMPSON (Tuesday) Bobby Bare Jr. of Nashville is a blunt songwriter who doesn't mince words. His music tweaks Americana with sounds from the new weird America. Another musical scion, Teddy Thompson, looks to distinguish himself from his folk-rocker parents, Richard and Linda, while still honoring their legacy. His baritone voice sounds like his father's without the bite, not always a bad thing. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra) BLACK REBEL MOTORCYCLE CLUB, ELEFANT (Tomorrow) Moving lately from the surly, noisy sound its name implies to a rootsier realm, the Los Angeles rockers Black Rebel Motorcycle Club now play harmonica and strum away on acoustic guitars.

(Sinagra) BUCKWHEAT ZYDECO (Tomorrow) Stanley (Buckwheat) Dural Jr. is a zydeco accordionist whom rockers can love.

Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $13.

(Pareles) LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO, VUSI MAHLASELA (Tomorrow) The choir Ladysmith Black Mambazo is one of South Africa's long-running musical treasures, melding a tradition of Zulu harmony with imported gospel and soul. In the group's dynamic ''stalking style,'' Joseph Shabalala's companionable tenor hovers above the group's resonant, bass-heavy harmonies, which build from a cavernous hush to fervent, driving peaks. Vusi Mahlasela was one of the most important songwriters of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, not just for his political courage but also for his sterling voice and for three-chord rockers that make earnest sentiments bounce. 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722; $17 to $50. (Pareles) PHIL LESH & FRIENDS (Tonight through Sunday) The Grateful Dead's repertory and approach to jamming are Hydra-headed, and Phil Lesh, the Dead's bassist, always recruits skillful ''friends'' for his own band to conjure the sparkling unpredictability of the Dead's finest moments. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, (212) 564-4882, $37.50 and $49.50.

(Sinagra) YEAH YEAH YEAHS, BLOOD ON THE WALL (Thursday) The fashion-forward singer Karen O and her post-punk Yeah Yeah Yeahs' new material moves further away from the precision noise-rock of their past and spotlights more singing than forceful declaration. The shaggy Brooklyn trio Blood on the Wall, fronted by the guitarist and vocalist Brad Shanks and his sister, the bassist and vocalist Courtney Shanks, make hip-shaking rock with a touch of Midwestern-gothic twang. 8 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; (sold out). (Sinagra) ZAGNUT CIRKUS ORKESTAR (Tonight) The accordionist Matthew Fass leads this six-piece Balkan brass band in music combining Greek, Turkish, Middle Eastern, Roma and jazz.

(Chinen) BERNARD HERRMANN'S MUSIC FOR THE 21ST CENTURY (Monday) The iconic film scores of Bernard Herrman -- not only his work with Hitchcock, but also with Truffaut, Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma -- should serve as fine fodder for the clarinetist and saxophonist Marty Ehrlich, the pianist Ted Rosenthal, the guitarist Brad Shepik, the bassist Greg Cohen and the drummer Erik Charlston; this performance is a prelude to the group's premiere in London with full orchestral backing. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover, $15 in advance, $18 at the door, with a two-drink minimum.(Chinen) JOHN HOLLENBECK'S LARGE ENSEMBLE (Tonight and tomorrow night) The percussionist and composer John Hollenbeck imbues this excellent orchestra -- it's not exactly a big band -- with thoughtful progressivism, harmonic depth and a twinge of irreverent humor. 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, www.thekitchen.org; $10. (Chinen) CHARLIE HUNTER TRIO (Through Sunday) Mr. Hunter's eight-string-guitar wizardry and loping groove have both been enshrined in jam band culture, a fact that can overshadow his harmonic sophistication. He brings everything to the table in his band with the tenor saxophonist John Ellis and the drummer Derrek Phillips. (In a late set, at 11:30 p.m., Mr. Ellis is to lead a trio of his own.) 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20 and $25.

(Chinen) BILL McHENRY QUARTET (Through Sunday) Both as a tenor saxophonist and a composer, Mr. McHenry heeds a patiently exploratory style; he often lets the focus shift to the harmonically advanced guitar playing of Ben Monder, the broadly dynamic bass playing of Reid Anderson and the sparse, intense drumming of Paul Motian. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) JEREMY PELT QUartet (Tuesday through Feb. 26) The clarion tone and preternatural poise of Mr. Pelt's trumpet playing have earmarked him as a rising star in the jazz mainstream; as on his most recent album ''Identity'' (MaxJazz), he plays here with the pianist Frank LoCrasto, the bassist Vicente Archer and the drummer Eric McPherson. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) BEN PEROWSKY QUARTET (Sunday) As a drummer, Mr. Perowsky favors headlong propulsion, but he also has a contemplative side; this four-piece band, with Chris Speed on clarinet, Ted Reichman on accordion and Drew Gress on bass, conjures elevated atmospherics with a globe-trotting feel. 8 p.m., Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8.

(Chinen) VISION COLLABORATION NIGHTS (Thursday through Feb. 26) This scrappy mini-festival pairs avant-garde choreographers and dancers with like-minded musicians; among the reasons to attend this year is the omnipresence of Kidd Jordan, a gutsy tenor saxophonist and musical patriarch from New Orleans. Thursday through Feb. 25, from 7:30 to 10, Feb. 26,from 5 to 7 p.m., 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 696-6681, www.visionfestival.org; $20; $10 for students with ID.

(Anne Midgette) 'ALBERT HERRING' (Tomorrow) The Gotham Chamber Opera has been earning its stripes with striking stagings of everything from Handel's ''Arianna in Creta'' to Respighi's version of ''Sleeping Beauty'' (with puppets). Its latest production seeks to do justice to the underexplored comic side of Benjamin Britten, who wrote only one comic opera in his lifetime. The final performance is this weekend. 7:30 p.m., Harry de Jur Playhouse, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200; $30 to $65. (Midgette) 'HERCULES' (Tomorrow and Sunday) This Handel opera is rarely heard, but it has plenty to offer, not least a plot that describes a love triangle that proved lethal for Hercules. More to the point, it is a chance to see William Christie lead his extraordinary Parisian ensemble, Les Arts Florissants. The cast includes William Shimell, Joyce DiDonato and Ingela Bohlin. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $35 to $150.

(Jeremy Eichler) * BANG ON A CAN PEOPLE'S COMMISSIONING FUND CONCERT (Wednesday) The idea is music by the people, for the people: pooling donations as small as $5, Bang on a Can raises money to commission three new works a year, and people flock to hear the Bang on a Can All-Stars play them at the annual concert. This year's composers are Yoav Gal, Annie Gosfield and John Hollenbeck. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20.

(Holland) BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) The barge typically relies on ad-hoc ensembles of freelancers, but this weekend, two established groups are on deck. Tonight, it's the wind ensemble of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra playing Beethoven, Mozart and Poulenc. Tomorrow and Sunday, the Shanghai Quartet plays selections from Yi-wen Jiang's ''ChinaSong,'' a late Beethoven quartet and Brahms's Clarinet Quintet (with Ethan Sloane). Thursday, it's back to standard barge fare with the violinist Mark Peskanov and colleagues playing Mozart, Schubert and Beethoven.

Tuesday brings Nos. 14 and 15; Thursday will be Nos. 12 and 17; and Feb. 25, the group signs off with Nos. 18 and 19. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $97. (Eichler) CHAMBER MUSIC AT THE Y (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Mozart celebration is all very well, but how about some Martinu for a change? Or at least a compromise: as part of his chamber music series, Jaime Laredo presides over a program split between Martinu (the String Sextet and the Duo No. 1 for Violin and Cello) and Mozart (the Oboe Quartet in F and a Divertimento in D). Among the guest performers are the violist Kim Kashkashian, the oboist Maurice Bourgue and the violinist Jennifer Koh. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35.

(Kozinn) ERIC CUTLER (Tonight) Eric Cutler is a young tenor with a loud voice that's making some opera people listen. The Metropolitan Opera offers him this season as a solid if unrefined Tamino; the Richard Tucker Foundation gave him its 2005 award. Tonight, he offers songs of France (Hahn, Faur\u00e9), Italy (Respighi) and America (Musto, Previn and Barber). 7:30, Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $32. (Midgette) * LUIGI DALLAPICCOLA (Thursday) As Continuum's overview will show, this composer balanced innovation and links to earlier traditions. His music has disappeared to an alarming degree since his death in 1975, but when his music turns up, it invariably invites further exploration. This installment of the Composer Portrait series is your best chance. Included is a selection of works that run from the 1940's (''Rencesvals,'' the Sonata Canonica and ''Due Studi'') through 1970 (''Sicut Umbra''). 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $20; $12 for students.

Tonight at 7:30, tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $27 to $32.

(Eichler) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow and Thursday) The Philharmonic has made a big deal of paying tribute to Elliott Carter this season, but its performances of his works are so few and so widely spaced that you've probably forgotten about it. Not to worry: this week, Lorin Maazel and the orchestra get to one of Mr. Carter's true classics, the Variations for Orchestra, along with works by Brahms and Kodaly and, with Gil Shaham, Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1. On Thursday, Robert Spano takes over for the premiere of John Harbison's ''Milosz Songs,'' with Dawn Upshaw as the soloist, as well as works by Bartok and Bernstein.

(Holland) * 'LA PASI\u00d3N SEG\u00daN SAN MARCOS' (Monday and Tuesday) ''Fasten your seat belts'' was one insider's advice at the Brooklyn Academy of Music a few years ago when this lionized piece by the composer Osvaldo Golijov had its New York premiere. A recasting of a Bach Passion for the South American vernacular, this ''Pasi\u00f3n'' is certainly approachable and stirring, and Mr. Golijov's biggest popular success -- if not perhaps as ground-breaking as many seem to think. 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $65. (Midgette) * MARGARET LENG TAN (Tomorrow and Sunday) John Cage's 1944 score-painting, ''Chess Pieces,'' disappeared into a private collection soon after he wrote it, so when the pianist Margaret Leng Tan first saw it, last year, she knew she had a virtually unknown Cage work to perform. It wasn't that easy: the painting is a chessboard made of score shards, and Ms. Tan's job was to determine how those fragments were meant to fall together. She is playing the work, along with Vittorio Rieti's ''Chess Serenade'' and Michael Nyman's ''Pawn to King Four,'' as part of the Anthology Film Archives' ''Chess and Surrealism'' program. 8 p.m., Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 979-1027 ; $12. (Kozinn) * CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF (Wednesday) This exceptional 39-year-old German violinist does not have the name recognition of some other soloists or the marketing muscle behind his career, but the depth and sensitivity of his playing have rightly made him a favorite among critics and connoisseurs. This week, he is joined by the pianist Lars Vogt in a promising program of all three Brahms violin sonatas. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45. (Eichler) 'VoiceS OF LIGHT' (Tonight) Richard Einhorn composed this vivid, unusual oratorio as a soundtrack for Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent classic ''The Passion of Joan of Arc,'' a compressed telling of Joan of Arc's trial by an ecclesiastical court and of her execution by being burned at the stake. It is to be performed by the Ensemble Sospeso, the New Amsterdam Singers, and Anonymous 4, which assembles only for special projects these days. 8, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Kozinn) VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) George Steel and his superb chamber choir turn their attention to Jacobus Vaet, an obscure Flemish Renaissance master.

(Jennifer Dunning) RICHARD ALSTON DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) The choreographer Richard Alston has been a mainstay of English contemporary dance since the early 1970's, and his musical, often understated work is always worth watching. This program presents three dances new to New York audiences: ''Fever,'' to Monteverdi; ''Such Longing,'' to Chopin's Nocturnes and \u00c9tudes; and ''Gypsy Mixture,'' from the delightfully titled CD ''Electric Gypsyland.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $38.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces which the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and commerce,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. (See above.) (Smith) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown Boyd & Evans: Color in Black and White' This husband-and-wife team from England makes large landscape and cityscape photographs in which all but selected central images have been drained of color. The best pictures, like that of the rusty brown tank standing all by itself in the midst of a black and white desert, are more strange and dreamy than gimmicky. Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 439-1700, through Feb. 25. (Ken Johnson) Robert S. Neuman: 'Fifty Years' With good humored generosity and a skillful, sensuous touch, Mr. Neuman has painted his way through several different genres over the course of his five-decade career, including Abstract Expressionism, geometric formalism, funky allegorical narrative and painterly landscapes that mourn the losses of the American Indians. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through March 4. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Norman Ballard: 'Standing Waves' A theatrical lighting designer and veteran laser light artist presents recent compact sculptures in which fine, colored laser lines rhythmically swing or rotate through colored liquids in glass containers. Framed by rugged metal elements, the sculptures combine industrial-strength materialism and the hypnotic appeal of the lava lamp. Bryce Wolkowitz, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 243-8830, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) EIRIK JOHNSON: 'BORDERLANDS' Small, serendipitous encounters in the landscape are the subjects of Eirik Johnson's large color photographs: junk hung picturesquely on a wire fence along a shore; a red sweater splayed between trees in a woods; a fragile, impromptu bridge of skinny longs laid across a creek. In one photograph, a huge crumple of grayish fabric plopped on grass and maybe used as a shelter has the imposing look of a sculptural boulder. There are no control-freak setups here. Rather, it seems that Mr. Johnson helps the camera make its own discoveries, often with poetic results. Yossi Milo Gallery, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through Feb. 25. (Glueck) Sarah Pickering: 'Explosions' Winner of the 2005 Jerwood Photography Award, Ms. Pickering presents large and lush photographs of exploding bombs incongruously set off in pastoral settings as part of law enforcement training programs. Daniel Cooney, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 255-8158, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) ALEX SOTH: 'NIAGARA' Love and romance play tackily in these photographs of small town young people, while the nearby falls of Niagara provide a grand symphonic background. Mr. Soth's lens lingers on cheap motels that serve as wedding and honeymoon settings, people awkwardly dressed in celebration clothes, a purple-prose letter conveying declarations of the heart. On a grungy street an unglamorous mother stares unbeguilingly at the camera while cradling an infant. Mr. Soth, whose antecedents would seem to include the faux-vernacular photographs of William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, intersperses these shots with glorious scenics of the eternal Falls, doing their thing above and beyond local happenings. Ho, hum. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street (212) 741-1111, through Feb. 25. (Glueck) * TRIFECTA This energetic curatorial face-off consists of three exhibitions devoted to young artists (nearly 20 in all) organized by the gallery's owner, Becky Smith, and her assistants, Esme Watanabe and Erica Samuels. The three groupings progress from minimal to hyper-real, with Ms. Watanabe's selection, which lands somewhere in the middle, edging out those of her colleagues. Sara VanderBeek's set-up photographs, which suggest a Surrealist's garret, are a find. Bellwether, 194 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Feb. 25. (Smith) Johannes Wohnseifer: 'New Alphabet' Paintings and sculptures in several different styles by this brainy young German conceptualist obscurely explore semiotics relating to industrial, military, political and popular-entertainment spheres. He has a keen sense of design, and the sculptures made of pieces of shiny bent metal and thick felt are extremely elegant. But over all, his project looks like that of an academic theory wonk. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo * BEC STUPAK/HONEYGUN LABS: 'RADICAL EARTH MAGIC FLOWER' This ambitious gallery debut centers on a blind remake of Jack Smith's 1963 orgiastic ode to transvestism and Hollywood camp, ''Flaming Creatures,'' projected on a wall opposite the original, with Ms. Stupak's subtitlelike storyboards appearing in between. The contrast is mutually enhancing up to a point; the Stupak provides color and detail missing from the blurry, black-and-white Smith film, but the earlier effort still carries the day. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300, through Feb. 25. (Smith) * ZILVINAS KEMPINAS In contrasting works, the artist uses videotape to create one environment and record another. The resulting Op Art installation and the bike ride through Times Square conspire; sensory overload, both retinal and aural, ensues, as does a surprising application of the less-is-more principle. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455, through Feb. 25. (Smith) Other Galleries Carla Accardi and Lucio Fontana: 'Infinite Space' Bridging the gap between higher metaphysics and raw materialism in Italy in the 1960's and 70's, Fontana famously made single-color canvases that he decisively slashed or punctured, while Accardi wrapped strips of painted transparent plastic around wooden stretchers or painted fields of optically vibrating calligraphy. A selection of works by both artists makes for a surprisingly handsome and elegant show that is nicely complemented by a small installation of recent works by Richard Tuttle in the project room. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. Granted that much of Downtown was throwaway stuff, too ephemeral and experimental to last; for better or for worse, it helped to change the definition of what art and artists might be. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) * HOME STORIES: AN INSIDE LOOK AT SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES IN AUSTRIA Departing from standard-issue architectural exhibitions with a slightly too clever design, this show of 21 recent houses includes portraits of their inhabitants and poster-size sheets free for the taking that function as both labels and catalog. The totality feels like a collaboration among Bernd and Hilla Becher, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and the contemporary photographer of your choice, but it makes an excellent case for the vitality of Austrian architecture. Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, through Feb. 25. (Smith) * 'Speak: Nine Cartoonists' Original drawings and studies by nine of the best comic book artists in the business, including R. Crumb, Daniel Clowes, Gary Panter, Chris Ware and Art Spiegelman. Pratt Manhattan Gallery, 144 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 647-7778. Through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Last Chance * Ellen Brooks: Vintage Photographs from the 70's Cultural wars have come and gone -- actually, they've never really gone -- since 1976, when Ellen Brooks first showed a dozen larger-than-life-size studio photographs of nude male and female adolescents. Eight more pictures, never before exhibited, from the same series are on view at Roth, and it is easy to see how, in the right (meaning wrong) setting, they could still cause a fuss today. The inclusion of documentation, including early reviews of the work, give these remarkable pictures a historical context. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) WILLIE COLE: SOLE TO SOUL An adept recycler of found objects used as tools or in assemblages to evoke different varieties of African sculpture, Mr. Cole has expanded both palette and references in his latest efforts. Here women's high heels, arranged by hue, handsomely evoke rose windows, mandalas and lotus flowers, as well as religious multiplicity (Smith). Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 367-7474; closes tomorrow. (Smith) The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400; closes Sunday. (Cotter) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. (See above.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639; closes Sunday.(Johnson)", "headline": {"main": "The Listings: Feb. 17 - Feb. 23"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "28", "word_count": 15413, "_id": "4fd267138eb7c8105d81c41c", "snippet": "Selective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition.
