It can growl, groan, churn, turn, bloat, burn, cramp, ache and even double us over with stabbing pain. Few of us give our stomachs a second thought until and unless they malfunction, as they almost inevitably will. And when we experience any form of abdominal distress, we tend to blame the stomach for it, even though the symptoms might be caused by disorders of the esophagus, intestines, liver, gallbladder, appendix or ovaries. Still, actual stomachaches are extremely common in people of all ages - about as common as the misconceptions about their causes and treatment; some people aren't even sure where the stomach is and what it does.", "snippet": "THE stomach is subject to a laundry list of complaints.

The lowest death rates are associated with ''leanness in the 20's followed by a moderate weight gain into middle age,'' contends the researcher, Dr. Reubin Andres, clinical director of the Gerontology Research Center of the National Institute on Aging. ''This is, in fact, the weight pattern of most Americans,'' said Dr. Andres, who has garnered the support of some leading gerontologists. At the center of the debate are the venerable height and weight tables compiled by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The company's listings of ''desirable'' weights have been a guide, and not infrequently a source of anguish, for recent generations of body-conscious Americans. The weight ranges in the tables are said to be associated with the lowest death rates.", "snippet": "A NEW controversy over the safety of moderate weight gains in middle age has been set off by a Federal researcher's challenge of the prevailing medical view that lifelong efforts to stay lean are best for health.

That exercise teachers favor varying paths to fitness is not new, but increasingly in the East, particularly in Manhattan, they are teaching and training not in gymnasiums, health clubs or spas but privately, in peoples' homes. The reasons people exercise in private vary: There can be embarrassment over exercising with others because of obesity or lack of fitness; executives on tight schedules find it easier to work out in their offices or homes; people with disabilities or injuries have special needs that can sometimes be met more easily at home. Another principal reason is the simple desire for privacy by clients who can afford the $20 to $50 an hour personally tailored private fitness instruction generally costs.", "snippet": "Some teach exercises rooted in dance, some rely on aerobics.
