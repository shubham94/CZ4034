He has appropriated a cluster of comfortable armchairs for a meeting with two members of his team, Americans who work full time in Russia. The agenda is Russia's safety net or, more precisely, whether unemployed workers will be able to make ends meet. Russia is plunging out of Communism, if not directly into a capitalist free market. Whether this huge, humiliated nation will stoically bear the pain of the transition is far from clear, and the strength of the safety net could make the difference.", "headline": {"main": "Dr. Jeffrey Sachs, Shock Therapist"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "21", "word_count": 4245, "_id": "4fd1ddc58eb7c8105d7206bc", "snippet": "The lobby of the Metropole, Moscow's lovingly restored grand hotel a few blocks from Red Square, is almost deserted on this gray spring afternoon.
