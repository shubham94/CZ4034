The debut of Rotarix is particularly newsworthy because it took place in Mexico -- this is the first time a major drug company has bypassed America and Europe to introduce a vaccine. Glaxo plans to extend Rotarix to other Latin American countries and Asia by the end of the year. It has applied for approval in Europe and will eventually do so in the United States. An earlier vaccine against rotavirus, made by Wyeth, was pulled from the American market in 1999 for safety reasons. Because of this, some people will no doubt argue that by postponing approval in the United States, Glaxo is attempting to dump a possibly unsafe product in the third world. The opposite is true; by rushing to offer the product in a poorer country, Glaxo is speeding the vaccine directly to where it is most needed. It's a long-overdue step that makes perfect sense.", "headline": {"main": "The Vaccine Balance", "kicker": "Editorial"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "word_count": 644, "_id": "4fd25df28eb7c8105d80c70e", "snippet": "For the first time, an important vaccine is bypassing Europe and America and going directly to where it is needed most.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/29/opinion/29sat2.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "GLAXOSMITHKLINE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "VACCINATION AND IMMUNIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-01-29T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Opinion"}], "meta": {"hits": 3, "offset": 0, "time": 25}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
