When I told her I hadn't, she was so instantly approving I half-expected her to slap a gold star on my hospital gown. I had been a good girl, it seemed. My baby would feed more eagerly and efficiently, I'd be up and around sooner and, my burbly visitor implied, in the long run I'd feel better about myself. Did any of this spiel ring true? Not exactly. Not in my experience. My first baby, born after a 24-hour labor during which I had requested -- O.K., bleated piteously for -- an epidural, nursed avidly from the moment he breathed air. And I couldn't take credit for a conscious decision to forgo anesthesia this time; I'd simply been swept downstream by the sheer force of a shorter, more intense labor. I was glad to have experienced a different kind of childbirth this time around and grateful not to have been up all night. I was lucky to have had with me a midwife (and a husband and sister) who made an unmedicated labor seem possible, without ever implying that it was the True and Only Way. But that is not to say, as natural childbirth's cheerleaders do, that I was in some way a better person for it. It's not even to say that without anesthesia I was more alive to the miracle of birth. Pain concentrates the mind, but what it concentrates the mind on is pain.", "headline": {"main": "The Way We Live Now: 10-31-99:; Pay on Delivery"}, "abstract": "Margaret Talbot comment on advocates of drug-free childbirth who tout experience as if it were an extreme sport; says they do not see moral punishment in pain but do see moral superiority in refusing pain relief; photo (M)", "print_page": "19", "word_count": 1087, "_id": "4fd2310f8eb7c8105d7c028a", "snippet": "A couple of weeks ago, the morning after I gave birth to my second child, a particularly garrulous nurse stopped by my room and asked if I had been given an epidural pain block during labor.
