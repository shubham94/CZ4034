Because the entrepreneurs, Beth Heller and Tamara Quinn, linked their yoga business to referrals from Fertility Centers of Illinois, from which they subleased quarters in a rented building on the Chicago River, they temporarily relocated their business while the similarly displaced fertility clinic reconfigured and rebuilt the first floor offices after the July 2010 flood. This past July, the water damage from the second flood was not as severe. The company was able to stay open during the repairs, which required cutting out the bottom foot of some walls and bringing in industrial blowers. Because of delays with insurance assessments and payment approvals, the restoration dragged on until mid-October.", "headline": {"main": "Despite 2 Floods, Business Stays Put", "kicker": "YOU'RE THE BOSS"}, "abstract": "You're the Boss blog notes that Chicago business Pulling Down the Moon, which provides wellness services for women undergoing fertility treatments, has decided to stay put after recovering from damage caused by two floods.
