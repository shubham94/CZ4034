Instead of being controlled by insurance companies, they are aiming to establish their own managed-care companies. ''Hospitals are looking at ways of reinventing themselves and participating in the health care market,'' says Karen Smigel, a financial examiner with the Connecticut Insurance Department. She says she gets three to four inquiries each week from hospitals interested in starting an H.M.O., but estimates that only one in 100 files an application. ''An H.M.O. is a different mindset,'' she said. ''It's not as easy at it looks. You have to interact with other hospitals not as a competitor but as a provider in your network.'' The first hospital-owned H.M.O. in the state was Suburban Health Plan, established in 1988 by the Griffin Health Services Corporation and Avanti Health System of Texas. Griffin became sole owner of the H.M.O. in December, buying out New York Life (which had purchased the Sanus Corporation, which had earlier purchased Avanti). Suburban maintained a stable enrollment of around 2,800 members, primarily in the Naugatuck Valley area, until January of 1995. Through a stronger marketing effort -- aimed at small businesses and individuals -- membership has grown to 5,300. More than 1,000 doctors and three other hospitals participate in the plan. ''We are an experiment that, I think, has an opportunity to make it,'' says Harry Blair, a consultant with Creative Health Concepts in New York City, who works part-time as the executive director of Suburban. ''Insurance, as originally constituted, was to help you when you got sick,'' he says. ''The H.M.O. tries to deal with the patient before they get sick, through paying for preventive services and developing wellness programs. The H.M.O. says if you do these things, you will not get sick, or you won't be as sick. It's more patient focused.''", "headline": {"main": "The Changing Ways of Health Care"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "01", "word_count": 1139, "_id": "4fd1d8dc8eb7c8105d7181a6", "snippet": "FACED with increasing costs and fewer inpatient stays, many hospitals and doctors are joining together to take a more active role in how health care is provided.
