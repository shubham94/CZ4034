As a technical matter, the ruling is binding on only that one company. But the ruling -- the first time a court has addressed the issue of gender equity in drug coverage -- sets a legally solid precedent that may well encourage more health coverage of contraceptives nationwide. The issue caught fire a few years ago after it was discovered that many employers who excluded women's prescription contraceptives from coverage chose to pay for Viagra, the prescription drug to treat impotence in men. The class action suit, brought under the pregnancy discrimination provisions of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, challenged an obvious inequity -- the fact that the health insurance coverage offered by the chain paid for all the basic health care needs of male employees while selectively excluding the cost of birth-control pills or other forms of contraception. Judge Robert S. Lasnik found that Congress, in amending Title VII in 1978 to bar pregnancy discrimination, intended to outlaw any discrimination against women ''in the terms and conditions of their employment, including the benefits an employer provides to its employees.'' He added that men and women had different health care needs and that ''the law is no longer blind to the fact that only women can get pregnant, bear children, or use prescription contraception.''", "headline": {"main": "A Win for Contraception"}, "abstract": "Editorial welcomes ruling by Judge Robert S Lasnik of federal court in Washington State that local family-owned drugstore chain engaged in unlawful sex discrimination by excluding contraceptive coverage from its employee health plan; hopes this encourages opposition to Bush administration's attempt to end contraceptive coverage for federal employees, and affects New York State, where bill that would require Catholic hospitals and schools to provide female employees insurance coverage for contraceptives is stalled because of strong opposition from Cardinal Edward Egan", "print_page": "14", "word_count": 351, "_id": "4fd258788eb7c8105d80410c", "snippet": "A federal trial judge in Washington State ruled this week that a local family-owned drugstore chain had engaged in unlawful sex discrimination by excluding contraceptive coverage from its employee health plan.

Mrs. O'Connor was born in New Britain, CT and resided in Elizabeth, NJ for many years before moving to Meadow Lakes in June of 1996. Mrs. O'Connor is an alumnus of the Oxford School in West Hartford, CT and graduated from Smith College in 1935 before embarking upon a dynamic and illustrious career in business and a life of service to many community organizations. Mrs. O'Connor had a extensive career with IBM Corporation, one which began in 1935 when she was among the first 25 women employed for Sytems Service work and was assigned to the Newark office where she assisted salesmen in serving customers. Mrs. O'Connor later served as Personnel Manager at IBM World Headquarters in NYC and Systems Service Manager for the United States. In 1943 she was promoted to the corporate level as the first woman Assistant Vice President of the Company.
