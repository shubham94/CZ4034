Last week one cigarette manufacturer, Liggett, ended decades of industry solidarity by electing to settle anti-tobacco lawsuits rather than battle on to Armageddon. The Justice Department, abetted by a growing parade of industry whistleblowers, is in hot pursuit of criminal charges against tobacco executives who swore before Congress that they had no idea nicotine was addictive. Tobacco stocks, meanwhile, head south. Is this good news for real? Yes. But a $45 billion industry that has vanquished foes as resourceful as C. Everett Koop and ABC News can never be counted out. Putting the latest tumult into perspective, Michael Pertschuk, the longtime anti-tobacco advocate, notes that while Liggett, the smallest tobacco company, may be settling lawsuits, \"the others have decided they could buy Congress and escape that way.\" More than ever, cash is raining down on Capitol Hill as the tobacco industry fights to neutralize the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal agency keen to regulate tobacco as a drug and to end the marketing of cigarettes to children.", "snippet": "Like the evil empire in its last gasp, Big Tobacco, America's foremost purveyor of last gasps, would finally seem to be tumbling down.
