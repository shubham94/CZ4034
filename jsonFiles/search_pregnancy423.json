In 2007, after designing the bridesmaid dresses for her wedding, she left a Wall Street job to start twobirds, a collection of convertible dresses that bridesmaids could actually wear again. Last year, after giving birth to her first child, she had a similar epiphany, finding a lack of fashionable maternity staples for women to wear post-pregnancy, too. Her 14-piece collection includes mannish silk button-downs and an above-the-knee dress with sexy arm cutouts. For spring there are new pastel dresses and jumpsuits, all good looks for stylish moms-to-be eager to maintain their cool.
