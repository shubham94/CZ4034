{"status": "OK", "response": {"docs": [{"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "lead_paragraph": "I have come to the realization that I will almost certainly die of AIDS. I have wavered on that point. When the disease was first diagnosed in early 1991, I was sure I would die - and soon. I was facing brain surgery; the surgeons discovered an infection often fates in four months. I would shortly develop pheumonia, than blood clots. I was hospitalized four times over five months. But by the end of that year, I thought differently. My health rebounded, almost certainly because of AZT. I was doing so well; I really might beat it. Now, it is clear I will not. You can beat the statistics only so long. Mt T-cell count, which was only 2 when I got my diagnosis, has never gone above 30 - a dangerously low level. I have lived longer than the median survival time by 10 months. The treatments simply are not there. They are not even in the pipeline. A miracle is possible, of course. And for a long time, I though one would happen. But let's face it, a miracle isn't going to happen. One day soon I will simply become one of the 90 people in America to die that day of AIDS. It's like knowing I will be killed by a speeding car, but not knowing when or where. I used to be an exception in my H.I.V. support group, the only one of its eight members who was not merely infected with the virus but who had advanced to full-blown AIDS. Now, just a year and a half later, the exception in my group is the one person who does not have AIDS. All the rest of us have deteriorated with the hallmarks of the disease -- a seizure, Kaposi's sarcoma, pneumonia. Our weekly meetings simmer with desperation: We are getting sicker. I am getting sicker. Time is running out. Once AIDS was a hot topic in America -- promising treatments on the horizon, intense media interest, a political battlefield. Now, 12 years after it was first recognized as a new disease, AIDS has become normalized, part of the landscape. It is at once everywhere and nowhere, the leading cause of death among young men nationwide, but little threat to the core of American political power, the white heterosexual suburbanite. No cure or vaccine is in sight. And what small treatment advances had been won are now crumbling. The world is moving on, uncaring, frustrated and bored, leaving by the roadside those of us who are infected and who can't help but wonder: Whatever happened to AIDS? As a journalist who has written about this disease for five years, and as a patient who has had it for nearly as long, I went out looking for answers. THE DISEASE AND THE DOCTORS DR. ANTHONY S. FAUCI SPEAKS WITH A HINT of a Brooklyn accent, which is out of sync with the elegance of his appearance -- well tailored, tidy, trim. At 52, he is scientist-cum-celebrity, ridiculed by Larry Kramer in the play \"The Destiny of Me,\" lionized by George Bush in the 1988 Presidential debate as a hero. Being the Government's point man on AIDS has made Tony Fauci (rhymes with OUCH-ee) famous. He professes to be solely the scientist. But in fact, he is very much the star and the politician, one year defending modest Reagan-Bush AIDS budget proposals as adequate, the next defending generous Clinton proposals as necessary. He is the activist's enemy -- \"Murderer!\" Kramer once called him in an essay published in The Village Voice. He is the activist's friend, a comrade in arms, showing up last October at the opening of the Kramer play wearing a red AIDS ribbon. Fauci's starring AIDS role comes from the many hats he wears -- among them director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and director of the National Institutes of Health's Office of AIDS Research. \"Fauci deserves a lot of the blame for where we are on AIDS,\" said Peter Staley of TAG, the activist Treatment Action Group. But others say that is not fair. \"You can't blame any one person,\" said Gregg Gonsalves, who wrote TAG's report on the status of AIDS research. \"We've gotten to the edge of a scientific cliff.\" Whatever Fauci's faults, I have never doubted his commitment. Still, he is the face of the AIDS scientific community, and 12 years into the disease there are only temporary treatments that work for a few years at most. AIDS remains a fatal illness. Approximately a million Americans are believed to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, the key component of AIDS, and virtually all of them are expected to develop the disease eventually. Close to half a million Americans are expected to have full-blown AIDS by the end of next year; more than 200,000 have already died. Roughly 350,000 will have died by the end of 1994. The World Health Organization puts the number infected worldwide at more than 13 million adults and an additional 1 million or more children. So far, the only treatments are nucleoside analogues, drugs like AZT, DDC and DDI. A fourth nucleoside analogue, D4T, is expected to be approved by the spring. Fauci has focused national research efforts on these analogues, which slow the virus by fooling it with a decoy of genetic material it needs to reproduce. But the analogues have problems. They are highly toxic, and the virus, which mutates rapidly, eventually catches on to the deception. Everyone knew going into the international AIDS conference in Berlin in June that the nucleoside analogues were of limited use, but the horrible surprise was just how limited. A report issued just before the meeting -- the Concorde Study, conducted in England, France and Ireland -- found that, contrary to the recommendations of the United States Government, use of AZT before the onset of AIDS symptoms did not necessarily prolong life. (In an extraordinary action, a United States Government panel has since pulled back the earlier recommendation. AZT is still recommended for those with full-blown AIDS. But the panel left it for patients and their doctors to decide on earlier use.) A subsequent Australian study, published in July, found that AZT, used early, did prolong life. I have always felt that it has prolonged mine. Still, what makes the fuss over AZT so stunning is not just that the drug has shortcomings -- almost everyone knew that from the start. It is that AZT, flawed as it was, had become the Gold Standard of treatment, against which other therapies were being measured. The chilling message of the AZT dispute is this: Things are not just failing to get better; they are getting worse. We are losing ground. \"The fallout from Berlin has been devastating,\" said Martin Delaney, founding director of Project Inform, an AIDS treatment information and lobbying group. \"There were no surprises. But the risk now is that AIDS gets put up on the shelf along with a lot of other long-term unresolved problems. We lose the urgency for money and the scientific momentum.\" The bad news has left drug companies scrambling. Last spring things were so desperate that a group of 15 announced they would pool research data. Many scientists -- and activists -- are fed up with the drug companies, which seem hellbent on pursuing more nucleoside analogues when the real future of AIDS treatment probably lies with gene therapy. The idea is to alter the genetic structure of cells to make them inhospitable to H.I.V. But the problem is, no one knows how to translate the occasional test-tube success into a workable treatment. In addition, most of the gene therapies are being developed by small biotechnology companies that will take years to get into full production. So, was all the time and money spent on the nucleoside analogues wasted? Fauci, who obviously has an investment in the answer, was emphatic that it wasn't. \"People say the Berlin meeting was so depressing, nothing's happening,\" Fauci said in his office overlooking the N.I.H. campus in Bethesda, Md. \"I say that's not the way science works. There are little steps, building blocks. What's important is whether you're going in the right direction, and I am convinced that we are. \"Was it grossly inappropriate to do the extensive studies of AZT and DDI?\" he continued. \"No. Should we have done more with other drugs? If we had them, one could say, yes. \"Let's say a year and a half from now, nevirapine isn't working,\" Fauci said of an experimental drug undergoing trials in combination with the nucleoside analogues. \"Somebody's going to say, 'Why did you waste all that time with it?' But you don't know it doesn't work until you test it.\" If Fauci is defensive, it may be because he is still smarting from a political bruising. His Office of AIDS Research has been reorganized by the Clinton Administration and he has been, in effect, ousted -- done in by the AIDS activists through their Democratic friends in Congress. And while some of his time is being diverted to playing politics, in his own laboratory research he has now returned to basics -- Square 1 -- where many AIDS researchers are working. Fauci is studying the pathogenesis of the disease, its route through the body. I asked him the obvious: 12 years into the disease -- shouldn't we know that already? \"More effort looking at pathogenesis might have been appropriate in retrospect,\" Fauci responded. \"But we were constantly being diverted -- by the activists, by Congress. It was: 'What can you give me right now? Get those drugs out there as quickly as you can.' \" Not so long ago we believed that if we just could find enough money, we could make the disease manageable, like diabetes. But in a further sign of how little hope exists these days in the scientific community, money isn't seen as the main issue anymore. \"Certainly, there are more scientific opportunities than there are resources to fulfill them,\" Fauci said, echoing the views of other scientists. \"But should we dump billions into AIDS research now? I think we'd reach a point of diminishing returns.\" Fauci presents a front of optimism, at least for me. After all, there is no cure for any virus, only vaccines to prevent them -- measles is an example. By the year 2000, he predicted, \"We'll be into vaccine trials that show a vaccine is much more feasible than we thought, though we may not have the best vaccine by then.\" Other scientists are unconvinced. They point out that the rapid mutation of the AIDS virus and its many strains make development of a vaccine difficult. \"The public is frustrated; it says, 'You've been working on this for 10 years,' \" said Dr. Irvin S. Y. Chen, director of the AIDS Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. Chen bemoaned the lack of money for biomedical research in general, which he said was discouraging the best and the brightest from entering the field. \"We're in that in-between stage,\" said Dr. Merle A. Sande, an AIDS expert at the University of California at San Francisco; he was head of the Government panel on AZT use. \"We know a lot about the virus, but we just don't seem able to translate that knowledge into significant treatment advances. It's incredibly frustrating.\" Still, the frustration of the public and the scientists is nothing compared with the frustration of those of us living with AIDS or H.I.V. Will people still be dying of AIDS in the year 2000? Fauci didn't hesitate for a second before replying, \"I don't think there's any question that will be the case.\" THE ACTIVISTS AND THE GOVERNMENT TIM BAILEY WAS ONE OF THE MARYS, AND THAT'S AS close to Act Up royalty as anybody can get. The Marys are a subgroup of Act Up, the group involved in the more radical demonstrations, like disrupting services at St. Patrick's Cathedral. When Bailey died in June at 35, stipulating that he wanted a political funeral in Washington, Act Up was obliged to comply. So on a drizzly Thursday at 7 A.M., two buses filled with Act Up members set out from New York. They were to rendezvous with the body in Washington, then carry the open coffin through the streets from the Capitol to the White House. They would show Bill Clinton the urgency of AIDS. They would bring one of its carcasses to his doorstep. But it was not to be. The police would not let them march, and the day turned into a sodden fiasco, as the police and activists quarreled over the body, shoving the coffin in and out of a van parked in front of the Capitol. The rage was there, but the organization was not. And when the police said no, where did Act Up members run for help but the White House, the very target of their protest, getting Bob Hattoy, a White House staff member with AIDS, to intervene. In the end, Act Up members gave up and went home, taking the body with them. It was a perfect metaphor for the state of AIDS activism -- raging in desperate but unfocused anger, one foot on the inside, one on the outside. The AIDS movement was built on grass-roots efforts. Now those efforts are in disarray. Many Act Up leaders have died. The group's very existence was based on the belief that AIDS could be cured quickly if only enough money and effort were thrown at it -- something that now seems increasingly in doubt. Besides, it is hard to maintain attacks against a Government that is seeking big increases in AIDS spending. Much of the cream of Act Up has fled, forming groups like TAG and joining mainstream AIDS organizations like the Gay Men's Health Crisis and the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Those left behind are Act Up's hard core. Act Up was always part theater, part group therapy. Now, sadly, Act Up is increasingly reduced to burying its dead. To say all that is not to belittle the accomplishments of the group. One reason for Act Up's decline is that it has got so much of what it wanted. Act Up forced AIDS into the Presidential race, dogging candidates. Because of Act Up the price of AZT is lower. Drugs are approved more quickly. Today it is a given that the communities affected by a disease have a voice, and must be consulted. To a great extent, Act Up deserves much of the credit for the increasing political power of the entire gay rights movement. But now even the gay movement has pushed AIDS to the sidelines. Anyone questioning how AIDS ranks as an issue among gay groups need only look to the march on Washington on April 25. Six years earlier, in 1987, a similar gay march had one overriding theme: AIDS. If there was a dominant theme last April, it was homosexuals in the military. To be sure, AIDS was an element of the march, but just an element. Speaker after speaker ignored it. \"It's like they are waiting for us to die so they can get on with their agenda,\" said Dr. Nicholas A. Rango, the director of New York State's AIDS Institute, a gay man who himself has AIDS and watched the march on C-Span from his Manhattan hospital bed. [ He died on Nov. 10. ] Torie Osborn, formerly executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, argued that the shift was inevitable with the election of a Democratic President, renewed attacks from the right wing and just plain burnout. Increasingly, many homosexuals, especially those who test negative for H.I.V., do not want a disease to be what defines their community. \"There is a deep yearning to broaden the agenda beyond AIDS,\" she said. \"There's a natural need for human beings who are in deep grieving to reach for a future beyond their grieving. \"It's one thing to be fighting for treatment, believing you're going to get a cure that will have everyone survive,\" continued Osborn, who recently buried three friends who had died of AIDS. \"But it's an incredibly depressing truth that AIDS has become part of the backdrop of gay life.\" What is to some a broadening of the gay agenda, however, is to others desertion. \"It's one thing for the politicians to abandon AIDS,\" Kevin Frost, a TAG member, said. \"But for our own community to abandon the issue. . . . Who brought this issue of gays in the military out in the open? A couple of flashy queers with checkbooks. Well, what about AIDS?\" What about AIDS? Perhaps the greatest development affecting Act Up, the activist community and the entire AIDS care world is the changing face of the disease. Homosexual sex still accounts for the majority of cases, 57 percent. But that number is dropping, down from 61 percent in 1989. Meanwhile, the percentage of cases tied to intravenous drug use is beginning to climb. It is now at 23 percent, up from 21 percent in 1989. Black and Hispanic groups are clamoring for a greater role in running AIDS care organizations. Their intentions seem genuine -- what do gay groups know of inner-city drug use? -- but also seem driven in part by a desire for money and power. In an age of Government cutbacks, AIDS is where the money is -- \"today's equivalent of the Great Society programs of the 60's,\" as Rango put it. In Washington and Houston, gay groups and black and Hispanic groups are bickering over who should control the money and the programs. In New York, the largest AIDS care organization, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, is trying valiantly to be all things to all constituencies -- it contributed $25,000 to the lobbying effort to allow homosexuals in the military even as it was helping to expand legal services in Harlem. Inevitably, focus is lost. G.M.H.C. has recently changed executive directors, as have many of the more than 3,500 AIDS organizations in the United States. The average executive director of an AIDS service group lasts less than two years, burned out by depression and exhausted by the bickering among AIDS constituencies. \"We should be fighting the virus, not each other,\" said Dan Bross, the executive director of the AIDS Action Council. \"We're eating our young.\" MARY FISHER, WHO ADDRESSED THE REPUBLICAN National Convention in Houston as a woman infected with H.I.V., whom I interviewed at the time and who has since become a friend, also believes the AIDS movement is adrift. She was sitting at lunch in Manhattan with Larry Kramer, both of them bemoaning the state of AIDS activism. \"We need to agree on the goals,\" Fisher said. \"That's just rhetoric,\" Kramer shot back. \"The goal is to find a cure.\" Fisher sees AIDS entering a dangerous never-never land, with the day fast approaching when no one will be carrying the AIDS banner. \"The gay community is going to stop screaming,\" she said. \"It is already stopping.\" \"I'm very despondent,\" Kramer said. \"You don't know where to yell or who to yell at. Clinton says all the right things, then doesn't do anything.\" Indeed, the Clinton Administration does say all the right things, at times coming close to being patronizing about it. \"I have a real understanding that the people who feel the strongest about this, they don't have time,\" Carol H. Rasco, the President's top domestic policy adviser, said in defense of the zealotry of Act Up. \"When a bomb is ticking inside you, you have to keep pushing.\" Where once Washington doors were closed to AIDS activists, they are now open. Indeed, perhaps the single biggest AIDS change in Washington under the Clinton Administration has been one of tone. AIDS sufferers are no longer treated as immoral lepers. David Barr, director of treatment education and advocacy for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, recalled a May meeting with Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. \"She agreed to everything we wanted,\" Barr said. \"I was amazed. We're so used to doing battle. But is it a ploy?\" Certainly Bill Clinton is a vast improvement over George Bush. The President proposed a major increase in spending on AIDS research, about 20 percent, coming up with an additional $227 million. That would raise the total N.I.H. spending on AIDS research to $1.3 billion. In aid for outpatient care, the White House proposed a giant increase in what is known as Ryan White money, named for the Midwestern teen-ager who died of AIDS in April 1990. The current appropriation is $348 million, which the Administration proposed to nearly double by adding $310 million. The House didn't add the entire amount, just a $200 million increase, but it still brought the total to $548 million. The Senate was slightly more generous, and the final appropriation was $579 million. But is more money enough? AIDS activists say they want leadership, but they are not sure anymore what that means. \"It was much easier,\" said Torie Osborn, \"when we could hate George Bush and Ronald Reagan, when we thought we had evil genocidal Republican Presidents who weren't doing what needed to be done to get a cure.\" Still, as is so often the case with Bill Clinton, he is a victim of his own lofty campaign rhetoric. He spoke eloquently about AIDS in his pitches for the gay vote. He insisted that people infected with the AIDS virus, Bob Hattoy and Elizabeth Glaser, speak at the Democratic National Convention. On Election Night, he mentioned AIDS high in his victory speech. It all seemed so promising. David B. Mixner, a Clinton friend who helped rally the gay vote, exclaimed in the flush of a Clinton victory, \"I believe thousands of my friends who wouldn't make it, who would die of AIDS, might make it now because Bill Clinton is President.\" There it is: the man from Arkansas was to be not just President but savior. He's not. Bogged down early on in a battle over homosexuals in the military, Clinton has grown wary of anything that the public might perceive as a gay issue. He delayed fulfilling his campaign pledge to name an AIDS czar, finally naming her five months into his term -- and only when the National Commission on AIDS was about to attack him for not providing leadership on the epidemic. More than anything else, what the AIDS community wants from Bill Clinton is a sense of urgency. Carol Rasco maintains that Clinton is committed. \"Health-care reform and AIDS are the only things I've worked on every day since I got here,\" said the domestic policy adviser. But others, even in the Administration, think Clinton is doing little to help. \"Other than myself, who lives with AIDS every day, there's no one at the White House for whom this is their first-tier issue,\" said Bob Hattoy, who, after serving six months as a White House aide often critical of the Administration's AIDS policies, was shifted to the Interior Department. He praised the President and Mrs. Clinton for having \"a profoundly sensitive awareness about AIDS,\" but at the staff level, he said, \"AIDS is not on the radar screens at the White House every day.\" And the political advisers? Hattoy scoffed. \"I don't think they'll address AIDS until the Perot voters start getting it.\" THE CZAR AND THE PRESS THERE WAS A TIME when it was thought that the solution to the AIDS crisis could be found in two words: AIDS czar. One omnipotent public figure with the power to marshal funds, direct research, cut through the bureaucracy -- in short, to lead a Manhattan Project-size effort to force a cure for AIDS. Kristine M. Gebbie doesn't look like a czar, and she doesn't think of herself as one, either. At 50, she has the air of the head nurse. There is something at once no-nonsense and fussy about her -- her erect posture, her precise and proper answers, her tendency to correct an interviewer's questions. She is what she is -- a nurse who worked her way up through the public-health bureaucracy, a divorced mother of three children, who has willed herself to a better lot in life. In 1978 she became the chief health officer of Oregon and then, 11 years later, the chief health officer of Washington State. Her experience with AIDS is primarily as a bureaucrat, as chairman of the Centers for Disease Control's advisory panel on H.I.V. prevention and as a member of the National Commission on AIDS. Now, she is the AIDS czar -- a far cry from the stellar names that AIDS activists had fantasized about: H. Norman Schwarzkopf, Jimmy Carter, C. Everett Koop. \"We wanted 'Jurassic Park,' and we got 'Snow White,' \" Larry Kramer likes to say. \"The activists wanted a war on AIDS,\" Gebbie said, shaking her head. \"I am not one of the big names. I am someone who has struggled with systems around this epidemic since the beginning. I think I have a feel for what it takes to bring people together.\" Indeed, asked to give her job description, she responded, \"consensus builder.\" Gebbie, whose official title is national AIDS policy coordinator, sees her job as exactly that -- coordinating the various Federal agencies like Defense and Housing and Education in terms of prevention, care and research. Her goal is to have the agencies themselves take over the assault on AIDS, so she sees hers as a short-term job -- 3 or 5 years, \"10 years tops.\" She expects to take no role in research other than, again, as a coordinator, but not one who independently sets priorities. And what happened to the eagerly awaited Manhattan Project? \"Manhattan Project?\" Gebbie said. \"I don't know what that means. Both the Manhattan Project and the Man-on-the-Moon project involved, I think, a much more targeted goal. We know where we'd like to go -- fix AIDS -- but I'm not sure we can conceptualize what it would take to do that. On the other hand, if what 'Manhattan Project' conveys is: 'The Government is behind you,' well, if I do my job right, we will target and have energy and direction. What we won't have is somebody in general's stripes who can walk around and order people, 'Drop what you're doing and work on H.I.V.' \" Gebbie advocates distributing condoms to sexually active teen-agers, though not necessarily in the schools. She supports supplying clean needles to drug addicts. She backs \"in extreme cases and only as a very last resort\" the isolation of people infected with H.I.V. who continue to be sexually irresponsible. \"It might be in a hospital or a group home,\" she said. And she advocates, in theory, and with full civil rights protection, the reporting of names of those with H.I.V. as a public-health technique for making sure connections are made to their partners for counseling and possible treatment. Kristine Gebbie was not at the top of the Administration's list of candidates for AIDS czar. Most of the medical and private-sector leaders who were approached said they had withdrawn their names for personal reasons. Yet it was clear that they did not regard the post as the all-powerful one it might have been. \"There's this contradiction,\" said Dr. Mark D. Smith, a San Francisco AIDS expert who discussed the job with the Administration but eventually withdrew, \"between the public perception of great responsibility and the reality of no real organizational authority.\" Most of those considered said, however, that they might have taken the job as AIDS adviser to the President if Clinton himself had called to convince them. But he didn't. The $112,000-a-year position, which does not require Senate confirmation, was offered to Gebbie in a phone call from Rasco. Gebbie never met the President until the morning of the June 25 news conference to announce her appointment. To be fair, on that sunny Friday in the Rose Garden when he announced the appointment of Gebbie, the President sounded like the old Bill Clinton, the one in the campaign. He finally did what the activists wanted -- he spoke out on AIDS as President. He labeled the virus \"one of the most dreaded and mysterious diseases humanity has ever known\" and \"an epidemic that has already claimed too many of our brothers and sisters, our parents and children, our friends and colleagues.\" But the trouble was, no one was listening. Newspapers and the networks reported the naming of Gebbie. But few carried the President's comments on AIDS. Newsweek magazine, in a week-in-the-life-of-the-President piece, didn't even mention the Gebbie announcement. At the news conference, there was only one question on AIDS, and that was directed to Gebbie about her qualifications. Reporters were eager to move on to the real news, like the budget and homosexuals in the military. AIDS, it seems, had become old news. \"In the early days of AIDS, when knowledge was expanding, there were lots of very compelling things to write about,\" said Marlene Cimons, who covers AIDS and Federal health policy out of the Washington bureau of The Los Angeles Times. \"We were in the infant stages of making policy decisions about AIDS that had unique social and political ramifications. Now it's become harder to find angles. We've written to death most aspects of the disease: AIDS in the classroom. AIDS in the workplace. Testing. They filled the front pages. Now there's a vacuum.\" Stuart Shear, a reporter for \"The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour\" who covers AIDS, said the conflicts that had made for good stories -- the fights between Republican Administrations and AIDS advocates -- were gone. \"It's become a pure science story,\" he said. \"When it gets down to the clinical nitty-gritty, that's not what we look at. It's hard to get people to come on and complain about an Administration that's increasing funding.\" For her part, Gebbie, who has a budget of just under $3 million and a staff \"of four or five\" -- with 15 to 20 others, she said, in another office -- seems to prefer being in the shadows. Her office will not be in the White House but in a building across the street that houses a McDonald's. \"My guess,\" she said, \"is that the choice of me makes clear that this isn't intended to be somebody who spends all their time outside rousing people up, but somebody who is prepared to spend a lot of time inside making it work. \"It's very clear how many people really did expect miracles,\" Gebbie said. \"When I give what I know are appropriate answers, I know I sound like a bureaucratic stick-in-the-mud: 'This lady is not worth two bits to us; she talks about coordination and cooperation. Blah!' \"But part of my mission,\" Gebbie said matter-of-factly, \"is to help people keep their expectations within reality.\" Gebbie needn't worry. Expectations could hardly be lower. \"People are weary and hopeless and sad -- the researchers, the activists, the care-givers,\" John H. Templeton, director of AIDS educational services at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, told me. \"There is this sense that no matter what you do, it's all going to turn out the same in the end.\" THE PATIENT AND JOURNALIST IN MY INTERVIEWS FOR this article and others, I always ask people with AIDS if they expect to die of the disease. One reason for that is a genuine reporter's curiosity; the answer is part of the profile of who they are. But I am also searching for hope for myself. Increasingly, the answers come back the same, even from the most optimistic of Act Up zealots: Yes, we will die of AIDS. I thought about that the other day in the emergency room at Lenox Hill Hospital. I had taken my boyfriend there for a blood transfusion to offset the anemia caused by the chemotherapy for his Kaposi's sarcoma. I realized on that Sunday morning in the emergency room that the moment of crisis wasn't coming tomorrow or the next day for my boyfriend. It was here today. And it will soon be here today for me, too. Does that make me angry? Yes. I had such hope when I interviewed Bill Clinton about AIDS and gay issues for this magazine in August 1992. He spoke so eloquently on AIDS. I really did see him as a white knight who might save me. How naive I was to think that one man could make that big a difference. At its core, the problem isn't a government; it's a virus. Still, in interviews with researchers and Administration officials, it was clear that we are talking from different planets. I need help now, not five years from now. Yet the urgency just wasn't there. Compassion and concern, yes; even sympathy. But urgency, no. I felt alone, abandoned, cheated. I asked Gebbie what she says to someone with AIDS -- in other words, what she says to me. And for one brief moment, there was a glimmer of realization that delay means death. \"I say, 'I hear you and I appreciate the frustration and the sorrow and the loneliness,' \" she said. \"That can sound trite, but it is genuine. It's inappropriate for me to hold out a false promise to you. It would be easy to say: 'There, there. It will be better soon.' That's a disservice, so I have to be honest with you. We don't have quick answers. I can't tell you when we're going to have a cure.\" I am on the cutting edge of drug testing, in a trial at New York Hospital for a new combination therapy: AZT, DDI and nevirapine. That is the combination that drew so much publicity last February when researchers in Boston declared that they had found the combination was effective in inhibiting the virus. But at the Berlin conference, the formulator of the concept, Yung-Kang Chow, a Harvard medical student, reported a flaw in part of the original study. Other researchers challenged the findings after they were unable to confirm the results. I was surprised at how jealous many of my fellow members of the support group were when I got into the trial -- 1 of only 25 people accepted out of more than 400 applicants. The group members felt that I had used influence. I had not. Yet admission to these trials is not purely luck, either -- a point driven home when a number of leading researchers called, offering to get me into one of the nevirapine trials. I did not take them up on it. If my doctors used influence to get me in, it was not with my knowledge. But I am grateful if they did. The ship is beginning to sink; the water is lapping onto the deck. I am eager for any lifeboat, however leaky. The letters pour in from readers who know I have AIDS, which I wrote about in this newspaper last December. A Florida woman wrote detailing her son's agonizing death from AIDS. Halfway through the letter, she caught herself, suddenly blurting out, \"I don't know why I am writing this to you.\" Like so many of the letters, it was really not so much for me as for the writer, an excuse to open up her heart and let out the pain. She ended with a line I think of often, a line as much for her dead son, also named Jeffrey, as for me. \"I intend this letter,\" she wrote, \"as a mother's hug.\" Hardly a day goes by without my getting a letter or call from someone who has the cure for AIDS. Many are crackpots. But others, I'm not so sure. Perhaps I will soon be desperate enough to pursue them. More and more of the letters are nasty, even cruel. They are still the minority, but they make clear how deep the resentment runs against the attention given AIDS. \"As an average American,\" a man from Brooklyn wrote in a letter to the editor that made its way to me, \"I cannot feel compassion for those who contracted AIDS through the pleasures of homosexuality, promiscuity or drug injection. The advent of the AIDS sickness in the world breaks my heart -- but only for those who contracted it from blood transfusion, medical skin pricks or birth.
