But if the label says simply ''Dry-Clean Only,'' coin-operated machines are fine. Dry cleaning usually entails the use of a solvent, like petroleum, perchlorethylene or fluorocarbon, to remove soil, then tumble-drying at a high temperature and finally steaming. The difference between the coin-operated machines and a professional dry cleaner is that the professional can modify the process according to new label directions.", "snippet": "IF the label on a new pair of trousers says ''Professionally Dry-Clean Only,'' they should not be taken to a coin-operated dry-cleaning machine.

Not one to let such an oversight spoil her dinner, Mrs. Gussow reaches into the basket and tears off a portion of bleached-white, fiber-poor, vitamin-depleted (yet oddly satisfying) Italian bread. She smears a thin coating of butter over it. The incident is startling. Mrs. Gussow along with an obesity specialist and a high-blood pressure expert had been invited to three popular New York restaurants to discuss whether wholesome eating is possible in restaurants. Each expert analyzed menus through the lens of his or her specialty and was asked to give advice to average, health-conscious diners, many of whom see restaurant menus as mine fields, with danger lurking behind every tempting dish. Can one enjoy dining without asking the kitchen to hold salt, sugar, sauce, beef and butter?", "snippet": "''LOOK, there's no whole wheat bread in that basket,'' exclaims Joan Gussow, professor of nutrition and education at Teachers College at Columbia University, taking in the scene at Marcello, an East Side Italian restaurant.
