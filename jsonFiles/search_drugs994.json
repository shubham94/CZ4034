Total health expenditures are expected to rise from $1 trillion in 1996 to $2.1 trillion by 2007, jumping from 13.6 percent of gross domestic product to 16.6 percent. That is likely to translate into much higher health insurance premium increases than has been the case in recent years. These numbers are discouraging, particularly since the projections do not even reach the years when baby boomers will begin utilizing health care intensively in their late 60's and 70's. The relatively low growth in spending of the past four years is actually an aberration from long-term trends, made possible by a rapid shift of American workers into managed-care plans from costly fee-for-service plans where there were few constraints on what doctors and hospitals could charge or patients could request. Many economists have said for some time, however, that this tamping down of costs is a one-time effect achieved mostly by getting price discounts out of hospital systems and squeezing down doctors' fees.", "headline": {"main": "Rising Costs in Health Care"}, "abstract": "Editorial comments on report by Department of Health and Human Services predicting that growth in health care spending will increase substantially over next 10 years; says shift toward managed care has produced a few good years of relatively stable costs, but has not reduced problem of uninsured (M)", "print_page": "28", "word_count": 370, "_id": "4fd20b078eb7c8105d7789b6", "snippet": "A report by economists at the Department of Health and Human Services predicts that growth in health-care spending will increase substantially over the next 10 years.
