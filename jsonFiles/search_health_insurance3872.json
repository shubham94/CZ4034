After rallying late last week, small-company shares faltered, leaving the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks below its level of a week earlier. The index fell 4.16 points, or 1 percent, to 411.64. [Page D8.] Treasury bond yields fell to one-month lows on expectations that Asian financial turmoil would bolster demand at the Treasury's $37 billion quarterly debt sale this week. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 2/32 , or 67.5 cents per $1,000 bond, to 1076/32 , nudging its yield down a basis point to 5.62 percent.

[A14.] A New State Lure: Wage Rebates The competition among states and even Mexico to attract companies has spawned a new incentive, one strikingly uncharacteristic for a market economy: wage rebates. For example, Whirlpool will get back 4.5 cents of every dollar paid in wages to the 1,100 workers it hired for a stove factory in Tulsa, Okla.

The decrease averages three-tenths of 1 percent, or about $61, from comparably equipped 1998 models. The prices of Ford's highest-volume cars, the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, will fall by $1,000 to $1,800.

[B1.] China's Firm Stance on the Yuan Asian markets have seesawed as traders play on concerns that China, like the Asian nations roiled by financial crisis, will reduce the value of its currency, the yuan. But China's leaders have repeatedly promised they will not, and the traders overlook the fact that China responds more to politics than to market pressure. News Analysis.
