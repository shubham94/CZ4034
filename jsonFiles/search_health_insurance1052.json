The treatment, platelet-rich plasma therapy, or P.R.P., involves centrifuging a person's own blood until it contains a concentrated mix of plasma cells and growth factors and then injecting the resulting substance directly into the injured tissue. In theory, the distilled growth factors (a protein or substance that helps stimulate growth) should speed healing and improve the tissue's health, which has happened in the lab. When scientists surgically created lesions in animal tendons and other tissues, P.R.P. therapy nudged the injured tissues to rapidly create new collagen and blood vessels. Meanwhile, testimonials from professional athletes suggested that the shots work in humans as well. Today, recreational athletes reportedly clamor for P.R.P. to treat everything from tennis elbow to back pain, even though the procedure rarely is covered by insurance and can cost $1,000 a shot. \"It has buzz,\" said Dennis Cardone, a clinical associate professor at New York University's Langone Medical Center who has written about the use of P.R.P. in sports medicine.", "headline": {"main": "Phys Ed: Does Platelet-Rich Plasma Therapy Really Work?", "kicker": "Well"}, "abstract": "Recent studies cast doubt on whether platelet-rich plasma therapy - the expensive and controversial treatment known as P.R.P. - actually helps in the recovery of sports injuries.", "print_page": null, "word_count": 926, "_id": "4fd39e518eb7c8105d8e0d9c", "snippet": "Recent studies cast doubt on whether platelet-rich plasma therapy - the expensive and controversial treatment known as P.R.P. - actually helps in the recovery of sports injuries.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/phys-ed-does-platelet-rich-plasma-therapy-really-work/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}, {"value": "Medicine and Health", "name": "subject", "rank": "2"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Gretchen", "lastname": "REYNOLDS"}], "original": "By GRETCHEN REYNOLDS"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2011-01-26T00:01:44Z", "section_name": "Health"}, {"type_of_material": "Text", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Washington", "lead_paragraph": "A transcript of President Obama\u2019s second State of the Union address, as released by the White House on Tuesday.", "headline": {"main": "Obama\u2019s Second State of the Union (Text)", "kicker": "Text", "print_headline": "Obama's Second State of the Union (text)", "content_kicker": "Text"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "", "word_count": "7051", "_id": "5111301100315214fbb894b0", "snippet": "A transcript of President Obama\u2019s second State of the Union address, as released by the White House on Tuesday.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/us/politics/26obama-text.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "Politics", "keywords": [], "byline": [], "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2011-01-26T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "U.S."}, {"type_of_material": "Op-Ed", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Date night, they called this State of the Union address.
