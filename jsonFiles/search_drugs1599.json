These were among the conclusions drawn by Jill Niedermeier, a 25-year-old science and health educator at Tomlinson Middle School in Fairfield, Conn., who has been teaching in public schools for two years and took an opportunity to reflect upon the strengths and weaknesses of her training. Miss Niedermeier received her teacher education at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven, where she took a variety of liberal arts, science and teaching-methods courses that led to a B.S. degree in health education and certification to teach health and basic sciences from kindergarten through 12th grade. She entered teaching, she said, because she had felt in high school that she could improve upon the methods she had experienced during her own school days in Fairfield, an affluent bedroom community on Long Island Sound where she grew up. Miss Niedermeier also based her conclusions on teaching experiences in inner-city schools in Bridgeport and Meriden, both blue-collar towns in Connecticut.", "headline": {"main": "A TEACHER'S REPORT CARD ON TRAINING"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "43", "word_count": 1170, "_id": "4fd144458eb7c8105d61dcc3", "snippet": "NEW teachers need more training to understand the special needs both of the growing number of foreign-born children in public schools and of children whose parents are divorced.

Other recent experiments here and abroad have shown that the two hemispheres of the brain influence the immune defenses in different ways and that some brain chemicals have specific effects on immune cells. It has long been known that the body's two most important windows on the outside world are the brain and immune defense system. Everything we hear, feel, see or imagine comes through the brain.
