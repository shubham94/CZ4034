I have Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune condition of the thyroid, the gland that regulates the body's energy and metabolism. It's a common disease, one in six women will develop it in their lifetime, and it's usually relatively easy to detect, by testing for high levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH. But usually isn't always, and it can often go undetected for years and is most commonly diagnosed after age 40.", "headline": {"kicker": "AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES", "main": "Plenty of Symptoms, But Not Many Clues"}, "word_count": 983, "blog": [], "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd25c7d8eb7c8105d809f9b"}], "meta": {"hits": 11, "time": 55, "offset": 10}}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
