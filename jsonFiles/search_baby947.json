The authors of the study said the results indicated that ultrasound should be used more selectively. The six-year, $7 million study found the same rate of early deliveries and low-weight babies among women who received routine ultrasound at 15 to 22 weeks gestation and again at 31 to 35 weeks and women who received no ultrasound screening. The study also showed the same rate of fetal defects at birth, totaling 5 percent for both groups. All the women in the study had no indications of complications at the beginning of their pregnancies.", "headline": {"main": "STUDY FINDS WASTE IN ULTRASOUND USE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "17", "word_count": 855, "_id": "4fd1ac638eb7c8105d6cbae5", "snippet": "The routine use of prenatal ultrasound screening does not improve the outcome of pregnancies for low-risk women, according to the results of a study of 15,530 low-risk pregnancies, the largest ever conducted on prenatal ultrasound screening.
