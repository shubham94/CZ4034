Burger, is heating up. Opponents of the bill thought last November that they had enough votes to keep it bottled up in the Senate Judiciary committee, but on Monday a somewhat unusual meeting was organized by supporters. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the chief sponsor, invited Justices William H. Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor to a conference in the Capitol with members of the Judiciary Committee. Both Justices are on the record in support of the legislation for the new court. Sources said Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the Judiciary chairman, and Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, who had reportedly been leaning against the bill, were present. Other committee members were invited but could not make it.", "snippet": "The Congressional battle over    creation of an intercircuit   tribunal just below the Supreme Court, a favorite project of Chief Justice Warren E.
