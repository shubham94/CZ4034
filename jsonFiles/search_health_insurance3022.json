For several hours a day, he sat in his white lab coat before a white table in the center of the room, mixing powders and creams in a sterile compartment beneath a ventilator hood. The labor, though humdrum, required great dexterity and care: smoothing gritty chemicals into paste, drawing precise dosages of toxins into saline solutions and, in the end, creating medications from scratch. For nostalgia-prone types in the pharmacy profession, drug compounding was something of a lost art, conjuring up images of cloaked and bearded apothecaries hunched over foaming test tubes. Such romantic notions held no sway over Robert Courtney. He was, at the bottom of his soul, a man of commerce. His customers at Research Medical Tower Pharmacy in Kansas City, Mo., had no inkling of this. After Courtney would emerge from the sterile compounding room with their medications in hand, he greeted them with an Old World civility that complemented his fastidious haircut and the crisply professional dress beneath his lab coat. ''What a gentleman,'' Delia Chelston exclaimed to her husband after the pharmacist offered her a seat while he filled her prescription. Through her oncologist, Chelston also received from Courtney's pharmacy the chemotherapy medication known as Taxol, which she was taking to battle ovarian cancer. By early 2001, it dawned on her that she had been experiencing none of the drug's crippling side effects. After considering the spectrum of possibilities, Chelston did as most cancer patients would. She took the Taxol's seeming benignness as an encouraging sign that she was defeating the odds.", "headline": {"main": "The Toxic Pharmacist"}, "abstract": "Richard Draper profiles Robert Courtney, Kansas City, Mo, pharmacist found guilty of diluting medications and pocketing profits to support opulent lifestyle; photos (L)", "print_page": "83", "word_count": 3058, "_id": "4fd23fc98eb7c8105d7d6f67", "snippet": "He worked in an obscure little room, 9 feet by 9 feet.

As a Republican, I have served as a cabinet member (once), a presidential commission member (three times), an all-purpose political ombudsman (many times) and a relentless crusader whom some would call a crank (throughout). Among the bedrock principles that the Republican Party has stood for since its origins in the 1850's is the principle of fiscal stewardship -- the idea that government should invest in posterity and safeguard future generations from unsustainable liabilities. It is a priority that has always attracted me to the party. At various times in our history (especially after wars), Republican leaders have honored this principle by advocating and legislating painful budgetary retrenchment, including both spending cuts and tax hikes. Over the last quarter century, however, the Grand Old Party has abandoned these original convictions. Without ever renouncing stewardship itself -- indeed, while talking incessantly about legacies, endowments, family values and leaving ''no child behind'' -- the G.O.P. leadership has by degrees come to embrace the very different notion that deficit spending is a sort of fiscal wonder drug.
