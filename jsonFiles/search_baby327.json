You already know that a baby with poor sleep habits means misery for you and doesn't seem like much fun for him or her. But this year, evidence emerged that those sleepless nights may also be a sign of bigger troubles to come. According to a new study, erratic sleep patterns in the first 18 months of life correlate at age 2 with reduced ''executive functioning'' -- the term psychologists use to refer to the ability to focus your thoughts, control your impulses and avoid distractions. And executive-function abilities in childhood, recent research has determined, predict future success in school and in life. Annie Bernier, a psychologist at the University of Montreal; Stephanie M. Carlson, a psychologist at the University of Minnesota; and two colleagues followed 60 families with new babies, and at 12 and 18 months asked them to keep a ''sleep diary'' tallying how many hours the babies slept at night and during the day. (They decided not to use total hours slept as their measure of sleep quality, because babies gradually need less sleep as they grow. Instead, the researchers postulated that sleeping more hours at night and fewer during the day, as older children do, was a sign of better, more ''mature'' sleep patterns in infants.)", "headline": {"main": "Infant Sleep Is Destiny"}, "abstract": "Psychologists Annie Bernier of University of Montreal and Stephanie M Carlson of University of Minnesota lead study on sleep habits of babies and impact that sleep deprivation has on executive functioning; research finds that babies who are sleep deprived are more likely to have some reduction in executive-functioning than those babies who get adequate sleep; drawing (M)", "print_page": "46", "word_count": 365, "_id": "4fd28efd8eb7c8105d866032", "snippet": "Attention, anxious parents with sleepless newborns: It's even worse than you think!
