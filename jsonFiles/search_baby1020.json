Whether tracking the mating behavior of frogs in the field, or comparing a gene in a fruit fly with a gene in a human, biologists bear in mind the naturalist's grand theory of how and why all creatures evolve. Now some biologists are proposing that physicians, too, would do well to heed the wisdom of Darwin, and to take the principles of evolution and natural selection into account as they seek to cure their patients. Biologists argue that clinicians often ignore the fundamental concepts of evolution, as when they treat a fever with aspirin, even though fever is a highly effective method that mammals have evolved for combating invasive bacteria.", "headline": {"main": "Biologists Advise Doctors to Think Like Darwin"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2581, "_id": "4fd1d4588eb7c8105d7117cc", "snippet": "FOR many biologists, Charles Darwin is a hero of near-godlike proportions whose ideas are as powerful and piquant today as they were when they were conceived.
