The scarcity of women -- real women, not goddesses or nymphs -- seemed especially surprising, given the healthy size of the female population since classical times. Ms. Kampen was writing in 1976, when the new social thinking of the 1960's was just beginning to reshape our approach to the past. That reshaping is still very much in progress. Although art history continues to be a hero-worshiping, monument-fixated discipline, young scholars have increasingly turned their attention in other, less glamorous directions, sifting through the unprepossessing odds and ends of the distant past to give voice to overlooked lives as ordinary and vitally complex as our own.", "headline": {"main": "Giving Voice to Overlooked Women of Ancient Times", "kicker": "ART REVIEW"}, "abstract": "Holland Cotter reviews exhibit Byzantine Women and Their World, at Harvard's Sackler Museum; photos; show is spinoff from Metropolitan Museum's 1997 exhibit Glory of Byzantium (M)", "print_page": "38", "word_count": 1344, "_id": "4fd241c58eb7c8105d7da4d2", "snippet": "''Silent populations'' was a term used by Natalie Boymel Kampen, an historian of ancient Roman art, for all the people who barely made it into the visual record centuries ago.
