The most observant of her diehard fans had little trouble deciphering the truth: she was three months pregnant. Her baby is due in April. Performing while pregnant isn't such a stretch in other art forms (recently the soprano Jennifer Welch-Babidge, at six months, made her City Opera debut in ''Lucia di Lammermoor''; her pregnancy added a tragic layer to the role of the doomed Lucia). But with the consent of her doctor and the flexibility of her boss -- Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic director -- Ms. Kent performed leads in ''Within You Without You: A Tribute to George Harrison,'' ''Dorian'' and ''Pillar of Fire,'' which features, oddly enough, a spinster heroine who unwittingly knocks herself up. Ms. Kent, 34, who is married to the company's associate artistic director, Victor Barbee, spoke with Gia Kourlas, the dance editor of Time Out New York, about the experience after a class at the company's Lower Broadway studio.", "headline": {"main": "The Ballerina With the Belly", "kicker": "DANCE"}, "abstract": "Interview with ballerina Julie Kent about continuing to dance with American Ballet Theater while pregnant and her plan to return to dancing after baby's birth; photo (M)", "print_page": "6", "word_count": 1294, "_id": "4fd277678eb7c8105d838b1d", "snippet": "JULIE KENT is a waif of a ballerina.

Somebody needed to make a comedy built around all the holiday season hostility that goes up along with the decorations. Mr. Zwigoff and the screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are just the guys for such a task. ''Bad Santa'' takes all the Christmas season's bad vibes and converts them into an achingly funny and corrupt dark comedy. Mr. Thornton is Willie T. Stokes, a burned-out, hard-drinking safecracker who is annually roused from sleeping one off during the most wonderful time of the year by his partner, Marcus (Mr. Cox). As Marcus, a dwarf, works as a department store elf, he also cases the store so that he and Willie can break in and relieve the joint of valuable merchandise. On this tour they have ended up in Phoenix, which just adds to the wealth of hilarious incongruity. As a director, Mr. Zwigoff has a taste for finding the dramatic power of self-loathing and making it entertainment. His previous films -- the documentary ''Crumb'' and his fiction-film debut, ''Ghost World'' -- both hinged on coping with epic tides of depression. ''Bad Santa'' falls directly into that lineage. Willie is filled with the most distorted kind of narcissism imaginable, and for Mr. Thornton it functions as a kind of star chemistry. Willie ladles it generously on the kids who line up to see him on his wobbly perch on Santa's throne: he's the kind of minimum-wage jackal who has sent his victims on to thousands of hours of therapy (Elvis Mitchell).", "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "word_count": 2323, "_id": "4fd2346c8eb7c8105d7c5782", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film.
