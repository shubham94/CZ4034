At age 54, Dr. Snyder has won 29 scientific awards for his research on brain chemistry and published over 700 papers. His curriculum vitae runs 50 pages. He is at the peak of his career. Yet he seems self-effacing, very different from the popular image of the successful scientist as the hard-driving person who lives only to beat the competition. He speaks lovingly of his wife and two grown daughters. Children, he says, are more important than any honors. They \"are why we're here on earth.\" He keeps a couple of music stands in his office so that when his octogenarian father drops by, they can play duets -- his father on the flute and Dr. Snyder on the guitar.", "headline": {"main": "SCIENTIST AT WORK: Solomon Snyder; Brain Researcher Makes It Look Easy"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2066, "_id": "4fd1a86c8eb7c8105d6c46d6", "snippet": "Dr. Solomon Snyder, the soft-spoken director of the department of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, slouches on the sofa in his inner office and speaks of the great passions of his life.
