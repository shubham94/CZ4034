But there is nothing frivolous about her lawsuit against the Xerox Corporation, which declined to hire her 11 years ago because she was seriously overweight. In 1974, Xerox approached Mrs. McDermott, then 56 years old, about a position as a systems analyst in its Rochester headquarters. The offer was contingent, however, upon passing a physical examination, and Mrs. McDermott had problems. She stood 5 feet 6 inches and weighed 249 pounds. The company's health services chief, pointing to what he said was the link between obesity and emotional disturbance and the danger it posed to Xerox's disability and life insurance programs, said she should not be hired unless she lost 90 pounds. This is something Mrs. McDermott, who says she has a thyroid condition, was never able to do.", "snippet": "Catherine McDermott is being a bit facetious when she calls herself ''the Rosa Parks of fat people.''

She also likes fast- food hamburgers, ''the thicker the better.'' In fact, she says, there is no cut of beef that she doesn't like: ''I even fix oxtail soup.'' Talk like this is perhaps to be expected from the 45-year-old Mrs. Smith. She is the president of the National Cattlemen's Association, the first woman chosen to represent the $30-billion beef cattle industry. And one of her major projects for 1985, she said, is to try to convince Americans that beef is healthy. Sitting in the association's Washington office one day in mid-April, she said she realized that many health-conscious Americans associate the words ''red meat'' with such things as obesity, heart disease and cancer. As a result, beef consumption has been declining over the last decade, from 94 pounds per person in 1976 to 79 pounds in 1984. But as Mrs. Smith sees it, beef has gotten a bum rap.", "snippet": "WASHINGTON JO ANN SMITH'S favorite meal is standing rib roast, medium rare, with Yorkshire pudding.
