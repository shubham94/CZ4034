The recommended dietary allowances have been reviewed 10 times since the founding of the academy's food and nutrition board in 1942. The variance for given nutrient levels among committees has been as much as 40 percent. The trend in allowances over the last 40 years has been mostly downward, as new information has refined the safety factor required to meet the nutritional needs of essentially all healthy persons.", "snippet": "To the Editor:   The action of Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, to reject and suppress publication of the 1985 report of the committee on recommended dietary allowances of the academy's food and nutrition board (front page,...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "PRESS, FRANK", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "OLSON, ROBERT E", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "UNITED STATES", "name": "glocations"}, {"value": "SCIENCES, NATIONAL ACADEMY OF", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "DIET AND NUTRITION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "STANDARDS AND STANDARDIZATION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "26", "type_of_material": "Letter", "word_count": 510, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
