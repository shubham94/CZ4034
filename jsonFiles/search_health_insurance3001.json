That switch in status, coupled with the expiration of the drug's main patent protection, has led to a precipitous drop in the drug's retail price -- to roughly $1 for a daily tablet from $3. From a consumer's standpoint, this has been a mixed blessing. All allergy sufferers can benefit by gaining ready access to the drug without the hassle and expense of visiting a doctor to get a prescription. But while many patients with limited or no prescription drug coverage are now paying less for the drug, others complain that they have higher out-of-pocket costs because their insurance no longer covers the purchase.
