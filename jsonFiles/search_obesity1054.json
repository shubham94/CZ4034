And indeed, a new study has shown that although hypertension may not always be caused by stress, practicing a form of meditation often used as a relaxation technique can be remarkably effective in controlling it.

Among 111 African-American men and women 55 to 85, T.M. was shown to be significantly better at lowering blood pressure than progressive muscle relaxation and instruction on healthier living habits. The findings were reported yesterday in the journal Hypertension, published by the American Heart Association.", "snippet": "''RELAX!'' is an admonition commonly heard by people with hypertension, or high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease.
