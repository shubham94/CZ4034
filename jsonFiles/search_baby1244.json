''The approach of the regulations is grotesquely oversimplified, and inadequate for sensible decision making,'' said Alan J. Weisbard, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, where the conference took place. Under the Federal rules, which took effect March 22, the Department of Health and Human Services is operating a toll-free 24-hour telephone number, which must be posted in hospital maternity wards and nurseries. Government investigators have been taking reports of infants being denied food or care in hospitals receiving Federal funds.", "headline": {"main": "PHYSICIANS CRITICIZE RULES ON NEWBORNS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 682, "_id": "4fd12d2c8eb7c8105d5f7c8a", "snippet": "NEW Federal regulations affecting the treatment of severely handicapped newborn babies came under sharp criticism yesterday at a conference of doctors, philosophers, lawyers and historians debating the ethics of caring for seriously ill infants.  ...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/07/garden/physicians-criticize-rules-on-newborns.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BIRTH DEFECTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BABIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOCTORS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOSPITALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REGULATION AND DEREGULATION OF INDUSTRY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HANDICAPPED"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Glenn", "lastname": "COLLINS"}], "original": "By GLENN COLLINS"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1983-04-07T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Home and Garden; Health; Style"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Living Desk", "lead_paragraph": "''REACH out and touch someone,'' American Telephone and Telegraph urges potential callers. The advertisement reflects on the conditions of life for millions of Americans: distant, isolated, lonely. Loneliness is now a national epidemic, according to many sociologists and psychologists, who point to such contributing causes as our highly technological society where many workers interact more with machines than with other people; to our mobility, with the average American moving 14 times during a lifetime; to the impersonality of large urban settings where many people don't even know their immediate neighbors; to the prevalence of divorce, which now ends half of American marriages. Loneliness is not the same as being alone. A person can be just as lonely in a group of people as when home alone. And those who choose solitude may never be lonely. Rather, loneliness is a state of feeling unconnected to other people, of wanting to be with someone who isn't there, of having no one to turn to who can affirm your essential human qualities.", "headline": {"main": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "word_count": 1437, "_id": "4fd136368eb7c8105d607808", "snippet": "''REACH out and touch someone,'' American Telephone and Telegraph urges potential callers.
