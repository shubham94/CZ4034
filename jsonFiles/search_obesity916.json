Doctors attribute much of the rise to obesity, which is also increasing steadily, with more than half of Americans now overweight. Most of the patients have Type 2 diabetes, commonly called adult onset diabetes, which accounts for 90 percent to 95 percent of the cases of the disease and can be brought on by inactivity and weight gain. Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for most of the remaining 5 percent to 10 percent of cases, is caused by a malfunction of the immune system and is not linked to obesity.", "snippet": "The incidence of diabetes increased markedly in the United States from 1990 to 1998, including a 76 percent rise in cases among people in their 30's, researchers are reporting today, and they warn that the disease will take a harsh toll in...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "DIET AND NUTRITION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "WEIGHT", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "STATES (US)", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "DIABETES", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "FINANCES", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "1", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 1140, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
