Anderson (PG-13, 110 minutes). Set in a Jules Verne world beneath the earth's surface in an incalculably ancient pyramid buried 2,000 feet beneath the Antarctic ice cap, Mr. Anderson's film imagines an apocalyptic conflict between two of 20th Century Fox's franchise monsters, on loan from ''Alien'' (1979) and ''Predator'' (1986). The humans don't have much to do in ''Alien vs. Predator'' but put the plot in motion and stand back to watch it work, a precarious position that eventually claims most of them. Though Mr. Anderson does have an idea for creating a rooting interest, it's too far-fetched even for fantasy, and the film turns into a cold but occasionally impressive special-effects extravaganza (Dave Kehr).", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film.
