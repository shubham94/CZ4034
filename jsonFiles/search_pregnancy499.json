The eldest son of Katherine and Murray Seiden, Mel attended schools in New Jersey and graduated from Harvard College (1952) and Harvard Law School (1955). He served in the Navy from 1955-1958 and retired as a Lieutenant. Mel was inspired by the life of Paul J. Sachs who, after a successful career at Goldman Sachs, became an associate director of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard. Mel started in the investment field at Loeb Rhoades & Co. (1958-1961), then founded Seiden & deCuevas (1962-1986). He was chairman of several venture capital funds in the 1970's. Mel was also a trustee of various Merrill Lynch mutual funds and investment companies from 1981-2002, and he was most recently a consultant and director of Edge Management. After retiring from active work in the financial field, he devoted himself to art and philanthropy. As he was colorblind, he developed a special interest in drawings, cartoons (New Yorker) and caricatures (Al Hirschfeld) and most recently illuminated medieval manuscripts, all of which he collected on behalf of institutions. His philanthropic activities were centered at Harvard, including Villa I Tatti, The School of Public Health and various art museums and libraries. He also derived enormous pleasure, and made great friends, at the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund in Boston where he was a trustee from 2004-2010. His New York philanthropies were centered at The Morgan Library, where he was on several visiting committees; The Frick Collection, where he was a trustee; and The Childrens' Aid Society, where he was also a trustee and helped develop programs to counter obesity and teenage pregnancy. He supported art by financing catalogues and exhibitions around the globe from The Shanghai Art Museum, The Ambrosiana in Milan, the Museums of Scotland, The Albertina in Vienna, British libraries and museums. Mel had an iconoclastic turn of mind, an astonishing memory and delightful wit. He was kind and thoughtful in conversation and a wonderful companion, friend and mentor. In addition to legions of friends, he leaves his wife, Janine Luke, three sisters, numerous nieces and nephews and his devoted associates, Bea Pappagallo and Chiquita Harding, all of whom colored his life and provided love and fun.
