I carefully selected a pediatric surgeon who operated at a hospital where it was possible for a parent to stay overnight with a child. When we arrived at the hospital the afternoon before surgery, I was told no beds for parents were available that day. I said I would sleep on the floor if necessary, but I was not going home without my son. Later I was glad of my persistence, not only for the sake of my son, who turned to me for reassurance each time another doctor or nurse performed some examination or procedure, but also for the many children there who were unaccompanied by a parent.
