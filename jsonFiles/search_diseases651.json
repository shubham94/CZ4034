The tribes in question were the Onge, Jarawa, Great Andamanese and Sentinelese -- all living on the Andaman Islands -- and they numbered some 400 people in all. The article, noting that several of the archipelago's islands were low-lying, in the direct path of the wave, and that casualties were expected to be high, said, ''Some beads may have just gone missing from the Emerald Necklace of India.'' The metaphor is as colorful as it is well intentioned. But what exactly does it mean? After all, in a catastrophe that cost more than 150,000 lives, why should the survival of a few hundred tribal people have any special claim on our attention? There are several possible answers to this question. The people of the Andamans have a unique way of life. True, their material culture does not extend beyond a few simple tools, and their visual art is confined to a few geometrical motifs, but they are hunter-gatherers and so a rarity in the modern world. Linguists, too, find them interesting since they collectively speak three languages seemingly unrelated to any others. But the Times of India took a slightly different tack. These tribes are special, it said, because they are of ''Negrito racial stocks'' that are ''remnants of the oldest human populations of Asia and Australia.''", "headline": {"main": "A Family Tree in Every Gene", "kicker": "Op-Ed Contributor"}, "abstract": "Armand Marie Leroi Op-Ed article examines debate about whether genetic data show that races clearly exist; says anthropologists and geneticists have for years defined race as social concept, not scientific one; holds it is genetic variants common to one group or another that defines race, that race is vital shorthand that enables people to speak sensibly about genetic rather than cultural or political differences; says discussion of race offers benefits: it would remove disjunction in which government and public embrace categories that most scholars and scientists say do not exist; it would improve medical care and treatment, as different races are prone to different illnesses; it could lead to further study of why certain races have specific characteristics; finally, it gives reason to protect most obscure and marginalized people; drawing (M)", "print_page": "21", "word_count": 2310, "_id": "4fd283a18eb7c8105d852089", "snippet": "The idea that human races are only social constructs has been the consensus for at least 30 years.
