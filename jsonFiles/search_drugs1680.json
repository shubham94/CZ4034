A good deal of attention has been captured by those who call themselves the ''right to life'' movement: activists who seek to protect the unborn by opposing abortion. But at the other end of life, where machines and drugs can prolong life often beyond the will of patients to live it, hundreds of thousands of people are organizing to secure the rights of patients who want ''death with dignity.'' Increasing AwarenessAmericans' awareness is increasing rapidly, according to proponents. ''Ten years ago,'' A. J. Levinson, executive director of Concern for Dying, said, ''I'd get up in front of some group and say 'right to die' and everyone would say, 'What?' Today, virtually everyone has heard of it.
