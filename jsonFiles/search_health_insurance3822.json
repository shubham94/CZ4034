Omarska was the most notorious camp of the Bosnian war. Reports had already emerged that the guards there did not merely kill Muslim and Croat inmates but beat and tortured them to death with singular sadism and personal brutality. Kovacevic told the reporters they could visit Omarska but said that they would find ''not concentration camps but transit centers,'' and that what they were witnessing was ''a great moment in the history of the Serbian nation.'' Three years later, on a Radio Prijedor program commemorating that great moment, he boasted, ''I'm not afraid of any of those 21 cells in The Hague.''
