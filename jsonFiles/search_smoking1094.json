Daniel Stern, a spokesman for the Air Pollution Control Association, said last week that indoor air pollution had been chosen as the group's main theme for the coming year. ''The reason is that indoor air pollution is one of the major issues of our time,'' said Mr. Stern, adding that hazardous waste and acid rain had been the only other themes chosen in past years. Dr. Joseph J. Soporowski Jr., a professor of environmental science at Rutgers, the State University, will be installed as the association's president at its annual meeting in Detroit next Sunday, when the indoor air-pollution theme will be announced. (The association comprises scientists and engineers in the private and public sector, including several hundred from New Jersey.) At last year's meeting in San Francisco, officials of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency disclosed that they had, through a New Jersey-based study, discovered a way to accurately measure individual exposure to indoor air pollution.", "snippet": "HAVING implemented a means of accurately measuring exposure to indoor air pollution, scientists and engineers will begin next week to promote a greater awareness of its health dangers.
