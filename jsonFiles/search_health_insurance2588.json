Google said it earned $733 million in the third quarter, up 92 percent from a year ago. Revenue climbed to $2.69 billion, with 44 percent of that coming from outside the United States. [Page C3.] DOW ABOVE 12,000 -- The Dow Jones industrial average closed above the psychologically important 12,000 level for the first time, indicating that investors were increasingly confident that the economy was poised to perform the rare feat of slowing without stalling. The performance in the months ahead will depend, in part, how gracefully the economy handles the slowing housing market. [C1.] BIG BANK EARNINGS -- Citigroup seemed to stumble and Bank of America appeared to strut through a messy third quarter as the country's two biggest banks contended with pressures of a slowing economy and higher interest rates. [C3] CBS SETTLES ACCUSATIONS -- CBS became the first radio corporation to settle accusations of illicit pay-for-play practices made by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general. CBS, which runs approximately 180 radio stations, agreed to adopt more stringent policies on its stations' dealings with record labels and to make a $2 million payment to New York charities. [C3.] MEDICINE VS. MARKETING -- For many doctors, it's an irresistible pitch: a $250 profit from a 15-minute test. With that lure, some 12,000 of the nation's physicians have purchased an automated device that checks patients for nerve disease. Specialists say the problem is that many general practitioners are not qualified to do such tests. [A1.] HIGHER PROFITS AT DRUG MAKERS -- Drug makers continued to post strong profit gains, led by Pfizer, the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, which reported that its third-quarter earnings had more than doubled from a year earlier. Eli Lilly, Novartis, and Wyeth also reported higher quarterly profits. [C2] VIDEO GAME WARS -- Laying the groundwork for a battle against rival Microsoft, Sony said that 21 games would be available for the PlayStation 3 game console when it goes on sale next month. Sony also plans to highlight the console's ability to play high-definition DVD's in Sony's Blu-ray format. [C11.] BANNER YEAR IN HONG KONG -- In a reflection of China's growing prominence in international finance, Hong Kong is set for a banner year in global markets with more money raised by companies selling shares to the public here than on the biggest exchanges in New York and London. Pricing will be set today for the world's largest IPO ever, that of China's biggest bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. [C1.] BEYOND REGULATORS' REACH -- Every month, roughly 19,000 households across the country write check to Christian Care Ministry. The members pool their health expenses and contributions and the ministry writes checks to health care providers. Such payments totaled $57 million in the latest fiscal year. While ministry members say they are helping to carry each others burdens, some Florida state officials see what they would call unregulated health insurance. [C1.] RULING AGAINST GRASSO -- A New York judge ruled that Richard A. Grasso, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, would have to return as much as $100 million of a fiercely contested $139.5 million retirement payout to the exchange The judge, Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said that Mr. Grasso did not disclose to his fellow directors on the board of the exchange the extent to which his soaring compensation had caused his pension and savings to balloon. [A1.] MERGER REVERBERATIONS -- The $8 billion combination of Chicago's derivatives markets is being heralded as good for Chicago and good for the exchanges. But in Europe, it is raising concerns at banks and rival exchanges that it may increase costs or stifle competition. One of the biggest fears in London where the local derivatives exchange will be dwarfed, is that it creates a so-called vertical silo, or a market where one giant entity is both a trading platform and a clearing system. [C8.] NBC STAFF CUTBACKS -- NBC said it planned to reduce its 6,000-person newsgathering staff by an estimated 5 percent, or 300 people to adapt to the migration of news viewers to the Internet and eliminate overlaps in news coverage. Steve Capus, president of NBC News, said the bulk of the cuts would come from eliminating jobs already vacant, as well as from early retirements and voluntary buyouts, but that some layoffs were inevitable. [C4.] LOWER COST PROGRAMMING -- As part of the extensive cost-cutting program it announced yesterday, NBC intends to dramatically alter its prime-time programming, starting in the fall of 2007, filling the 8 p.m. hour each night of the week with lower-cost, unscripted programs and saving its more expensive scripted comedies and dramas for the 9-to-11 block. [C1.] WEAK NEWSPAPER PROFITS -- Newspaper companies continued to show weakness, with The New York Times Company and the Tribune Company both reporting lackluster earnings, citing soft advertising sales as a major culprit. At the Times Company, the slowdown ''is expected to continue through the end of the year,'' said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. [C7.] ONLINE Business Briefing Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business. McDonald's reported a 15 percent rise in third-quarter profitmeeting a better-than-expected forecast it gave last week. (REUTERS) The UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest provider of health insurance, said third-quarter net income rose 38 percent after acquisitions raised the number of policyholders. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) Travelers packed planes operated by Continental Airlines and Southwest Airlines over the summer, but Continental's third-quarter profit grew while Southwest's earnings fell in another sign that traditional carriers were narrowing the gap with low-cost rivals.
