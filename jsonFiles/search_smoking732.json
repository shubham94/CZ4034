The authors of the reports, in The Journal of the American Medical Association, suggested that current safety standards for lead exposure in both adults and children, which have considerably reduced the incidence of lead poisoning in this country, may need to be tightened even further. The men studied, who ranged from middle-aged to elderly, had the same exposure to lead most Americans had in the last 40 or 50 years, said Dr. Howard Hu, a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health and a co-author of both studies. They were chosen because they were participants in a long-term study on aging conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs, giving researchers considerable data about their health. \"Few of them had occupational or untoward exposures,\" Dr. Hu said. Rather, they had picked up lead from sources in the environment, including lead-soldered food cans and water pipes and fumes from leaded gasoline.", "snippet": "LEAD may be even more dangerous than previously thought, causing high blood pressure and kidney impairment at unexpectedly low levels, according to two studies of adult men published today.
