It cuts to a montage of children, families, blue-collar workers, boarded-up homes and more scenes of Mr. Clinton's speech. It closes with a little girl, hand on chest, pledging allegiance to the flag. SCRIPT Mr. Clinton, delivering his State of the Union Message: \"Our first challenge is to cherish our children and strengthen America's families. They must be able to buy health insurance policies that they do not lose when they change jobs and to make up to $10,000 a year of college tuition tax deductible, and preserve Medicare and Medicaid.
