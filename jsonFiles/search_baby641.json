The procedure will put her at risk for infections, hemorrhages and death. But Kelly will receive no physical benefits. Her body is simply the gatekeeper for the main event: an operation on a 24-week-old, one-pound fetus nestled inside her. To reach the fetus, Dr. Joseph Bruner slices a wide arc across Kelly's abdomen. Once the incision is complete, he pushes down on her stomach with his right hand while reaching inside with his left. Carefully, he nudges the uterus loose from its home. Then, with both hands, he gently lifts it out of Kelly's body, as if it were a fragile glass bowl, and rests it on top of her.", "headline": {"main": "A Miracle, and Yet"}, "abstract": "Maggie Jones article on medical and ethical issues in fetal surgery, which is increasingly being attempted not simply to save lives but also to treat nonfatal illnesses; pioneering work of Drs Joseph Bruner and Noel Tulipan at Vanderbilt University Medical Center described; photos; pre-birth surgery also becomes enmeshed in abortion debate, as anti-abortion activists brandish photos taken during fetal surgery to bolster their position (M)", "print_page": "39", "word_count": 4773, "_id": "4fd227658eb7c8105d7b0438", "snippet": "It is midafternoon on a Wednesday in early January, and Operating Room No. 5 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center is a backdrop of blue: blue scrubs on the 10 nurses and doctors who crowd around the O.R. table; blue sterile sheets on 28-year-old...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/magazine/a-miracle-and-yet.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BRUNER, JOSEPH"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "TULIPAN, NOEL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ABORTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SURGERY AND SURGEONS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Maggie", "lastname": "Jones"}], "original": "By Maggie Jones"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2001-07-15T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 2, "offset": 0, "time": 44}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
