This poses an ethical problem, exposing the immense gulf between expanding scientific knowledge and the wisdom needed to deal with the epidemic humanely. The policy may also have dangerous consequences, affecting our ability to control AIDS in the future. The doctors choosing who will or will not get the latest medication appear to be making their decisions based on scientific fact. Because H.I.V. multiplies and mutates rapidly, they reason, the virus will become drug-resistant in people who take their medicine sporadically.
