In 1990, Congress asked the executive branch to report by 1992 whether there should be a defined ratio of staff to patients in nursing homes, but it was not until 1997 that the study got priority, and not until 11 days ago -- in a labor market grown so tight that 41 states have reported that nursing homes cannot hire or retain the staff they need -- that the Health Care Financing Administration finally delivered draft copies to Congress.", "headline": {"main": "Acceptable Nursing Home Care"}, "abstract": "Editorial urges Congress to restore some of Medicare money cut from nursing homes three years ago and to tie such funds to defined ratios of staff to patients that are needed to provide good care (S)", "print_page": "18", "word_count": 428, "_id": "4fd240c88eb7c8105d7d8a8d", "snippet": "For decades, hundreds of thousands of frail older Americans have suffered unnecessary neglect, injury, abuse, malnutrition and even death while in the paid care of licensed nursing homes.
