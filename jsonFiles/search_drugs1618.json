The new study, conducted on people with advanced cases of cancer, concluded that their ways of life, social backgrounds and personalities had no bearing on whether they got better or died.

After an extensive series of mouse studies, researchers at the University of Alabama Medical School at Birmingham and the World Health Organization collaborating center in Mainz, West Germany, are reporting results that challenge past scientific dogma about what it is that causes the body to destroy the shock-absorbing cartilage in its joints - the anatomical areas where two or more bones meet - and that can bring on permanent pain, swelling and severe lameness. There is some debate over the new findings, and it may take years before they are fully verified.
