The Erez checkpoint, as it is called, has been for 27 years the main gate of one of humanity's larger holding pens, and its form has followed its function to a brutal conclusion. It is a clutter of small, shabby buildings set in a landscape of dirt, old asphalt, razor wire and, especially, concrete. Concrete is the checkpoint's grossmotif, in the form of the rough cubes that are, literally, its building blocks. The massive squares are staggered in a slalom course in the strip of road that leads to the stopping point, and are stacked atop each other to form the crude watchtowers and machine gun nests from which the soldiers of the Israeli Defense Force stare down: hard, brown young men, opaquely impassive behind their sunglasses, M-16's at the casual ready. The blocks are painted in bright regimental colors, but concrete grimed by diesel exhaust and gouged by would-be border runners and bullets is hard to prettify. Gaza's checkpoints (Erez is only the first among many) are a physical manifestation of the reality of the Palestinian experience, which is nowhere expressed in a more pure or concentrated form. The Gaza Strip is a small, misshapen rectangle of generally barren land tucked into the corner formed by the meeting of Egypt, Israel and the Mediterranean Sea. For most of its history, it has been sparsely populated, and its people always have been poor and powerless. They have lived under the control of armed outsiders for hundreds of years: first the Turks of the Ottoman Empire, then the British, the Egyptians, the Israelis. On Sept. 13, 1993, on the White House lawn, Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Yasir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization signed an agreement that made this place the heart of something called the Palestinian Autonomous Region -- an odd, ambivalent entity that is no longer a ward of the Jewish state but not a state of its own either. The pact also made Arafat the head of the Palestinian National Authority, a government that doesn't entirely exist or entirely not exist, but, in Cheshire cat fashion, fades in and out of reality depending on the angle and the time at which it is viewed.", "headline": {"main": "IN GAZA, PEACE MEETS PATHOLOGY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "56", "word_count": 11578, "_id": "4fd1f6e18eb7c8105d751a51", "snippet": "THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE GAZA STRIP IS an ugly thing, raw as a sore, bleak as an illness.
