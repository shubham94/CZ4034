No matter how hard Carson Hughes tries, he can't bring himself to eat the six franks in front of him. So they sit there on the table, each on its own plate, abandoned like orphaned children. Hughes breaks one in half and lifts it to his mouth, steeling himself for one last attempt, but he can't manage even a bite. Slowly, he lowers both the dog and his head in defeat. It is 11:30 p.m., the end of a long night of gastronomic training for Hughes. For the past four hours, he and his wife, Tereasa, have been buffet-hopping with me in and around their hometown of Newport News, Va. First came Captain George's Seafood, where the 44-year-old Hughes systematically attacked the 80-foot spread, downing 10 soft-shell crabs, 120 or so shrimp, a small steak, a handful of crawfish, a plate of crab legs and one (purely symbolic) asparagus stalk. At one point, he peeled and ate 60 shrimp while Tereasa timed him with her electronic wristwatch. Tossing them into his churning maw as if they were M&M's, shellfish shrapnel spraying the table, he finished in 4 minutes 32 seconds, an effort he pronounced ''respectable.''", "snippet": "It ends with the hot dogs.
