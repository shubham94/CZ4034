Suddenly, a van pulled up, the rear doors opened and two skinny youths in T-shirts pushed an upright piano onto the pavement. The pianist produced a stool, plopped himself down and began to play a riff, while his companion assembled a clarinet. Soon, the squiggles and syncopations of jazz and honky-tonk entertained a delighted audience who rewarded them with a large pile of francs. We have a phrase -- ''the mind's eye'' -- for remembered sights, but no such expression exists for sound. Whenever Michael and I travel, we dutifully preserve the views in photographs, which we eventually plaster into albums. But it's the musical experiences, both planned and serendipitous, that often evoke the most pleasurable memories: the nostalgic notes of the odd oboes and brass playing the sardana in front of Barcelona's cathedral; the mellow tones of the artful flutist in a Roman metro passageway; the robust oompahs of a band in the Strasbourg town square; the icy tremolos of Vivaldi's ''Winter'' played by a chamber orchestra in the church of St.-Julien-le-Pauvre in Paris.", "headline": {"main": "The Melody Lingers On"}, "abstract": "Barbara Comins article on memories of music heard while traveling; drawing (M)", "print_page": "31", "word_count": 1086, "_id": "4fd20db38eb7c8105d77e282", "snippet": "IN Paris one summer, my husband, Michael, and I were sitting on the sunny steps of the plaza outside the Musee d'Orsay, having just spent hours glutting ourselves on the Impressionist paintings.

There was a time not too long ago, the 39-year-old Lippin said cheerfully, when the mere thought of crossing that bridge in an automobile filled her with extreme dread, a physiological immersion in fear most of us can only imagine. ''Somehow I figured out how to get the phone number of the 24-hour control booth for the bridge,'' she said, still dismayed by the depth of her anxiety and embarrassed about the ingenuity it inspired. Lippin -- a mother of two, a lawyer and now a Manhattan therapist who treats people with phobias -- recalled the lengths to which she used to go to avoid getting stuck in traffic on the bridge.
