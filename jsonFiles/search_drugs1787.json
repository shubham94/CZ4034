Several promising new weapons, such as immunotherapy and hyperthermia (heat treatment), now under study are expected to extend this progress to more patients in the near future. Surgery Surgery remains the most common method of treating cancers that form solid tumors, such as cancer of the colon, rectum and breast. Surgery alone can cure cancer that is confined to one spot. Even if the cancer cannot be cut out completely, surgery can reduce its size,which may enhance the effectiveness of other therapies and relieve the patient's discomfort. Sometimes surgery is used as a cancer preventive, for example, when precancerous polyps are removed from the colon or the larynx. However, cancer surgery can have disfiguring or crippling effects when the tumor is in or near a readily visible part of the body, such as the breast, neck or leg, or when surgery means loss of an important body function, such as speech following removal of the larynx. Thus, in recent years cancer researchers have increasingly turned away from the knife to other treatments, such as radiation, that may be as effective as surgery but less damaging to the patient.", "headline": {"main": "TRADITIONAL TREATMENTS JOINED BY PROMISING WEAPONS therapy"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 1618, "_id": "4fd1231c8eb7c8105d5e6cfa", "snippet": "RECENT gains in a patient's chances of surviving cancer reflect improvements in the traditional methods of cancer treatment - surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy - and new tactics in applying them to increase the probability of cure.

It has stimulated upward mobility and achieved a better life for millions of Americans. It has been the voice of working men and women, winning for them the right to decent wages and working conditions. It has protected racial and religious minorities from injustice and discrimination. It has promoted quality education for all of America's young and has secured, for older citizens, a living income and adequate medical care. Democratic programs have been the catalyst for vibrant economic growth in the private sector of the economy. The Democratic Party has seen our American government not as an enemy, not as ''the problem,'' as President Reagan said it was in his Inaugural Address, but as a necessary instrument for achieving vital public goals. Government provides for the common defense, for the education of the young, for the exploration of space and assured production of food. No Administration, no matter what its ideology or commitments, can dispense with these and other critical functions of government if it expects to serve the American people.", "headline": {"main": "TEXT OF STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC MATTERS ADOPTED BY HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": 2180, "_id": "4fd118838eb7c8105d5d0912", "snippet": "Following is the text of the statement of Democratic Economic Principles adopted today by the House Democratic Caucus:   For half a century, the Democratic Party has been an engine of equity and progress in America.

More than 500,000 cases of child abuse are reported every year and it is estimated that 1.5 million other cases go unreported. Since abused children are inclined to become abusive adults, the syndrome of child abuse and neglect is passed from one generation to the next unless it is overcome by treatment or prevention. With these grim statistics in the background, the fifth National Conference on Child Abuse and Neglect convened here Sunday so that child-care professionals could share information and respond to the Reagan Administration's proposed $1.2 billion cut in social-service programs for children. A funereal mood prevailed yesterday, the first full session of the conference, which is jointly sponsored by the Region 5 Child Abuse and Neglect Resource Center, based here, and the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, part of the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. The day was dominated by speeches predicting the consequences of the 25 percent budget cut and rallying participants to lobby against it.", "headline": {"main": "CHILD-ABUSE PARLEY DEPLORES FUND CUTS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1244, "_id": "4fd11a7a8eb7c8105d5d52c4", "snippet": "One of every four American girls is sexually abused before the age of 18.
