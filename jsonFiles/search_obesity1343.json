''Nutrition is getting more attention in the medical school curriculum today,'' said Dr. August G. Swanson, director of academic affairs of the Association of American Medical Colleges. ''About 100 of the 143 medical schools in the United States and Canada now offer some sort of course.'' Most of the courses are elective. About 15 medical schools have required courses. According to Dr. Sohrab Mobarhan, a gastroenterologist at the University of Illinois, ''Medical schools tended to overlook nutrition until recently because it was assumed that if a person lived in a wealthy country and had enough money to buy food, he would not have a nutritional problem. Now that attitude is beginning to change because research has shown that 40 percent of all patients who are hospitalized are malnourished.''", "snippet": "CONCERNED about patients' complaints that some physicians know little about nutrition, an increasing number of medical schools are offering instruction that ranges from how to tell whether an alcoholic is malnourished to the role of intravenous...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "DIET AND NUTRITION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "MEDICAL SCHOOLS", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "1", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 1369, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
