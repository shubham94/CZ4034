In cities and towns throughout the country, flu-afflicted hosts and hostesses were forced to cancel parties, others directed preparations from bed, and still others postponed planned gatherings because so many of their guests were laid low by this fast-spreading virus. Moreover, the disease has far from run its course. Though epidemics in the New England states have peaked and the New York City epidemic is nearing a culmination, flu is just now gaining a foothold in many regions and has hardly begun in others. Communitywide outbreaks generally last for four to six weeks, and nationally, the height of the flu season runs from late November through March. Although the virus spreads fastest during cold weather when people spend lots of time indoors in close contact with one another, persons living in warm climates are by no means exempt from influenza outbreaks. In fact, California has been one of the hardest-hit states this season.", "headline": {"main": "COUNTERING THE SPREAD OF THE FLU VIRUS", "kicker": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "word_count": 1313, "_id": "4fd10cdd8eb7c8105d5c0cab", "snippet": "AS an illness that predominates during the winter months, it's not unusual for flu to spoil the Christmas holidays for millions of Americans, and this year was no exception.

You and I, Democrats and Republicans, upstaters and downstaters, set aside our differences, and working together as New Yorkers, reversed a long slide toward insolvency. Now we are faced with the sometimes tedious, often frustrating job of guaranteeing that the gains we have won are the foundation of a new era - not a lost opportunity. This is not the first such instance in our history. Two-hundred years ago, in 1781, six years after the struggle for independence had begun, a British Army band, trying to find the music to match the moment, stood at Yorktown and played a tune called ''The World Turned Upside Down.'' The music fit. Americans had shaken an empire and overturned the old beliefs of inherited inequality and the old structures of political and economic injustice.", "headline": {"main": "TRANSCRIPT OF GOV.
