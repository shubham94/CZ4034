As the holidays approach, escapism is running rampant. Moviegoers can find Terence Stamp rocketing to Mars, Christine Baranski hanging out in Whoville and Jeremy Irons battling evil in a fantasy empire. Actual distant lands are popular, too, with an unusual number of films from Asia. And most of the children's films are set on other continents. Even close to home, the world seems to be awash in vampires, werewolves, seemingly normal humans with supernatural powers and young people close to the Devil. At least most of the documentaries are serious. And in the midst of it all, there are love stories, war dramas and portraits of artists as violently talented men. Opening dates, as always, are subject to change. November ''SUZHOU RIVER'' From mainland China, a modernist film noir about a videomaker's attraction to two women (played ''Vertigo'' style by the same actress).
