Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he would decide next week whether to uphold or strike down the rules, which took effect March 22. The judge, who is the son of a famous child psychologist and pediatrician, Dr. Arnold L. Gesell, said the new rules would have a ''profound effect'' on the practice of medicine and would ''reach into a hospital's apportionment of its life-sustaining resources.'' The rules require hospitals to post notices saying, ''Discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infants in this facility is prohibited by Federal law.'' Anyone who knows about a handicapped infant's being denied ''customary medical care'' is asked to call the Federal Government on a toll-free telephone number.", "headline": {"main": "RULES TO AID HANDICAPPED INFANTS FACE COURT TEST"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 677, "_id": "4fd12d2c8eb7c8105d5f7cd8", "snippet": "A Federal district judge heard an impassioned argument here today on the legality of Federal rules that require doctors and hospitals to provide food and medical care to infants with severe birth defects.
