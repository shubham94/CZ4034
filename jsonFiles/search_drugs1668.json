Potent anti-inflammatory medications notwithstanding, exercise is now recognized as one of the most effective treatments - and preventives - of crippling arthritis. The benefits of properly designed exercises combined with periods of complete rest were dramatically demonstrated by a couple who were afflicted with arthritis in their late 50's. When the wife realized that she was quickly losing her ability to climb stairs (a serious problem in a three-story house) and walk to the corner grocery store, she sought the help of a physical therapist who prescribed a balanced program of exercise and rest. Ten years later, she is able to walk a mile without tiring, carries her own groceries home and negotiates the long flights of stairs with relative ease. Her husband interpreted the diagnosis as a portent of immobility. He retired from his job as a builder and sat down in his favorite easy chair to await disability. And that is exactly what happened. Through the years, he has become increasingly incapacitated and is now confined to the house in a wheelchair.", "headline": {"main": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "word_count": 1418, "_id": "4fd1536f8eb7c8105d635fff", "snippet": "IN response to the pain, many of the 40 million Americans who suffer from arthritis stop trying to move arthritic joints, aggravating the problem and causing permanent crippling.
