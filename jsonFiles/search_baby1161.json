Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink.'' In ancient Carthage, the law forbade bridal couples to drink on their wedding night. And in 1834, a report to the British House of Commons noted that infants born to alcoholic mothers had ''a starved, shriveled and imperfect look.'' But it was not until 1973 that medical scientists confirmed what people seem to have known for thousands of years: that alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman can damage her unborn child. That year two pediatric researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle rediscovered and named fetal alcohol syndrome. At first it was thought that only the offspring of heavy-drinking alcoholic mothers were at risk. Now it is known that even as little as two drinks a week may do damage, and knowledgeable physicians recommend that women abstain completely from alcohol from the moment they start trying to conceive until they are finished nursing. Even women who drank during previous pregnancies with no apparent ill effect on their offspring are cautioned against assuming that subsequent children will be similarly spared.", "headline": {"main": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": 1180, "_id": "4fd156038eb7c8105d63a4d8", "snippet": "IN the Old Testament, Samson's mother is admonished by an angel: ''Thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
