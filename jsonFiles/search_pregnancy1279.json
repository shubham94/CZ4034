No matter where one looked, there were things to do. Musicians played; singers sang; arms waved; feet flashed. Mr. Adams has given us an oratorio as splintered and variegated as the California both he and Mr. Sellars live in, and here the latter has made sure that the eyes will have no rest. The basic conceit is a healthy one: that the birth of Jesus must be re-enacted by each succeeding age. ''El Nino'' dispenses with camels in the desert, tipsy British carolers in the snow and the images from Currier & Ives. Its Joseph and Mary are Hispanic teenagers seeking shelter on the freeways, public beaches and parking lots of Southern California. (The Madonna of Mr. Sellars's film is astonishingly beautiful.)
