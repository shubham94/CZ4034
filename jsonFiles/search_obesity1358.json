They knew, though, that none of them would ever write it because, to captivate the victims of dietmania, it would have to make promises that ranged from medically questionable to scientifically impossible. Ingredients were: * The promise of a dramatic, quick weight loss, preferably 10 pounds in the first week or two, while eating all you want and never feeling hungry. * A highly specific menu so that the dieter wouldn't have to face choices. * Precalculated caloric values so that the dieter wouldn't have to add or subtract (or weigh and measure).", "snippet": "AT a medical meeting some years ago, a group of science writers concocted a recipe for a sure-fire, best-selling diet book.

Instead of emerging from its burrow for a brief look-see, as it is apt to do on Feb. 2 or any other randomly chosen day in midwinter, the woodchuck - along with bats, ground squirrels, hedgehogs, dormice and several other rodents and insectivores of cold and temperate zones -has come to the end of his winter hibernation and rejoins the world of the full-time mammals. Unlike, for example, bears, which merely doze and can awaken suddenly on provocation, true hibernators shut down shop for the duration. The metabolism of these animals drops to nearly nothing. Body temperature falls nearly to freezing. Heartbeat slows - in ground squirrels, for example, from 350 beats per minute to three or four. Stuffed with fat stored in the summer, they doze through months of snow and ice, which might otherwise starve them to death by depriving them of forage. In spring they emerge, thinner than before but ready to start a new season.", "snippet": "SOME time this month, the woodchuck wakes for good.
