Ms. Hiatt's death came nearly seven months after she had given an unintended overdose to an infant heart patient, a medical error that was said to have contributed to the child's death days later. Ms. Hiatt had been a nurse for 27 years and had often cared for the 8-month-old girl during the child's stay in the pediatric intensive care unit of her hospital. She had probably drawn up the right dose of the drug hundreds of times in her career. But once, she made a life-changing error. A baby died, and she was suspended, then fired from a profession she loved. And now she's dead. This story makes me feel sick -- sick for that dead baby and her parents, and sick for Kim, who must have felt so alone with her pain.", "headline": {"main": "Big or Small, Nurses' Mistakes Reverberate", "kicker": "ESSAY"}, "abstract": "Theresa Brown essay on experience of making medical errors as a nurse, and what it can be like to have to live with the knowledge and consequences of a failure in patient care; drawing (M)", "print_page": "6", "word_count": 1103, "_id": "4fd2ac188eb7c8105d898fc7", "snippet": "This year, a Seattle nurse named Kim Hiatt committed suicide.
