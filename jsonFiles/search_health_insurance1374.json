Pioneer aerialists like Christian Fletcher employed the new moves but paid a high personal price. They were barred from competition and lost sponsorships. Mr. Olsen said he recognized that viewers have become accustomed to a high level of sophistication in surfing videos, adding that he was thankful to have found sources like Jon Steele and Elliot Leboe, \"two fantastic filmmakers\" who provided extra footage. The result is a dazzling exploration of surfing's past, present and probably airborne future.
