George Pataki announced yesterday that he would not run in 2006 for a fourth term. This is a wise course. Not only have the governor's recent polls looked a little pallid, but Mr. Pataki also knows from firsthand experience that New York State's voters begin to tire of their leaders after a while. In 1994, that fed-up factor -- with Gov. Mario Cuomo -- helped Mr. Pataki get elected in the first place. It is too soon to give a full assessment of Mr. Pataki's performance. He has done well with the environment, but the rate of reform in Albany remains too slow. He still has time over the next year and a half, presuming he's not too busy in Iowa or New Hampshire, to fill gaps in his legacy as leader of New York State for a dozen crucial years.", "headline": {"main": "The Governor's Exit Strategy", "kicker": "Editorial"}, "abstract": "Editorial says Gov George Pataki is wise not to seek fourth term, considering New York State voters' habit of tiring of their leaders; cites issues Pataki should work on in 17 months left in his current term", "print_page": "24", "word_count": 483, "_id": "4fd24d638eb7c8105d7edb66", "snippet": "Gov.

They fear that two Supreme Court appointments by President Bush could transform America for decades to come. And they fear that President Bush will accomplish this transformation by replacing Sandra Day O'Connor and, eventually, William Rehnquist with hard-core conservatives in the mode of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. A hypothetical worst case for liberals might be a multicultural twofer: the appointment of Judge Janice Rogers Brown, an African-American libertarian who makes Thomas look mild, and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who may well surprise his right-wing critics by becoming a reliable conservative on the bench. But even if the court is, in fact, transformed, the consequences might be far less severe than liberals imagine. To begin with, most of America's legal business does not involve the court at all. The justices decide very few cases -- an average of only 82 a year during the past 10 years -- and most of them are not politically divisive. Between 1994 and 2003, 36 percent of the court's opinions were unanimous, as opposed to only 21 percent that were decided by a 5-4 vote. What's more, if the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade or its school-prayer decisions tomorrow, abortion wouldn't become illegal across America, and prayer wouldn't become mandatory. Instead, the states and Congress would have the power to regulate abortion or to allow prayer if they chose to do so. That means that the most controversial questions in American life would ultimately be settled in the court of public opinion, regardless of what the Supreme Court says.", "headline": {"main": "Supreme Modesty", "kicker": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 7-24-05"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "13", "word_count": 971, "_id": "4fd2a8b78eb7c8105d89378e", "snippet": "The highest court isn't as powerful as its critics and champions suppose.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/24/magazine/24WWLN.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "imagepages/2005/07/24/magazine/24wwln.chart.html", "rank": "2", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupHeight2": "325", "MultimediaUrl2": "imagepages/2005/07/24/magazine/24wwln.chart.html", "MultimediaPopupWidth2": "250", "MultimediaType2": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "imagepages/2005/07/20/national/24scotus.1.html", "rank": "1", "height": 325, "width": 250, "legacy": {"MultimediaPopupWidth1": "250", "MultimediaUrl1": "imagepages/2005/07/20/national/24scotus.1.html", "MultimediaPopupHeight1": "325", "MultimediaType1": "Image"}, "type": "Image"}, {"url": "images/2005/07/20/national/24scotus.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2005/07/20/national/24scotus.75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"subtype": "tiny_thumb", "legacy": {"tinythumbwidth": 55, "tinythumbheight": 55, "hastinythumb": "Y"}, "type": "image", "width": 55, "height": 55}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "O'CONNOR, SANDRA DAY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "SUPREME COURT"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Jeffrey", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Rosen"}], "original": "By Jeffrey Rosen"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-07-24T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Judge John G.
