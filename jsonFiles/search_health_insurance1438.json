Milt was born in Charleston, South Carolina on February 17, 1922. He was the beloved husband of the late Rose Prystowsky, MD. and is survived by his loving children, Doctors Stephen, Eric, Michael, Barry, and Richard, devoted daughters-in-law, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and brother, Sidney, MD. After training in pediatrics and pediatric cardiology at the Harriet Lane Home of Johns Hopkins University under the tutelage of Helen Taussig, Milt was the first pediatric cardiologist in New Jersey and opened the Division of Pediatric Cardiology at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. In his signature bow tie, he practiced as a pediatrician and pediatric cardiologist in Nutley, NJ from 1951 to 2004. Even in retirement, he continued to see patients as a consultant at Children's Hospital of New Jersey. His many years of service as a tireless healer of and advocate for children--especially those who are most vulnerable--as well as his longtime service on public health committees in New Jersey, led to improved health care and insurance benefits for children. In his more than 60 years of medical service, he had numerous accomplishments and received many awards. He was on the Founding Board of Children's Hospital (in Newark, NJ), for example. He served as President of the Public Health Council of New Jersey, which oversees the New Jersey State Department of Health. United Hospital of New Jersey recognized him with a special title, given only to him: \"Role Model for Pediatric Residents.\" The New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry presented him with a Lifetime Dean's Award. He was also Clinical Professor of Pediatrics and Pediatric Cardiology at the medical schools. And, to take but one more example, he was with the national organization of all NACRI organizations (with Children's Hospital), representing New Jersey in Washington, DC, to lobby for much needed funds. Milt's seemingly indefatigable advocacy for children is perhaps best exemplified by his having led the years-long effort to establish New Jersey's Catastrophic Children's Illness Fund--a unique model in the nation, which ensures that no family in New Jersey ever has to go bankrupt because they have a child in desperate need of catastrophic medical care. This accomplishment underscores that, first and foremost, Milt was a model humanitarian, who cared about helping persons regardless of their ability to pay, and regardless of their social station in life. Indeed, what those who knew him say that they remember most about Milt was his genuine kindness, his warmth, his caring personality. No problem was ever too small to be brought to his attention, as the many persons whose lives he touched knew it. Dr. Milton Prystowsky influenced the lives of thousands of countless lives and made a significant impact on the quality of families and communities. He will be sorely missed. Funeral services will be held Wednesday, May 12, 10am at Congregation Kneses Tifereth Israel, 575 King St., Port Chester, NY. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in Dr. Prystowsky's honor should be made to the Drs.
