In poor neighborhoods and in relatively affluent ones, adults and children are lining up in growing numbers for bags of groceries or for hot meals ladled out at soup kitchens, according to officials for the groups. They said the growing demand is taxing their resources to the point where they sometimes run out of food. No one compiles statistics citywide, but officials interviewed at 40 agencies that dish out hot meals or provide packaged food in New York City said they had found a rise since last year in the demand for food assistance. Even a year ago, more people were seeking food from many of the agencies than they had in the past. Since then, the agencies reported, there have been increases ranging from a few more a day to thousands more a month.", "snippet": "Voluntary agencies and community groups all over New York City report marked increases in people who say they have no money for food.

The average American woman faces a 1-in-11 chance of developing breast cancer sometime during her lifetime. This risk is barely lower than the 1-in-10 chance a cigarette smoker has of getting lung cancer, although the survival rate for breast cancer is substantially higher -56 percent to 85 percent after five years. Women who detect a breast tumor in its early stages have the better chance of living longer. Breast cancer is not a wholly capricious disease. Over the years, researchers have identified a number of factors that influence a woman's chances of developing this malignancy. Increased risk has been associated with a family history of breast cancer, a personal history of benign breast disease, childlessness, obesity, high socioeconomic status, early menarche and late menopause. A reduced risk has been noted among women who have their first child before age 18 and those whose ovaries are surgically removed before age 35.", "snippet": "On a typical day, more than 300 American women will be found to have breast cancer and 100 others will die of the disease.

''Gastroplasty,'' a surgical technique pioneered by doctors at the University of Iowa in 1971, attacks the problem of morbid obesity by sealing off, or stapling, all but about two ounces of the stomach into a small pouch, with a small channel leading to the rest of the stomach. Although the university discarded such surgery as imperfect in the mid-1970's, it was revived by Dr. Cesar Gomez of St. Louis University later in the decade. Gradual improvements determined the appropriate size of the small pouch and the channel, which had caused problems, and after studying Dr. Gomez's technique, Dr. Capella began performing the operations about two years ago.", "snippet": "IN THE quiet hills of Rockland County, N.Y., Dr. Rafael Capella is performing a relatively new operation that has attracted as much controversy within the medical profession as it has patients eager to try the procedure.
