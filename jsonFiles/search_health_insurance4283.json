Executives at the two companies, foreseeing significant cost savings, said they would start a six- to eight-week feasibility study to estimate the savings and decide whether to proceed with a merger. [ Page 37. ] Plea Lifts Caremark Stock The stock of Caremark rose $1.875, or 9 percent, to $21.875, after the company said Thursday night that it had agreed to plead guilty in the kickback inquiry involving its home health care business. The company said it would pay $161 million to Federal and state governments. That would force Caremark to take an after-tax charge of $110 million for the second quarter. [ 35. ] And Next, Dial Chaos? The first tangible effect of the Senate's overhaul of telecommunications law, experts say, will be chaos: new marketing deals, outrageous prices, bankruptcies, hostile takeovers and schemes to make a quick killing. But in the end, the results could be lower prices and a rush to offer advanced communication services over fiber optic networks and by satellite. [ 1. ] Clinton Budget Falls Short A study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found President Clinton's new budget plan would fall short of his goal of balancing the budget in 10 years, saying the deficit would be at $209 billion in 2005, slightly higher than it is this year. [ 8. ] European Greens Boycott Shell European environmentalists, particularly in Germany, are boycotting Royal Dutch Shell, even attacking its gasoline stations, because of plans by the company and Exxon to sink an obsolete oil rig in the North Sea. [ 3. ] Analysts Do About-Face Gordon Hall and James Clark, top-ranked analysts who left CS First Boston for Morgan Stanley on Tuesday, have returned to CS First Boston. [ 35. ] Argentina's Revenues Drop A decline in tax revenues will make it difficult for Argentina to meet budgetary targets set by the International Monetary Fund as part of a financial rescue package the country received earlier this year. Tax revenues for the first six months of the year are expected to fall 6.5 percent, or $1.5 billion, below projections. [ 34. ] Greenspan to Explain Strategy Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has scheduled an address before the Economic Club of New York for Tuesday that will be his first big attempt to explain his thinking on the economy and to counter the critics who have said the Fed was wrong to raise short-term interest rates seven times in a year. [ 46. ] Implant Settlement Shortfall Seen A $4.25 billion settlement involving breast implants is so severely underfunded that women could receive as little as 5 percent of what they were promised, a Federal court analysis has found. A partial analysis of claims filed with administrators of the settlement found that more than 70,000 women probably would be eligible to get money in the first wave of payments, far more than anyone had anticipated. [ 7. ] Olympics to Salt Lake City Salt Lake City joined Atlanta as an Olympic city, winning host rights for the 2002 Winter Olympics with a surprisingly overwhelming first-ballot victory over its rivals: Ostersund, Sweden; Sion, Switzerland, and Quebec. Salt Lake City projected an operating budget of $798 million and said sponsorships, television rights and the sale of licensed products would help meet it. [ 27. ] Hotel Chief Builds an Empire Harry R. Silverman is the biggest hotel magnate in the nation, but few people know his name. Maybe that's because he does not own his hotels. But Mr. Silverman, the chief of Hospitality Franchise Systems, has assembled an empire that controls about 4,200 mostly low- to mid-price hotels.
