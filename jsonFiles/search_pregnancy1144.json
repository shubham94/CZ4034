The gaps between visits gave Lolli time to save and shop for the brand-new outfits on layaway. In the inner city, being ''dressed'' has always been important: it means you are provided for, a part of bigger things. Sloppiness and stains were physical evidence of failure, of poverty winning its battle against you. The night before visits, Lolli would spend hours doing Nina's hair in her father's favorite style -- Shirley Temple curls. Nina groaned and grimaced. Lolli tugged and yanked. Nina winced whenever Lolli cleaned her ears (Toney sometimes checked). In prison, as on the street, a well-dressed family enhanced Toney's stature. Interactions were public, and appearances mattered. On a cold morning early last month, Nina, who is now 12, stood on her stoop, dressed, waiting to visit her father. She was glad about going to see him, eager to go anywhere, to get away from her boring block in an upstate New York town and the chaos of her house. She has been an upstate girl for more than seven years, but like her mom, she still rocks a city style. Nina's thick, dyed blond hair was pulled back in a ponytail, and she flashed a new pair of silver-and-pink Nikes. She was wearing a dark blue velvet sweatsuit Lolli bought for the day.
