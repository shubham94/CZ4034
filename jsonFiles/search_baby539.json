The measure calls for the state to borrow some $3 billion in the next decade or so to finance stem cell research in the state's medical schools and other nonprofit research institutions, with priority given to the kind of research that is now barred from receiving federal support under President Bush's policy. The amount of money is staggering, an order of magnitude as great as what is now spent by the federal government on the limited embryonic stem cell research the president is willing to support. In effect, the proposal would have California pick up the leadership role that President Bush has abdicated. Californians will decide if this is the way they wish to spend their public money.
