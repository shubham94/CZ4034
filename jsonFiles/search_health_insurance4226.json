Life insurers have been rapidly consolidating, pressed by high costs and tough competition for consumers' savings from banks and mutual funds. Aegon also said it would assume Providian debt worth $780 million and preferred stock worth $100 million. And Providian's banking subsidiary will be spun off. $(Page D2.$) Tandy to Close Electronics Chain Tandy said that it would close its Incredible Universe stores, which sell everything from computers to refrigerators to cassette tapes but have been losing money. The company will also close 19 of its Computer City stores and take a charge of $170 against earnings. $(D3.$) NCR's Price: Too High, Even Now? In one of the most disastrous corporate takeovers of recent years, AT&T acquired NCR for $7.48 billion in 1991. Today it is spinning off the computer maker for less than half that, based on the price of NCR's shares in ''when-issued'' trading. Still, some analysts think even that is too high a price. Market Place. $(D6.$) Dow Falls 11.54 on Profit-Taking A wave of late profit-taking snapped the market's eight-day advance. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.54 points, to 6,549.37, trimming its gain for the year to 28 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 3.63 points, closing at 1,287.75. The losers included some big technology stocks. $(D7.$) Treasury prices were little changed in thin trading in the last full session of the year. The 30-year bond yield edged up to 6.54 percent from 6.53 percent on Friday. $(D13.$) Humana to Cut Hundreds of Jobs Humana, the operator of managed health care plans, said it would cut 700 to 900 jobs, or as much as 5 percent of its work force, next year as it reduces costs to stem a decline in earnings. $(D3.$) Banc One to Grow in Oklahoma Banc One said that it had agreed to buy the Liberty Bancorporation of Oklahoma City for $546 million in stock. Banc One operates in 12 states, and this acquisition would give it 29 branches and $2.9 billion in assets in Oklahoma, making it one of the top three banks in the state. $(D3.$) Merger Could Squeeze Con Edison The proposed merger of Brooklyn Union and Long Island Lighting would put new pressure on the New York area's largest electricity supplier, Con Edison, to lower rates and allow its customers to seek different energy options, analysts said. $(B1.$) Executive Quits At HarperCollins After less than a year as president and publisher of the HarperCollins trade publishing group, Jack McKeown has resigned, the company said. Mr. McKeown's responsibilities will be divided between David Steinberger, a management consultant at Booz, Allen & Hamilton, and Anthea Disney, the president and chief executive of HarperCollins Publishers. $(D4.$) Chinese Growth and Inflation Slow China's robust economy expanded at the slowest rate in five years during 1996. The gross domestic product rose 9.7 percent, down from 10.2 percent in 1995.
