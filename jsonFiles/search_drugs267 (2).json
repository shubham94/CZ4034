Dr. Louis Jack Vorhaus II, died peacefully at the age of 91 on Saturday, October 18th, 2014, attended by his daughter Meg. He was a dedicated physician and a great lover of life. He loved railroads, mountains, all animals (especially dogs), classical music, Harvard, ballet, orchids, children's books, the Supreme Court, Gilbert and Sullivan, good grammar.... the list goes on and on. Above all, he loved his children, Kathie, Meg, Niki and David, and his grandchildren and great grandchildren. He was kind and loyal and dependable. He was witty and opinionated. In his last years, he suffered from dementia, but was unfailingly optimistic, cheerful, and uncomplaining. He recognized his loved ones until the end, and though he couldn't remember what happened two minutes ago, he ranged in his last months through his distant past, singing songs, reciting poems, and recalling people. Born to Pauline Grossman Vorhaus and David Vorhaus, Louis grew up in Manhattan, and attended Birch Wathen School, where he was elected student council president. He was admitted to Harvard's class of 1944, and awarded an honorary academic scholarship. He went on to attend medical school at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he graduated Alpha Omega Alpha. He specialized in Internal Medicine. Louis Vorhaus served as a Captain in the Army Medical Nutrition Laboratory where he earned a Presidential Citation and during which time he served in the US Department of Health and Welfare, stationed in Turkey.
