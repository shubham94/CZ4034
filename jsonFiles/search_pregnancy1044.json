Although the 14-year-old is savvy enough to guess that they could be talking, say, to a grossly overweight man instead of some hot babe, his little brother suggests, ''Ask if she likes baloney,'' then innocently offers a nonsensical, physically impossible act that reminds us he is not so far from his potty training days. The online response is, ''You are crazy, and you are making me very hot.'' Precocious sexual knowledge -- far beyond what children and teenage characters can absorb, and often with devastating consequences -- has become a staple of current independent films. In the French film ''Lila Says,'' the title character is a 16-year-old whose wealth of sexual knowledge and free-wheeling behavior leads the town to think she may actually be a whore. In Gregg Araki's unexpectedly eloquent ''Mysterious Skin,'' two boys who are molested by their Little League coach grow up to be a teenage hustler and a guy who believes he was abducted by aliens. (All three films are playing in New York and a handful of other cities, and will expand to more cities through the next month or so.)
