If the farmers continue to prosper, they may retain what they have into the 21st century. If not, a pent-up demand for warehouse and distribution centers by retailers and manufacturers could swallow up whatever is available. Development is on the rise, enhanced by the presence of Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks and highway access to Interstates 91 and 84.", "snippet": "A THREE-YEAR resurgence of cigar smoking has lifted the spirits and lined the pockets of Connecticut's 10 shade tobacco growers, the last of a once-thriving industry that supported hundreds of farmers.
