But Bush, sitting one day recently on a sofa in the Governor's office at the Texas State Capitol, says he is ''cautious about wearing my religion on my sleeve in the political process.''

''Mother and I were arguing -- not arguing, having a discussion -- and discussing who goes to Heaven,'' recalls the Governor, who at the time had religion very much on his mind. Having dealt with a gathering drinking problem by abruptly swearing off alcohol, he had vowed a renewed commitment to his family and his faith. Bush pointed to the Bible: only Christians had a place in heaven. ''I said, Mom, look, all I can tell you is what the New Testament says. And she said, well, surely, God will accept others. And I said, Mom, here's what the New Testament says. And she said, O.K., and she picks up the phone and calls Billy Graham.
