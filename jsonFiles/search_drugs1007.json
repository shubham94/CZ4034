She stuffed two doctors' letters into a worn envelope, filled a plastic bag with prescription pills and enlisted her son as an interpreter. They traveled to a drab building off Union Square, where they waited for an hour in hard plastic chairs until a caseworker summoned them to a cramped cubicle. ''The reason we called you in,'' he began, ''is everybody on public assistance is required to work.'' The son, a jobless 21-year-old, answered through a mouthful of gum: ''Well, we got letters from her doctors saying she's not really able to work.''

Lowey Democrat of New York I rise in strong opposition to the resolution. Our founding fathers viewed impeachment as a mechanism of last resort to protect the nation from a President who threatened the Constitution or the American people. Throughout our history, members of Congress have appreciated the enormous gravity of impeachment, and that is why despite countless disputes, provocations, misdeeds and lies, the House has voted just once in its history to impeach a President. Indeed, the delicate system of constitutional checks and balances established by the founders works only insofar as each branch of Government exercises its prerogatives responsibly. In the case of impeachment, that means applying the most rigorous test to the use of our authority. The Constitution gives this body the ability to undo our only national election, but we must use that authority judiciously and cautiously. To do otherwise imperils the stability of our democracy, replacing the orderly transfer of power with the constant threat of political upheaval.", "headline": {"main": "The Debate on Articles of Impeachment Against President Clinton", "kicker": "IMPEACHMENT"}, "abstract": "Excerpts from statements by members of Congress during House debate over articles of impeachment against Pres Clinton; includes statements by Reprs Nita M Lowey, Carolyn C Kilpatrick, Edward J Markey, Howard Coble, James C Greenwood, Bernard Sanders, James F Sensenbrenner Jr, Ernest J Istook Jr, Luis V Gutierrez, Bill Delahunt, Jay Dickey, John Thune, John Edward Porter, Bruce F Vento, Marge Roukema, Ron Packard, Charles B Rangel, Charlie Norwood (L)", "print_page": "10", "word_count": 4756, "_id": "4fd1e15f8eb7c8105d7295af", "snippet": "Following are excerpts from the House debate today on article of impeachment against President Clinton, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription agency:    Nita M.
