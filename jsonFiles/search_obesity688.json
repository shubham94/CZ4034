Frieden, the small-of-scale envelope pusher who seems a perfect fit as New York City's health commissioner, sits an elegant metal bowl worthy of a C\u00e9zanne still life: all except for its contents. Rather than holding an arrangement of healthy fruit, or summery blooms, the bowl brims with condoms. Freebie condoms. Each is discreetly sheathed in white and, like a souvenir matchbook, stamped with a witty abbreviation: B.Y.O.C. Get the message? Visitors to 125 Worth Street apparently do. The bowl sees plenty of action and required a refill just this morning.
