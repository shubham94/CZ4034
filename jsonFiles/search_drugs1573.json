Officials in New York and other states say that such a requirement now poses few practical problems, because the number of such patients is small and because the rule is largely an extension of other safeguards. However, state mental-health officials say the patients who most often refuse medication come from a new and growing group - violent, young, predominantly male chronic patients whom psychiatrists describe as the most difficult cases because of their resistance to treatment and their propensity for violent outbursts. While 1 to 2 percent of all patients now refuse drug treatment, the officials said, the problem could worsen if the number of young patients - people from 18 to 35 years old - continues to increase, as it has over the last 10 years.", "headline": {"main": "NEW YORK COURT ADDS TO RULES FOR MANDATING MENTAL DRUGS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "27", "word_count": 671, "_id": "4fd15f818eb7c8105d6485b7", "snippet": "A decision by New York State's highest court has added New York to a growing number of states that require psychiatrists to go to court when they want to override a mental patient's refusal to take antipsychotic drugs.
