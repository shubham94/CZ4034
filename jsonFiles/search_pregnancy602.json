It stood to reason, we thought, that you could simply choose otherwise, provided, of course, that you wanted to. Now, however, thanks to Louann Brizendine, M.D., author of ''The Male Brain'' (Broadway Books), we understand that choosing otherwise isn't an option, because evolution has outfitted you with a brain that is, biologically speaking, not the same model as the one we were issued. (Brizendine's ''Female Brain'' was published in 2006, should you ever get the urge to consult it.) The epic bouts of road rage, the narcolepsy after sex, the fanatical fixation on the Big East standings, the hunger for movies full of gunfire and explosions -- finally, we get it. Brizendine fills us in on the male brain's larger areas devoted to muscular action, aggression and sex, formed before birth and modulated throughout life by an exquisitely calibrated blend of testosterone, M\u00fcllerian inhibiting substance, androstenedione, vasopressin and other hormones that alter perceptions and lay the groundwork for specific behaviors.", "headline": {"main": "Its a Guy Thing", "kicker": "TALK: BIBLIO FILE"}, "abstract": "Holly Brubach Biblio File reviews Louann Brizendine's new book The Male Brain and The Male Factor: The Unwritten Rules, Misperceptions, and Secret Beliefs of Men in the Workplace by Shaunti Feldhahn; photo (M)", "print_page": "84", "word_count": 925, "_id": "4fd27bdf8eb7c8105d8416a3", "snippet": "Guys, we've got your playbook.
