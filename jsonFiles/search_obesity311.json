Chris Pine, above right with Mr. Washington, is Will Colson, the new, hotheaded conductor Frank is charged with training. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said that Mr. Scott, working with the cinematographer Ben Seresin and some ace sound technicians, ''creates an unexpectedly rich world of chugging, rushing trains slicing across equally beautiful industrial and natural landscapes,'' adding, ''There is something mesmerizing about these trains and the men who run them, something nostalgic too, because they seem like history machines, summoning up a past lived and also imagined, as in, for starters, 'The Great Train Robbery' (1903), 'North by Northwest' (1959) and 'Speed' (1994).' '' Alas, she said, '' 'Unstoppable' doesn't belong in that company: its story is largely forgettable, and its pleasures are transitory, limited to the actors (including Rosario Dawson and Kevin Corrigan, working up a sweat back in dispatch) and to its moments of beauty and strange comedy.'' Still, despite some ridiculous action flourishes from Mr. Scott, ''with a handful of appealing actors in tow, he sure keeps that machine going.'' NOON (13) RICHARD HEFFNER'S OPEN MIND Richard W.
