That's close to 15,000 pills a year. When I first tested positive, I had a dream that I was walking down the street shaking like a baby's rattle because there were so many pills inside me. Eight years later, that shaking has become white noise. I asked my pharmacist the other day to tote up the annual bill (which my insurance mercifully pays): $15,600, easily more than I pay separately for housing, food, travel or clothes. I'm an extreme case -- along with many others now living relatively normally with chronic illnesses -- but I'm not completely atypical. Over the last decade, as new and better prescription drugs have become our primary form of health care, our common spending on them has soared. In 1999 alone, according to a study conducted by an independent consulting group, overall expenditure on prescription drugs in America rose by 19 percent -- but only 4 percent of that was because of increased prices.
