A small ark of animals has been rescued from a building on 44th Street, including 12 cats, 2 illegal ferrets, several goldfish, one cockatiel, a guinea pig, a gerbil and a hamster. Except for those areas in the shadow of the Conde Nast building, where loose scaffolding caused part of an elevator tower to break away a week ago, crashing into a residential hotel and killing an elderly woman, Times Square is almost back to normal. With most of the city's crossroads reopened, and with the breakaway scaffolding slowly being secured with what one television reporter called ''our giant nylon stocking,'' this is a good time to find out what really happened. Speculation is now focusing on the possibility that beams holding the scaffolding to the building on the 21st floor may not have been properly fastened by contractors working on the facade. Workers often remove the beams holding the elevator tower while they apply the facade. The question is whether someone neglected to re-attach the beams or whether they were somehow wrenched from the building in the accident.", "headline": {"main": "The Return, Almost, of Times Square"}, "abstract": "Editorial urges New York City to insure that construction can safely proceed on Conde Nast building in Times Square following accident in which scaffolding collapsed; says its must make sure report on cause of accident is finished quickly and used to help prevent similar mishaps in high-density city (S)", "print_page": "14", "word_count": 350, "_id": "4fd1eb018eb7c8105d73b6ac", "snippet": "The blare of traffic is back.
