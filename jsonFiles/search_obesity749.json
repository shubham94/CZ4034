The source of the tantalizing aromas was one of Mrs. Heinz Kerry's favorite dishes, a fish soup. It was simmering on a Wolf stove in a kitchen filled with all the modern accouterments of the serious cook: a huge center island with a granite top, a Sub-Zero refrigerator; copper pots hanging from the ceiling. A rosemary bush sat on a table inlaid with old blue and white Portuguese tiles.", "snippet": "The wife of the Democratic candidate for president talks as knowledgeably about food safety as she does about classic French sauces.", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "HEINZ KERRY, TERESA", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "DIET AND NUTRITION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2004", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "FOOD", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "6", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 1707, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": [{"legacy": {"thumbnailheight": 75, "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnail": "images/2004/10/13/dining/13tere.75.jpg"}, "height": 75, "type": "image", "url": "images/2004/10/13/dining/13tere.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail"}]}, {"news_desk": "Foreign Desk", "document_type": "article", "_id": "4fd259b38eb7c8105d8062ad", "headline": {"main": "World Briefing | Asia: China: Eating Giant Awakens"}, "pub_date": "2004-10-13T00:00:00Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "source": "Agence France-Presse", "byline": null, "abstract": "China's Deputy Health Minister Wang Longde reports that number of obese people in China has doubled to 60 million from 1992 to 2002; warns problem will get worse (S)", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E5D81E3BF930A25753C1A9629C8B63", "section_name": "World", "lead_paragraph": "The number of obese people in China doubled to 60 million people from 1992 to 2002, with diseases related to an unhealthy diet and way of life also on the rise, the government said.

''The Chinese population does not have enough awareness and lacks knowledge of what is a reasonable nutrition and diet,'' he said. Having themselves suffered from inadequate food in their youth, grandparents and parents often stuff young children with excessive amounts of food. Less physical activity -- with fewer Chinese having to do physical labor for a living and many now driving cars instead of cycling or walking -- has also contributed to the problems of overweight, obesity, diabetes and abnormal blood lipid levels, the study found.", "snippet": "The number of obese people in China doubled to 60 million people from 1992 to 2002, with diseases related to an unhealthy diet and way of life also on the rise, the government said.
