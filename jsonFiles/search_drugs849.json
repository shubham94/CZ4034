Of these, as the endless daily parade of desperation and diagnoses makes evident, it is pain whose presence predominates. ''Yes, yes,'' sighs Dr. Daniel Carr, who is the clinic's medical director.

By the time most patients make their way to a pain clinic, it's very late.'' What the majority of doctors see in a chronic-pain patient is an overwhelming, off-putting ruin: a ruined body and a ruined life.
