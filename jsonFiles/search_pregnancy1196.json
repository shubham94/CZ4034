Seven years after Congress rewrote the rules in an effort to end long-term dependency on benefits, hundreds of thousands of Americans have moved from welfare to work, many of them substantially raising their incomes. Some also credit the new law for a rise in marriage and cohabitation by single mothers and a decline in the teenage pregnancy rate. But several recent studies by state governments and urban-policy researchers point to a result that has been less obvious and slower to emerge: a significant number of those who have left the welfare rolls have no jobs, and are sinking deeper into poverty.", "headline": {"main": "Are Those Leaving Welfare Better Off Now?

Taylor then volunteered to ship her breast milk from her town of Paola, Kan., to the twins about 500 miles away. ''I wanted to give them a good start, like I did with my own,'' she says. Taylor stores the milk in her freezer in 20-ounce, presterilized water bottles she buys in bulk.

The case raises the perplexing question of whether tough regulation in this country is driving promising work abroad or is simply protecting American women from experimental procedures that could endanger their health or that of any resulting offspring. The technique was pioneered by Dr. James Grifo of the New York University School of Medicine in an effort to help infertile women whose eggs, though fertilized by sperm, are unable to develop because of defects in the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus of each egg cell. To circumvent that problem, the nucleus from an infertile woman's fertilized egg is removed and transferred to a healthier egg, from another woman, that has had its own nucleus removed. The resulting hybrid egg is then placed in the infertile woman's womb, where, if all goes well, it will develop into a healthy baby.", "headline": {"main": "Experimenting With Human Fertility"}, "abstract": "Editorial says doctors in China achieved first pregnancy in infertile woman using technique that was devised in United States but then dropped when its chief advocate shied away from seeking regulatory approval; questions whether tough regulation in US is driving promising work abroad or is simply protecting American women from experimental procedures that could endanger their health or that of any resulting offspring; notes Chinese government banned further use of technique following deaths of three developing fetuses", "print_page": "28", "word_count": 380, "_id": "4fd24b208eb7c8105d7ea05d", "snippet": "Doctors in China have achieved the first pregnancy in an infertile woman using a technique that was devised in the United States but dropped here when its chief advocate shied away from seeking regulatory approval.
