One way for Americans to judge more easily the effectiveness of the new legislation, and of our health care system as a whole, is to adapt a leading tool of political economics: the misery index. Most people are familiar with the economic misery index, which is calculated by adding the percentage of Americans out of work to the general inflation rate. It was devised by Arthur Okun, an adviser to Jimmy Carter during the 1976 presidential election campaign, and was used to demonstrate how troubled the economy had become under President Gerald Ford.
