''There had been a lot of speculation as to what it would look like,'' said James D. McNeil, senior patent attorney for Miles Laboratories Inc., noting both the broad sweep of the patent claim and its status as the first one issued that covers gene-splicing techniques. ''Basically, it looks as if they are trying to make licensing palatable.'' The centerpiece of that effort is a royalty structure so low that users should find it cheaper to pay up rather than fight. If the strategy works, the two universities, under a program they have agreed Stanford will administer, will receive tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars for more research, and the new industry will have a chance to establish itself on firmer economic footing before it becomes encumbered with costly patent litigation.", "headline": {"main": "LICENSES FOR GENE-SPLICING"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1236, "_id": "4fd119818eb7c8105d5d27fc", "snippet": "Gene-splicing recently passed a major milestone on its journey from the laboratory to the marketplace with Stanford University's issuance of a nonexclusive licensing agreement covering the use of patented splicing techniques invented by researchers...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/19/business/licenses-for-gene-splicing.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "CALIFORNIA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GENETICS AND HEREDITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INVENTIONS AND INVENTORS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Barnaby", "middlename": "J.", "lastname": "FEDER", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By BARNABY J.

His works have been reproduced so often, in so many places, that they were part of us before we knew his name. More likely than not, we learned his name when we found out who he was. To read or hear about Modigliani is to remember him. He was one of the landmarks of the Belle Epoque, an habitue of the great cafes of Montparnasse, a grand bohemian who knew and drew or painted a who's who of early 20th-century artists and writers. More than anything, Modigliani was one of the peintres maudits. He created and destroyed himself at the same time. His devotion to art went hand-in-hand with a relentless consumption of drugs and alcohol that left him physically wasted and helpless before the tuberculosis that had been shadowing him since he was a child. When the disease of the Romantics finally nailed him, in 1920, he was 35, and his work was finally beginning to acquire a reputation.", "headline": {"main": "MODIGLIANI--THE BOHEMIAN"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "23", "word_count": 1579, "_id": "4fd11d028eb7c8105d5daaf6", "snippet": "Modigliani is one of the most familiar 20th-century artists.
