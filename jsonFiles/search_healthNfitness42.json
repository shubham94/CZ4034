THE FACTS -- Up until about 1970, millions of glow-in-the-dark watches sold in the United States were made with radium, a radioactive substance that was painted on watch dials to give them their characteristic luminosity. Radium was eventually banned after scores of dial painters died from cancer and various ghastly ailments. But many of the so-called radium watches are still around today, considered antiques and even prized as collectibles. The watches are likely to emit as much radiation today as they did when they were first manufactured, but experts say that in reality, the risk to wearers is probably low.", "headline": {"main": "REALLY?"}, "abstract": "Research shows that old watches and clocks that have radium dials pose no health threat unless watches or clocks are opened and dial face is tinkered with; drawing (M)", "print_page": "6", "word_count": 278, "_id": "4fd2aec18eb7c8105d89cdfb", "snippet": "THE CLAIM -- Antique watches made with radium can emit high levels of radiation.

Experts surmise that ''modern lifestyles'' and the accompanying stress of too much to do in too little time are largely responsible for the growing need for the drugs. That may be true. But I see an altogether different explanation for the flagrant use of sleeping pills. In the last decade, there has been a sea change in the kinds of drugs available to induce sleep, and these drugs have been widely promoted in print and on television. You could hardly have missed that pale green luna moth (sans antennas) drifting over peaceful sleepers in ads for Lunesta, which has joined Ambien, Sonata and others in a new class of sleep aid. A Tempting Offer How tempting it is when people hear that, say, five milligrams of Ambien can temporarily sweep their worries under the mattress, allow them to fall asleep within 15 minutes and awaken the next morning refreshed and raring to go.
