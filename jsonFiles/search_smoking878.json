Although there is no dispute that low concentrations of cholesterol in the blood protect people from heart disease, there also seems to be a newly found, but sometimes grudging, agreement that very low cholesterol levels make death from other causes more likely. Several studies pointing to a risk from low cholesterol levels have appeared this year, with more awaiting publication. These studies, based on data from hundreds of thousands of people, show that people who have extra-low levels of cholesterol in their blood are more likely to die in later years from a variety of causes, including suicide, homicide, strokes, certain cancers, liver disease and lung disease. In fact, the deaths from these other causes mount so quickly that the mortality rate for those with low cholesterol levels equals the rate for people with very high cholesterol levels, who are likely to die from heart disease.", "snippet": "SLOWLY and hesitantly, leading heart disease researchers are concluding that there seems to be a dark side to having especially low cholesterol levels.
