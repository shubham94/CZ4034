This year I was worried. The last I had seen of the dazzling orange patriarch, he was bravely, desperately leading a screeching redtail hawk away from his brood. Then they all vanished. Thus when Daddy-O returned this spring, I rejoiced -- and followed the flash of wings to the hammocklike nest swinging high in our maple tree. The fledging of the ensuing baby orioles took place at a tender time in our human nest; our 16-year-old son, Sam, had gotten his driver's permit. It was a milestone I've dreaded since he began taking solid food. So it was only natural that I would do the sappy Mom thing and anthropomorphize the avian drama. I envied Mama Oriole her apparent sangfroid as the baby birds plunged, flapping, into the void. The female chick was cautious, taking short test flights to nearby branches. Her two snazzy brothers favored the kamikaze approach; death-defying free falls landed them, tweeting and flailing, in the trumpet vine. Every time they made it back to the nest, a squawky fracas ensued that sounded to my fretful maternal ears like a warbled equivalent of ''What were you thinking?''", "headline": {"main": "Teaching New Motor Skills, and Stepping Aside", "kicker": "GENERATIONS"}, "abstract": "Gerri Hirshey Generations essay on trials and tribulations of teaching teenage son to be responsible driver who will follow rules governing restricted licenses; drawing (M)", "print_page": "7", "word_count": 1349, "_id": "4fd253ff8eb7c8105d7fa9c5", "snippet": "FOR the past five springs, a pair of Baltimore Orioles has returned to our yard to nest.
