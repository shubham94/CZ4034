A series of new studies show that left-handed people are more likely to suffer from learning disabilities, stuttering, migraine headaches and, according to the latest findings, autoimmune diseases, like ulcerative colitis, myasthenia gravis and celiac disease, in which the body attacks its own tissues. The researchers emphasize, however, that their findings do not mean that left-handed people are at a biological disadvantage. Rather, they consider left-handedness an example of ''biological diversity'' that may be disadvantageous in some ways and beneficial in others. ''Until you look at the full range of conditions and overall life expectancy among left-handed people, you cannot say whether it's a disadvantage,'' said Dr. Norman Geschwind, a leading researcher in the field. ''It could be that left-handed people have only half the rate of lung cancer that right-handed people do.''", "headline": {"main": "SOME DISORDERS APPEAR TO BE LINKED TO BEING LEFT-HANDED"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1484, "_id": "4fd12b288eb7c8105d5f43b6", "snippet": "HANDED people, already burdened by minor inconveniences in a right-handed world and by a language full of such ego-deflating figures of speech as two left feet, out in left field and left-handed compliment, also seem to face an increased risk of...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/19/science/some-disorders-appear-to-be-linked-to-being-left-handed.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Jane", "middlename": "E.", "lastname": "BRODY", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By JANE E.
