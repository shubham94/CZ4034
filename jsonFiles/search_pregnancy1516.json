He is the most modest (and the least tendentious) of the brilliant Jewish boys who attended City College 60 years ago and later came to be known collectively as the New York Intellectuals. The City College crowd helped chart postwar America's ideological frontier; like many of his classmates, Glazer journeyed steadily rightward for decades, from Trotskyist to social democrat to neo-conservative. But lately, Glazer has begun to adopt -- though scarcely embrace -- some strikingly liberal positions. This spring, Glazer wrote in The New Republic that without affirmative action, hardly any blacks would gain admission to top colleges; and that, he argued, would ''undermine the legitimacy of American democracy.'' Glazer seemed resigned rather than enthusiastic, but it was nonetheless a startling reversal from a scholar who two decades earlier wrote ''Affirmative Discrimination,'' a stinging critique of racial (and other) preferences. Such is Glazer's prestige, and his reputation for intellectual honesty, that in some liberal precincts his anguished turnaround has been celebrated as a portent of a conservative crack-up, at least on issues of race. Well, perhaps. But it's also possible to read in the 50-year arc of Glazer's career a terrible dashing of the hopes that liberalism itself once rested upon. In books like ''Beyond the Melting Pot,'' which he wrote with Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and in countless essays, Glazer, who for nearly 30 years has been a sociology professor at Harvard, advanced a vision of a pluralistic culture that offered a niche to each new group that came to our shores, while encouraging -- at times compelling -- assimilation into the larger society.", "headline": {"main": "Nathan Glazer Changes His Mind, Again"}, "abstract": "Nathan Glazer, Harvard sociologist who was one of first, and fiercest, critics of affirmative action, explains why he now supports it; he recently wrote in The New Republic that without affirmative action, hardly any blacks would gain admission to top colleges, an event that would undermine legitimacy of American democracy; Glazer says he has concluded that dynamic of assimilation and progress that appeared to apply to every American does not apply to blacks; traces this failure to unwillingness of whites to permit blacks to assimilate; says also that historical experience of black Americans makes it impossible for them to completely absorb immigrant values of starting at bottom and working their way up; he has not changed his view that government activism on behalf of poor is largely self-defeating; he is in awkward position of accepting left's diagnosis of black prospects while denying efficacy of its proposed cure; photos (L)", "print_page": "23", "word_count": 2931, "_id": "4fd1eaff8eb7c8105d73b558", "snippet": "Nathan Glazer has had more second thoughts in his lifetime than most people have had thoughts.
