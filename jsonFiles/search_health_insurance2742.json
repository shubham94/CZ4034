A1 117 Feared Dead After Crash A passenger plane carrying 117 people crashed in a town 30 miles north of Nigeria's commercial capital, Lagos, after passing through an electrical storm shortly after takeoff. No survivors were found in the wreckage. A12 Strategy on North Korea The Bush administration is expanding what it calls ''defensive measures'' against North Korea, urging nations from China to the former Soviet states to deny overflight rights to aircraft that the United States believes are carrying weapons technology. A7 Hariri's Son Calls for Tribunal The son of Lebanon's slain former prime minister, Rafik Hariri, and the leader of the country's Druse minority called for an international tribunal to try suspects connected with the assassination, as the United States and Britain stepped up a campaign to place international sanctions on Syria. A12 Israel Hedges on Opposition Israel began to back away from its opposition to participation of the armed Islamic group Hamas in Palestinian elections, having failed to persuade President Bush to offer public support for its stance. A12 Afghan Journalist Convicted The editor of a magazine called Women's Rights was sentenced to two years in prison by the primary court in Kabul. He is the first journalist to be convicted under the country's blasphemy laws since the fall of the Taliban's Islamic government. A3 Ukraine Confident on NATO The defense minister of Ukraine expressed confidence that Russia would not block his nation's efforts to join NATO, and he said the greater hurdle might be convincing a population that for decades was bathed in Soviet propaganda criticizing the Atlantic alliance. A13 NATIONAL A14-18 Hurricane Wilma Churns Toward Florida Coast Hurricane Wilma churned toward heavily populated southwestern Florida and the Florida Keys, having weakened after pounding Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Coast but still packing winds of more than 100 miles an hour and the power to bring devastating storm surges. The edge of the hurricane was expected to strike the Gulf Coast of Florida as a Category 2 or Category 3 storm. Tropical storm winds of up to 70 miles an hour were predicted as far north as Tampa. A1 Rebuilding in New Orleans Residents of the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans worry that outsiders, who may have viewed the ward as a blighted area whose residents did not have much to lose, would be willing to write off their neighborhood as a casualty of the disaster, a neighborhood not worth the expense of rebuilding and storm-proofing. The area is still closed and residents are denied access. A1 Strategy for Leak Case With a decision expected on possible indictments in the C.I.A. leak case, allies of the White House suggested that they intended to pursue a strategy of attacking any criminal charges as disagreements over legal technicalities or products of an overzealous prosecutor. A1 Poor Support for Levees When engineers started to design a floodwall on the 17th Street Canal in New Orleans in the early 1980's, deep probes found what geologists viewed as a potentially weak layer of peat soil about 15 feet below sea level in the area where the wall collapsed during Hurricane Katrina. Yet in building the wall, corps officials acknowledge that they did not drive the main anchors for the structure any deeper than 17 feet. A17 Record Opposition for Miers Harriet E. Miers, President Bush's nominee to succeed Justice O'Conner, does have the advantage of five years in the White House and one year as its counsel. But in just three weeks, her nomination has provoked a broad range of opposition that some scholars say may have no precedent in the modern history of Supreme Court nominees. A14 NEW YORK/REGION B1-6 Mayor Calls for Removal Of Ground Zero Developer Mayor Bloomberg called for the removal of the developer of private office space at ground zero, Larry A. Silverstein, and an even broader rethinking of plans, including adding housing to the mix. A1 Bronx Terminal Plan Criticized The Bronx Terminal Market's potential as a retail center is so promising that the Bloomberg administration did not need to promise deep subsidies to the developer chosen to transform the crumbling site into a gleaming $394 million shopping mall, critics say. B1 SPORTSMONDAY D1-12 White Sox Win Again The Chicago White Sox defeated the Houston Astros, 7-6, in Game 2 of the World Series. Paul Konerko hit a grand slam in the seventh inning, and Scott Podsednik hit the game-ending home run. Chicago leads the series 2-0. D1 ARTS E1-12 Remaking a Czech Icon Producers in Prague are planning to reinvent Maj. Jan Zeman, a Czech Communist television detective, as an agent of the West in a new film to be shot this spring. For some, it is a revisionist take akin to depicting James Bond as a Communist. Former Czech dissidents and political prisoners consider any revival of the character offensive. E1 Changing Focus at Frankfurt In the age of e-mail, the Frankfurt Book Fair, which was for decades the main place publishers met to trade the rights for translating and publishing books, is increasingly shifting to more of a social event for publishers. E1 OBITUARIES B7 Arman The French sculptor known internationally for his surprising accumulations of found objects, he was 76. B7 BUSINESS DAY C1-12 Wal-Mart Offers Health Plan Wal-Mart, which has long been criticized for the benefits it offers to its workers, is introducing a cheaper health insurance plan, with monthly premiums as low as $11, that the company hopes will increase the number of employees who can afford coverage. C1 Village Voice to Be Sold The company that publishes The Village Voice and five other alternative newspapers is to announce an agreement to be acquired by New Times Media. The deal would create a chain of 17 free weekly newspapers around the country with a combined circulation of 1.8 million. C1 King Kong Comes to Consoles Major movie studios, with their vast libraries, want to make their own games. And video game companies are seeking new Hollywood-style franchises to compete. Peter Jackson, who directed the remake of ''King Kong,'' also co-developed a video game for the movie. C1 Unraveling Mystery at Refco Peter F. James, an employee at the controller's office at Refco, is credited with the discovery of irregularities that led to the company's filing for bankruptcy this week. Now questions are mounting over why others never made such discoveries.

Charges in Deaths Despite indications of Central Intelligence Agency involvement in the deaths of at least four prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan, C.I.A. employees now appear likely to escape criminal charges in all but one of those incidents, according to current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials. 6 Hurricane Still Lashing Canc\u00fan Hurricane Wilma stalled over Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, pounding the beach resorts of Canc\u00fan and Playa del Carmen and stranding tens of thousands of tourists in hot, leaky shelters while a maelstrom of howling winds, uprooted trees and hurtling debris raged on all sides. 1 Injured Are Dying in Pakistan After the earthquake in Pakistan that killed more than 53,000 people, wounds and injuries that have not received medical attention are contributing to a second wave of deaths. The problem is not only the shortage of help; it is the magnitude of the destruction, and time is the enemy. 14 U.N. Details Syrian Plot The United Nations report on the killing of Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister of Lebanon, traces in detail months of plotting by top Syrian intelligence officials, including President Bashar al-Assad's powerful brother-in-law, and their Lebanese proxies that included constant surveillance of Mr. Hariri's movements. 16 NATIONAL 18-30 Health Care to Bankruptcy Never before have patients had so many medical options to extend, enrich or alter their lives. But these new options are expensive, and with them has come a change for which many Americans -- even those with health insurance -- are financially ill prepared. 1 New Orleans Houses to Fall As crews begin inspecting thousands of rotting houses in New Orleans and preservationists begin efforts to save them, city and federal officials say that 30,000 to 50,000 of the city's houses, or up to a quarter of the city's housing stock, will probably have to be demolished. 1 Dynamics of Disaster Giving Donations for the victims of the earthquake that ripped through Pakistan and India have not come even close to the level of giving that followed the tsunami that wreaked havoc around the rim of the Indian Ocean or Hurricane Katrina, which destroyed a huge swath of the Gulf Coast. But fund-raising experts say the generosity directed toward the victims of those disasters was rare. 18 Trying to Monitor E-Mail The federal government is requiring hundreds of universities, private companies and cities to overhaul their Internet computer networks to make it easier for law enforcement authorities to monitor e-mail and other online communications. 1 Nominee Supported Diversity When President Bush's latest Supreme Court nominee, Harriet E. Miers, was moving toward the presidency of the State Bar of Texas in 1992, she supported an effort by the group to guarantee positions on its board of directors to female and minority lawyers, her two immediate predecessors said. The current attorney general was among the first lawyers to win appointment to the board under the program. 30 SPORTSSUNDAY 1-14 White Sox Win Game 1 In Game 1 of the World Series, the Chicago White Sox defeated the Houston Astros, 5-3.
