A bag of Pampers spills across the floor beside boxes of juice bottles and soda cans, stashed so the older kids won't drink them. Mounds of laundry flank the bed -- clean to the north, dirty to the south -- as bare-chested men on TV chant about pistols and weed. ''I been having this TV forever,'' the father says with a yawn. ''Bought it in, like, '96 from a hype'' -- a drug addict. ''Gave her two bags for it. It was like 6 o'clock in the morning. She was fiending for a hit.'' The father is six feet tall with a linebacker build, copper skin and soft hair, which until recently he kept in a ponytail. He says that light skin and long hair, a lure for women, were among his main assets when he worked as a drug dealer and pimp. So were quick fists. ''You can pay me or pay the doctor,'' he used to say. His boxer shorts end just above a three-inch scar from a prison knife and cover the gunshot wound in the groin that nearly killed him.
