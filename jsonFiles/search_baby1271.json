When she asks if they want fruits, vegetables and meat that stay fresher longer, they say yes. But when she mentions a preservation technique that promises to make those things possible, they respond, she says, by asking such half-serious questions as ''Does it make you glow in the dark?'' The technique is irradiation - exposing foods to gamma rays or electrons emitted by radioactive materials - and it may soon do to some consumer foods in this country what it has long done to cosmetics, hospital equipment, baby powders and meals astronauts have eaten on the moon and in orbit: kill off substantial amounts of bacteria in food or sterilize it altogether. The food itself does not become radioactive, just as dental and chest X-rays do not make teeth and lungs radioactive. In low doses, irradiation has little effect on taste.", "headline": {"main": "IRRADIATED FOOD: PROMISE AND CONTROVERSY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1738, "_id": "4fd125968eb7c8105d5ebdee", "snippet": "WHEN Mona Doyle, a marketing pollster, asks people if they want alternatives to the chemical preservatives in their food, most of them say yes.
