It takes less than three days to turn even large gallstones into a fluid with the experimental technique. Dissolution results from the action of a liquid called methyl tert-butyl ether, MTBE, a chemical cousin of the diethyl ether that has been used in surgery as a general anesthetic for more than a century. The ether preparation is injected through a thin tube that pierces the skin and is guided through the liver to enter the gallbladder. The stones that form there afflict up to 20 million Americans and come in a variety of sizes, shapes and chemical compositions. The ether solution can dissolve cholesterol gallstones, the most common type.", "headline": {"main": "GALLSTONES REMOVED WITHOUT MAJOR SURGERY", "kicker": "THE DOCTOR'S WORLD"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1865, "_id": "4fd150238eb7c8105d630e15", "snippet": "GALLSTONES - a vexing health problem affecting millions of Americans and normally requiring major surgery or long-term treatment with pills - can often be quickly dissolved in the body with a new method devised by doctors in Minnesota.
