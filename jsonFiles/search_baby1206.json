Medical scientists consider chimpanzees, the closest relative to humans in the animal world, to be indispensable for certain experiments, including future tests of vaccines against AIDS. The projected decline in research animals has engendered wide concern. Since the mid-1970's, no imports have been permitted of chimpanzees caught in the wilds of Africa, where the species is threatened. Hundreds of the animals have been bred in captivity. But without new measures, scientists say, the future availability of chimpanzees will be endangered by two trends.", "headline": {"main": "WILL THERE BE ENOUGH CHIMPS FOR RESEARCH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2229, "_id": "4fd164768eb7c8105d6510ba", "snippet": "WITH the nation's future supply of research chimpanzees in jeopardy, Federal authorities plan to create a special population of 350 pampered animals that would be exempted from medical duties and enjoy emotionally rich upbringings designed to enhance...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/19/science/will-there-be-enough-chimps-for-research.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK UNIVERSITY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "EXPERIMENTAL MEDICAL AND SURGERY IN PRIMATES, LABORATORY FOR"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MONKEYS AND APES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REPRODUCTION (BIOLOGICAL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEPATITIS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Erik", "lastname": "ECKHOLM"}], "original": "By ERIK ECKHOLM"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1985-11-19T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Science; Health"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Long Island Weekly Desk", "lead_paragraph": "IN most Long Island waters, the scallop-harvesting season is only a month old, yet for baymen on the East End it is virtually over.
