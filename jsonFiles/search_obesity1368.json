For eight weeks, two groups of adult animals were fed diets that contained approximately the same number of calories. But the food fed one group contained 25 percent of its calories in protein, whereas the other group received only 5 percent of its calories in protein. Fat content in both diets was the same, about 10 percent of calories. The difference was made up in carbohydrates, mostly starches.", "snippet": "THE popular belief among dieters that it is easiest to lose unwanted pounds of fat on a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet has been challenged by an experiment in rats at the University of Virginia.

By ARLENE FISCHER ''WHEN you're fat you feel different from the other kids, like there's something wrong with you,'' said 10-year-old Julie, who six months ago weighed 93 pounds, about 15 pounds over her ideal weight. ''You're out of breath a lot, you're jealous of the skinny kids, sometimes you lie about eating and you end up being really mad at yourself and everybody else.'' An overweight child may carry a much greater burden than extra pounds, and the parents may also find the situation stressful. ''My daughter couldn't stop eating,'' said the mother of a 12-year-old girl, Susan, who was 5-foot-1 but weighed 127 pounds. ''At school she traded her diet lunches for pizza and potato chips. I hoped Susan would slim down on her own, but she was out of control. She put on 20 pounds in six months.''", "snippet": "--------------------------------------------------------------------  Arlene Fischer is a freelance writer.
