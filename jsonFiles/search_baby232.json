That document appeared to blame the previous finance minister, P Chidambaram, for failing to prevent the scam. According to a two-page letter from the current finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, to the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, the note was drafted after detailed consultations with the prime minister's office and the cabinet secretariat, and issued at the behest of the prime minister's office.
