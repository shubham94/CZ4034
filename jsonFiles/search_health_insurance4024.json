Brian McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council, the umbrella group for the city's 1.5 million union members, said this new thrust was intended to improve wages and working conditions for immigrants who he said are the most exploited class in the city's work force. At a breakfast that kicked off the belated Labor Day parade, Mr. McLaughlin said yesterday that the city's labor council would throw its weight behind an effort to unionize 10,000 limousine drivers, many of whom earn less than $20,000 a year even though they often work 70-hour weeks. He said the labor council would also back other organizing efforts aimed at immigrant workers. ''In this city, workers are increasingly minorities, women and immigrants,'' Mr. McLaughlin said in an interview. ''New immigrants are usually the most exploited people in the city. By joining unions they can gain from collective bargaining, which can increase their wages and win them health insurance and other benefits.'' Labor unions, he noted, have often helped nonunion immigrant workers, by, for example, lobbying Congress successfully to raise the minimum wage, which rose on Sept. 1 to $5.15 an hour. Mr. McLaughlin said the labor movement was working to strengthen its ties with the city's Dominican, Haitian and Asian leaders to spread the word to immigrants about the advantages of unions. As an example of cooperation between unions and immigrant groups, he said they would join to push for the $2.4 billion bond referendum to build and renovate schools throughout New York State. He said the measure would improve education for immigrant children while creating 18,000 construction jobs. Mr. McLaughlin said he began pushing to have the labor movement focus more on immigrant workers after reading about the Domsey Fabric factory in Brooklyn, which dismissed several workers for supporting a union, called some employees monkeys and required a pass for female workers to go to the bathroom. Most of the factory's workers were from Haiti. Four years after the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the company had to reinstate wrongfully dismissed workers and pay $2 million in back pay, hardly anything has been paid. The central labor council has persuaded Representatives Gary L. Ackerman, a Democrat from Queens and Long Island, and Nydia M. Velazquez, a Brooklyn Democrat, to introduce legislation that would discourage employers from mistreating workers the way Domsey did. Their bill would allow workers who were wrongfully dismissed for supporting a union to sue for punitive damages. Under current law, such workers can receive only back pay for the work they missed before being reinstated. The bill would also empower the National Labor Relations Board to issue injunctions. Under current law, the board must ask Federal judges to issue injunctions enforcing the board's decisions. ''We must send a message to unscrupulous employers: if you interfere with the basic rights of workers to organize, you'll receive more than a slap on the wrist,'' Mr. McLaughlin said. John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., was grand marshal of yesterday's parade, which marched up Fifth Avenue. At yesterday's breakfast at the Intercontinental Hotel and again at the parade, labor leaders and union members repeatedly hailed him for reviving the long-moribund labor movement. Last year, the labor council decided to move the parade from Labor Day to the following Saturday, to avoid conflicts with vacations.", "headline": {"main": "City Unions Turn Focus on Immigrants", "kicker": "RACE FOR CITY HALL: LABOR"}, "abstract": "Brian McLaughlin, president of New York Central Labor Council, umbrella group for city's 1.5 million union members, kicks off Labor Day parade by announcing that city's unions will increasingly focus on helping and recruiting hundreds of thousands of immigrants who often work for low pay and under harsh conditions; photos (M)", "print_page": "46", "word_count": 595, "_id": "4fd1d7f48eb7c8105d71653e", "snippet": "The head of New York City's labor movement announced yesterday that the city's unions would increasingly focus on helping and recruiting hundreds of thousands of immigrants who often work for low pay under harsh conditions.
