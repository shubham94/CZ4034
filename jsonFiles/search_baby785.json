Considering her heavy Lithuanian accent and how she shrank from dealing with authority, I thought she'd surely need help getting along. ''Are you kidding?'' she exclaimed. Managing her affairs became her work and her pride, and it soon occurred to me that this was the first time that she, traditional wife, had ever experienced autonomy. Every few days she would make her rounds to the bank, the doctor, the class in calligraphy. Then, in her personal brand of English, she would make her telephone rounds. She would complain that waiting for her pension check was ''like sitting on pins and noodles'' or entreat her granddaughter to stop spending money ''like a drunken driver.'' Proudly, stubbornly, she managed on her own for 18 years. And even then, at 83, frustrated by strokes and angry at the very the thought of a nursing home, she refused to eat. In days, she made herself die. Reflecting on those last days, I realize that the striking thing was not her death but those 18 years of later life. For almost all that time, she had the health and the modest income to live on her own terms. She could travel if she chose, or send birthday checks to family members, or buy yet another pair of shoes.
