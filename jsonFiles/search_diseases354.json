The researchers were interested in the men's exercise habits, but they also asked, almost incidentally, about their indolence. Specifically, they inquired about how many hours each day the men spent watching television or sitting in a car. (This was before you could do both at once.) Over the years, the survey's main results were used to reinforce a growing body of science about the health benefits of regular exercise. But the information about the amount of time the men spent being inactive remained largely unexplored. Recently, however, scientists from the University of South Carolina and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., parsed the full data. In a study published in May in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, they reported that, to no one's surprise, the men who sat the most had the greatest risk of heart problems. Men who spent more than 23 hours a week watching TV and sitting in their cars (as passengers or as drivers) had a 64 percent greater chance of dying from heart disease than those who sat for 11 hours a week or less. What was unexpected was that many of the men who sat long hours and developed heart problems also exercised. Quite a few of them said they did so regularly and led active lifestyles. The men worked out, then sat in cars and in front of televisions for hours, and their risk of heart disease soared, despite the exercise. Their workouts did not counteract the ill effects of sitting.", "headline": {"main": "PHYS ED; The Men Who Stare at Screens", "kicker": "WELL"}, "abstract": "Gretchen Reynolds Phys Ed column calls attention to study published in journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise that found that even for adults who exercise regularly, hours of sitting can increase risk of cardiovascular disease; illustration (M)", "print_page": "18", "word_count": 791, "_id": "4fd29aa38eb7c8105d87a073", "snippet": "In 1982, researchers affiliated with the Cooper Institute in Dallas  surveyed a large group of well-educated, affluent men.
