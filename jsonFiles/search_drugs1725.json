The tests were conducted privately, as part of a series of new drug-control procedures adopted by the U.S.O.C. in the aftermath of drug-related controversies at last summer's Pan American Games. The results will remain confidential between the athletes and Dr. Harmon Brown, the physician. The athletes will be allowed to take other such non-punitive tests between now and next June's United States Olympic trials. ''It's an opportunity to educate athletes about drug testing and eliminate the fear factor,'' said Dr. Brown, the director of the student health center at California State University-Hayward and one of nine physicians from various parts of the country who were named to serve on the U.S.O.C. task force. ''There's so much misinformation about drugs and their effect. The attitude we're taking with athletes on this is that maybe you've been involved in past practices and taking something, here's an opportunity to be counseled and clean up your act before the trials.''", "headline": {"main": "DRUG CONTROL BRINGS CONTROVERSY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 2025, "_id": "4fd130018eb7c8105d5fccb9", "snippet": "LAST month, a small group of prominent American track and field athletes volunteered to submit to drug-control tests by a physician attached to the United States Olympic Committee's Task Force on Drug Control.
