They suffer from dry mouth, a symptom often dismissed as an annoyance they have to learn to live with. Dry mouth is not just annoying. It can be extremely debilitating, interfering with the ability to taste food and swallow it, to talk and to maintain the health of the teeth and of oral tissues. It can also be a symptom of an underlying disorder of the immune system, Sjogren's syndrome, which affects fluid-secreting glands throughout the body.", "headline": {"main": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "11", "word_count": 1067, "_id": "4fd145c48eb7c8105d620373", "snippet": "IT is common experience, when    reading or hearing about an   especially wonderful meal, to   salivate at the thought of eating it.

''It was primarily mothers who took care of babies for millennia, and this is no longer the case,'' said Dr. Edward Zigler, Sterling Professor of Psychology at Yale University. ''We don't know what it's doing to family bonds or to the future shape of society - because as families go, so goes society,'' Social scientists note a shift in the use made of their research, which no longer fuels a controversy over whether day care is advisable. ''You can't debate whether children should be in some form of day care or other - that's nonsense,'' said Dr. Sheila B. Kamerman, professor of social policy and planning at Columbia University.

Laws governing child care vary widely from state to state, and many officials say they have neither the manpower not the money to enforce even the limited standards now in effect. Many of those officials and other experts on the subject are critical of Reagan Administration policies that since 1981 have reduced Federal subsidies for day-care services to low income families and have cut grants formerly used to help pay for the regulation of other child care programs. Some social workers and officials contend that the Ffederal Government should intervene, setting uniform national standards for child care. The Reagan Administration argues that such stndards are not necessary and that cuts in financing, part of a broad campaign to hold down Government spending have not denied essential services to truly needy Americans.", "headline": {"main": "INCREASED DEMAND FOR DAY CARE PROMPTS A DEBATE ON REGULATION"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 3502, "_id": "4fd141398eb7c8105d6191d8", "snippet": "The explosive growth in the demand for child care and widely publicized reports of the sexual abuse of children at daycare centers in New York and California are raising questions about the quality of such care and the need for increased regulation. ...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/02/us/increased-demand-for-day-care-prompts-a-debate-on-regulation.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Robert", "lastname": "LINDSEY"}], "original": "By ROBERT LINDSEY"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1984-09-02T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "U.S."}], "meta": {"hits": 3, "offset": 0, "time": 49}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
