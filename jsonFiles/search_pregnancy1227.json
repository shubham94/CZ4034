Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show. Museums ''MARLENE DUMAS: NAME NO NAMES,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through June 2). A white South African artist now living in Amsterdam, Ms. Dumas touches visually on many issues important to the modern psyche: gender, identity, power, politics, love, sex, babies, machismo and racial inequality. She translates her ideas into raw drawings with such ease and fluency that her art seems to say conversationally, ''Hey, this is how it is.'' But ingratiating it isn't. Unabashedly swiping images from high art, fashion, the news media, comic strips and what-all, she creates her own flawed but very human world, where prostitutes ply their trade without compunction, men display their genitals, the strains of pregnancy are visible, babies look birth-ugly and rows of multiracial portraits serve to remind that the global majority is not white. Her quirky but eloquent draftsmanship and no-shame willingness to deal with raw human material make this show an exhilarating experience. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students, artists and 65+ (Grace Glueck). * ''ORAZIO AND ARTEMISIA GENTILESCHI: FATHER AND DAUGHTER PAINTERS IN BAROQUE ITALY,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through May 12). Orazio took Caravaggio's art out of the cellar and into the sun. Artemisia's work has a visceral charge her father's doesn't. Besides getting the predictable crowds attracted by her fame, the show ought to cause visitors to look patiently at Orazio's paintings, which should come as a revelation to many people. He is one of those curious cases of a coarse man capable of making the sweetest art, as if a hard outer shell were protection for a soft heart. Artemisia, the celebrity, was a great artist, too, when she was good. The exhibition is basically a connoisseur's exercise, treating both him and her respectfully as artists of variable talents who would have wanted to be remembered for what they painted, not as symbols or victims or fodder for modern novelists, cultural theorists and pop psychologists. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman). ''IN THE FLOW: ARTISTS FROM THE LIVING MUSEUM,'' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700 (through July 7). The first formal museum exhibition of work by 20 artists from the Living Museum, a 19-year-old innovative art program at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens Village, runs the stylistic gamut from classic folk art to work that would look at home in a Chelsea gallery. The high point is an installation by an artist named John Tursi, whose 20-foot-tall painted scrolls unleash a universe of colorful semi-abstract beings whose naughty activities are far outweighed by their decorative force. The end result of the show, in addition to quite a bit of viewing pleasure, is to once more render the insider art-outsider art distinction moot (Roberta Smith). ''JEWISH LIFE IN ANCIENT EGYPT: A FAMILY ARCHIVE FROM THE NILE VALLEY,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through May 12). Although the Jews, led by Moses, fled centuries of bondage in Egypt around 1250 B.C., they were back in the country, by then Persian-ruled, as free citizens 800 years later. So say the biblical books of II Kings and Jeremiah, and their assertions are confirmed by the 1893 discovery of a papyrus collection on Elephantine Island in the Nile. Among scrolls from that collection given to the museum 50 years ago, and now displayed in this small show, are several relating to the family of Ananiah, a priest at a temple on the island. The scrolls are legal documents about Ananiah's marriage to an Egyptian slave girl, the couple's purchase of a house, her freedom from bondage by her master and more minor transactions. The museum has raised the visual quotient by adding works from its own collection, like a striking granite statue (680-650 B.C.) of an Egyptian worshiper. But the soul of the show is the story told by the not very visual papyri. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3, students and 62+ (Glueck). * ''OSKAR KOKOSCHKA: EARLY PORTRAITS FROM VIENNA AND BERLIN, 1909-1914,'' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 (through June 10). The ''schlag de la schlag'' of European culture, as well as its decadence, posed for the Austrian Expressionist Kokoschka (1886-1980) during his five-year concentration on portraits at an early stage of his life. The architect Adolf Loos, the composer Anton von Webern, the famous husband collector Alma Mahler (with whom Kokoschka had a passionate affair), as well as Kokoschka himself, are included in this dazzling array of faces and their expressive extension, hands. Several of the show's most gripping visages are of patients in a Swiss tuberculosis sanitarium, among them Victoire de Montesquiou-Fezensac, whose pale, brooding face and long emaciated torso speak eloquently of the illness she tried to conceal by dressing herself to the nines. The portrait, one of his penetrating best, was later included in the notorious ''Degenerate Art'' exhibition staged by the Nazis in 1937. Kokoschka went on to a long career of painting, writing and humanitarian causes, but these insightful portraits are possibly his greatest achievements. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 65+ (Glueck) * ''THE NEW WAY OF TEA,'' Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, and Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 327-9276 (through May 19). Ever since powdered tea was introduced in Japan 800 years ago by Zen monks studying in China, the Japanese have been fine-tuning the complex culture known as the way of tea, called the tea ceremony in the West. Much deeper than a social rite, the tea culture involves elements from Zen Buddhism and the classic Shinto religion, as well as Japanese appreciation of the seasonal phenomena of nature. This show takes a look at the tea ceremony going back to the 16th century, when it began to develop a Japanese identity over its Chinese origins. But the focus is on contemporary teahouses and utensils by Japanese designers and those from East Asia and the West, with seven teahouses and their furnishings set up in the two institutions. They are accompanied by paintings and 100 examples of bowls, kettles, tea and incense containers, scoops, water jars, chopsticks and other implements. The display proves proves that although the way of tea has evolved as a spiritual and philosophical experience, it provides delight in objects of earthly, sensual appeal. Asia Society hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+. Japan Society hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and 65+ (Glueck). * ''GERHARD RICHTER: 40 YEARS OF PAINTING,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through May 21). One of the finest, most beautiful and strangely moving exhibitions of the work of a living painter in years. You could quibble about one picture or another, but it is just about pitch perfect as an overview of this 70-year-old German master's maddeningly kaleidoscopic and exquisitely refined output. Since the mid-1960's, Mr. Richter has undoubtedly been Europe's most challenging painter, an evasive switch-hitter between realism and abstraction. You need to see the work, like all good art, firsthand to grasp properly its dizzying diversity, spooky presence and tactile allure. Mr. Richter maintains a kind of cruel faith. The world is mean and absurd. Nature is sublime but indifferent to us. Mass culture turns thinking people into sheep. But beauty is still out there. We can see it only if we don't lie to ourselves. It's what is left after you strip away the clich\u00e9s and false rhetoric. ''I constantly despair at my own incapacity, at the impossibility of ever accomplishing anything, of painting a valid, true picture or of even knowing what such a thing ought to look like,'' he once wrote. ''But then I always have the hope that, if I persevere, it might one day happen.'' Clearly it does happen in the show, again and again. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and 65+ (Kimmelman). * ''THE RUSSIAN AVANT-GARDE BOOK, 1910-34,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through May 21). In its final offering before going dark on West 53rd Street for a three-year expansion, the Modern has come up with a very MOMA show. Immaculately installed, it's a classic combination of visual \u00e9lan and radical ideas. The 300 books on display were designed and in many cases collaboratively made -- printed, collaged, painted, annotated, bound -- by some of Russia's greatest modern artists and poets. The early examples are playfully anarchic; after the 1917 revolution they become graphically more logical and symmetrical, and photographic. The best of them are as vibrant as any painting and, with their hand-sewn bindings, wrap-around designs and textured covers, have the material presence of sculpture. Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter). * ''THE SHORT CENTURY: INDEPENDENCE AND LIBERATION MOVEMENTS IN AFRICA, 1945-1994,'' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through May 5). This landmark assemblage of art and artifact -- including photojournalism, film and music -- aims to tell the tumultuous, cruel yet culturally rich history of postcolonial Africa. The course painting and popular culture, the interrelationship of the political and the visual, the clash of the modern and the tribal, and the roles of important leaders and writers are among its many themes. For example, one can trace the charismatic, Patrice Lumumba (the doomed leader present at birth of Congo in 1960) from documentary film to folk painting to video memoir, watching the ripple effect of his legacy. Brilliant advantage is taken of P.S. 1's vast, multidirectional structure, and against all odds, the show largely and unforgettably succeeds, in the process breathing new life into the large-scale context-oriented exhibition form. A good point of entry into its complexities is Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne's ''Borom Sarret,'' a fablelike 1963 film classic that seems to encapsulate past, present and future within its crystalline form (Smith). * ''SURREALISM: DESIRE UNBOUND,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through May 12). Destined to be popular, this show is not your ladies-who-lunch Met exhibition, particularly because of a small amount of pornography, although only bluenoses and people who have never looked closely at what's on view every day in the permanent collection of the museum will find the presence of erotic Surreal art truly daring or sensational. Organized and first presented by the Tate Modern in London last year, the event has ''desire'' as its unnecessary motif, as if it were not previously self-evident that sex was always at the heart of the Surrealist program. There are plenty of chestnuts to please the masses, like Magritte's painting of hooded lovers kissing, an illustration that love is blind, and Dal\u00ed's lobster telephone, although what the telephone has to do with desire is not clear. A few works still raise eyebrows, and some of the old jokes are still funny. But success neutered the movement decades ago. The Surrealists, having opened everybody's eyes to the essential weirdness of everyday life, fostered the demand for ever greater anomalies, relegating their own work to the quaint status of bowler hats and antique sewing machines. Now much of it looks small and slightly embarrassing. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman). * ''2002 BIENNIAL EXHIBITION,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street (212) 570-3676, and in Central Park (through May 26). The Biennial, the show that almost always gets the art world's knickers in a twist, is looking good this time around. One whole floor (the top one) works totally as an integrated installation, and there are strong sections on the two other floors. If photography and painting are in shortish supply, there's lots of sound and digital art, an excellent film program, an off-site sculpture show in Central Park and all sorts of oddball, handmade stuff on the walls and floors -- stained glass, quilts, lacework, architectural models -- making this an unusually labor-intensive show. The main thing this Biennial has going for it, though, is a thematic point of view that has to do, in ways hilarious and sad, with American culture and spiritual history, from the Transcendentalist 19th century to the psychedelic 60's to the standing-here-wondering now. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8, students and 62+ (Cotter). Galleries: Uptown * ''ENDURING ART OF JADE AGE CHINA: CHINESE JADE OF LATE NEOLITHIC THROUGH HAN PERIODS, VOLUME II,'' Throckmorton Fine Art, 153 East 61st Street, (212) 223-1059 (through April 27). Jade was invested with moral weight and spiritual power in ancient China. Its touch ensured immortality, and because it was extremely difficult to work, anything made from it carried the glamour of rarity. That aura lingers around the small, intricate pieces here, from a statuette of a nude woman (circa 1500 B.C.) to a zany little figure with a human torso emerging from the body of a snake. The curator, Elizabeth Childs-Johnson, has suggested that jade was perceived as a vehicle of metamorphosis and transformation: just as the man leaves the serpent behind, so human life leaves earth for eternity. The show beautifully illustrates such metaphors (Cotter). ''EROTICA AND THE LIKE,'' CDS Gallery, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555 (through April 27). The rather loose title covers a wildly assorted gathering of works (mostly small) by a starry cast of artists from Goya to Picasso to Lucian Freud. Some are more erotic than others: three roisterous Picasso etchings from his well-known ''347'' series of sexual fantasias; a couple of de Kooning drawings of nudes from the 1940's that exude a savage sexuality; an undated drawing by the Surrealist Hans Bellmer of a head with multiple appurtenances. A more tender meditation on lovemaking is occasioned by Jim Peters's tiny wax nude couple. Bonnard, Louise Bourgeois, Robert Graham, Tom Wesselmann, Balthus and Vuillard are among others represented (Glueck). Galleries: 57th Street GRAHAM GILLMORE, Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929 (through April 27). Mr. Gillmore incises funny, often self-deprecating texts into super-glossy abstract paintings. In one we read, ''Although there are no cures for this painting, there are treatments and there is hope'' (Ken Johnson). JACK TWORKOV: ''RED, WHITE AND BLUE,'' Ameringer/Howard/Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 935-1110, and Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, (through April 13). Although the American flag won its best-known homage in mid-20th-century art from Jasper Johns, it crept into the work of other artists as well, among them Jack Tworkov (1900-1982), whose Abstract Expressionist painting was distinguished by its vigorous brushing and vibrant color. As it was for Johns, for Tworkov the flag was there, and its rigid format offered opportunities for all manner of exploration. In short, precisely because of its esteem as a symbol, its form could be played with and reordered. One example here is ''Oh Columbia'' (1962), a big, loose rendering of the Stars and Stripes in red, white and blue, notable for its relaxed paint handling, insertion of verticals to arrest the horizontal flow and its bleary, blurred appearance, as if perceived by a drunk. As a demonstration not of flag-waving but of how a symbol can impinge on an artist's consciousness, this makes an engrossing two-gallery show (Glueck). Galleries: Chelsea PETER COFFIN, ''Perfect if On,'' Andrew Kreps, 516 West 20th Street, (212) 741-8849 (through April 20). A greenhouse in which various live musicians play for the plants; hazy pastel-colored photographic prints said to be actual recordings of people's spiritual auras; and diagrammatic red line-drawing on the wall that is supposed to represent telepathic communication: is Mr. Coffin spoofing New Age mythologies, or is he a real believer? It's hard to tell. (Johnson) JACK FEATHERLY, Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212) 279-9219 (through April 15). Mr. Featherly's snappy abstract paintings are smart and likable. Crisp, meandering lines or circles moving over, around and through brushy, blotchy patches of saturated, glossy color create an engaging spatial counterpoint while playfully questioning the great 20th-century romance of abstract painting (Johnson). ROBERT HAWKINS, Gracie Mansion, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 505-9577 (through April 13). Mr. Hawkins is a funny, eccentric image-maker and a good-enough painter. On square, easel-size canvases, he depicts a kangaroo with a koala bear in her pouch; Pilgrims and Indians sitting down to a gargantuan roast turkey; Neanderthal men ambushing a deer in the forest; and, in an image that approaches moral profundity, a golden crown placed as bait in a bear trap (Johnson). NICKY HOBERMAN, Feigen Contemporary, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 929-0500 (through April 13). Small and prepubescent children not seen at their psychological best are the subjects of this London-based painter. Worked up from Polaroids, their oddly distorted bodies float in mostly empty space as -- alone or with others -- they keep their distance, with expressions and body language that can't be described as welcoming. The works could be read as symbols of the present-day societal anomie that extends even to childhood, but they are more than just symbols. Many of us would recognize these woe-burdened children on home ground (Glueck). * ELIZABETH MURRAY, PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000 (through April 27). Small, cut-and-folded watercolors replay Ms. Murray's familiar tales of domestic craziness starring animated coffee cups and splay-legged tables. They don't have the funky muscularity of her big paintings, but the intimate scale, lucid color and not-too-fussy craft make for a pleasing change of pace (Johnson). JOVI SCHNELL, ''Galactic Pulses,'' Derek Eller, 526-30 West 26th Street, (212) 206-6411 (through April 13). If Jim Nutt, Trevor Winkfield and Dr. Seuss decided to collaborate, they might produce paintings something like Ms. Schnell's. Though not quite as weirdly individualized as anything by those artists, her trippy, crisply outlined agglomerations of cellular, mechanical, architectural, botanical and sexual forms are well designed and have an appealingly bouncy comic spirit (Johnson). Galleries: SoHo * ELLEN GALLAGHER, ''Preserve,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through April 18). This exhibition features a painter's first major work in three dimensions plus a series of collages -- altered pages of advertisements for wigs from old issues of magazines like Ebony and Black Stars. The collages suffer from a heavy-handed obviousness, but the sculpture, an expansive construction of white wooden dowels like a children's jungle gym, almost imperceptibly decorated with abstracted elements of racist caricature, works both formally and metaphorically (Johnson). * HANNO OTTEN, ''Color Block Series,'' Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 431-0166 (through April 20). Projecting colored light directly onto photographic paper, Mr. Otten produces smart, gorgeous, completely abstract photograms. The technique evokes a history of avant-garde photography dating back to Man Ray and Laszlo Moholy-Nage; the overlapping, slightly off-kilter squares, rectangles and bands of luminous, translucent color call to mind any number of Modernist grid painters. But the unabashed hedonism is utterly contemporary (Johnson). ''REACTIONS,'' Exit Art, 548 Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 966-7745 (through April 20). A few months ago the gallery sent out about 10,000 letters inviting responses to the events of Sept. 11. More than 2,500 pieces arrived, and they're all on view here, edge to edge in alphabetical order by artist. The work ranges from scrawled words to children's drawings to sophisticated graphics with contributions by some art world stars rubbing shoulders with anonymous submissions. Especially interesting is the attitudinal mix, which includes a current of dissident, anti-establishment political anger. In the second gallery is original artwork for Sept. 11 publications by DC Comics and the truly alternative World War Threellustrated (Cotter). ED RUSCHA, ''Country Cityscapes,'' Susan Inglett, 100 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0573 (through April 20). Though minor, this presentation of new prints affirms Mr. Ruscha's unrivaled connection to the sacred-and-profane spirit of America. Richly colored photogravure pictures of wild Western landscapes are interrupted by blanks reserved for movie tough-talk printed in the margin below (''You will eat hot lead.'') A large lithograph has white letters against a dark, cloudy sky, divinely announcing, ''Safe And Effective Medication'' (Johnson). ''THREE PAINTERS,'' Margarete Roeder, 545 Broadway, between Prince and Spring Streets, (212) 925-6098 (through April 27). The three participating in this elegant show are abstractionists who want nothing to interfere with the sensuous experience of pure painting. Rudolf de Crignis makes deep blue squares with perfectly satiny surfaces; Peter Tollens paints monochromatic fields that have a dry, slightly crusty texture; and Michael Toenges builds his pictures out of big, thick and greasy brushstrokes (Johnson). SUSAN WEIL, ''Moving Pictures,'' Tagore, 137 Greene Street, (212) 677-4520 (through April 21). The earliest piece in this show is a full-body profile of the artist on blueprint paper, a collaboration from 1950 between Ms. Weil and her then-husband, Robert Rauschenberg. For the most interesting of her recent work, the artist cuts up large, Matissean paintings on paper into paperback-size rectangles, scrambles the pieces and pins them to the wall in grids to polyrhythmic visual effect (Johnson). Other Galleries * ''THIN SKIN: THE FICKLE NATURE OF BUBBLES, SPHERES AND INFLATABLE STRUCTURES,'' AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-4818 (through April 13). Designed to explain why so many artists these days are working with balloons, bubbles, diaphanous or transparent surfaces and similar forms and materials, this entertaining 22-artist exhibition includes Andy Warhol's floating Mylar pillows, Ernesto Neto's sensuous environment of stuffed Lycra, an installation by Olafur Eliasson where water drops disturb the surface of a shallow pool, and a photograph of Tom Friedman with a bubble of saliva frozen in his open mouth (Johnson). * TIM HAWKINSON, ''\u00dcberorgan,'' Ace Gallery, 275 Hudson Street, at Dominic Street, South Village, (212) 255-5599 (through May 15). The art world's master tinkerer and garage genius has cobbled together an enormous, slightly insane conflation of human body and musical instrument, seemingly from scraps. This Goldbergian contraption funnels air into room-size white plastic balloons, which resemble bladders or lungs and function as primitive bagpipes. The piece meanders in and out of six big spaces in this Super Bowl-size gallery, and gives one the feeling of visiting a zoo of mournful whales or walking through the belly of some inchoate beast. But its most haunting effect may be purely aural (Smith). Last Chance GEORG BASELITZ, Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623 (through tomorrow). This small show of works from the 1990's by the German Neo-Expressionist features two big, primitivistic sculptures -- a head and an armless, legless female figure -- incongruously covered in patches of plaid fabric. They have a certain imposingly brutal yet oddly folksy presence. On the walls hang smallish, roughly poetic watercolors in which sketchy figures appear upside down (Johnson). * ''CHINESE PORCELAIN AND SILVER IN THE SONG DYNASTY,'' J. J. Lally & Co. 41 E. 57th St., (212) 371-3380 (Through Monday). This ethereal show mixes media in revelatory ways. Silver objects, often produced for high-end domestic use, served as models for Song-period porcelains, and marvelous examples of both are here for instructive comparison. Other visual delights include a range of porcelains with off-white glazes that seem to change before your eyes, like the colors of a mood ring (Cotter). * BRYAN CROCKETT, ''Cultured,'' Lehmann Maupin, 39 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 965-0753 (through tomorrow). This show, maybe the creepiest in town, features seven possum-size sculptures of hairless baby mice, seemingly carved from pink marble (but actually cast in faux-stone composite). Each mouse represents a scientifically updated version of a deadly sin: the snarling representative of anger is said to be pumped up on testosterone; an immensely fat glutton has been given an extra gene for obesity. Whatever the conceptual import, these bizarrely lifelike animals are wonderfully repulsive (Johnson). ALFRED EISENSTAEDT/AL HIRSCHFELD, Leica Gallery, 670 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 777-3051 (through tomorrow). Working for Life magazine, Eisenstaedt produced some of the most memorable journalistic photographs ever. Including the famous kiss on V-J Day, Sophia Loren in a semitransparent negligee and John F. Kennedy at his desk with young Caroline in a swimsuit, this exhibition reminds us how deeply photography saturates modern consciousness. Mr. Hirschfeld, the great cartoon chronicler of New York theater, is almost 99. This small celebratory show of photographs includes two new prints by the artist; photographic portraits by his wife, Louise Kerz; and many family snapshots (Johnson). * ''MODERNISM AND ABSTRACTION,'' National Academy of Design Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Sunday). In recent years the Smithsonian in Washington has accumulated an impressive, if small, collection of 20th-century American works, strongest in Modernism and Abstract Expressionism but with a few choice examples from earlier and later periods. The more than 50 paintings and sculptures here make up a show that has more breadth than depth, with no claim to comprehensiveness. But there are fine works by Stuart Davis, Arthur Dove, Georgia O'Keeffe, Robert Motherwell, Ellsworth Kelly, Ilya Bolotowsky, Jan Matulka, Carl Holty, Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg and others. The show provides an illuminating glimpse of what went on in American art across a 75-year period with a few surprises and discoveries. The pervasive feeling of the installation is of blazing light and color, from Dove's ''Sun'' (1943), a rhythmical composition in yellows, greens and blues, to Hockney's big, superchromatic highway abstraction ''Double Entrance'' (1993-95). Viewed as a serendipitous windfall, the show repays a visit.
