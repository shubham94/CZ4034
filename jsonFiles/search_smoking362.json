It has been a rough eight months for Verdant Power, the company that owns the equipment. Days after the first two turbines were lowered into the water, the East River's powerful currents sheared off the tips of several blades. New blades -- made of a cast aluminum that theoretically would hold up better -- replaced the ones that were broken and were also installed on the four other turbines.Together, the turbines are capable of producing about 1,000 kilowatt hours a day of clean electricity.But the East River tides have proved too formidable even for the stronger blades, putting excessive strain on the bolts that hold them to the turbine hubs, so all six turbines have been shut for repairs. A and a video accompany Mr. DePalma's article; an earlier video, in January, examined how the turbines work.", "snippet": "A roundup of the morning news."}], "meta": {"offset": 0, "hits": 1, "time": 22}}}
