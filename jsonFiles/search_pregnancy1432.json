Four centuries later, the Catholic Church determined that the Virgin Mary had conceived her son through her ear and decreed therefore that this organ be covered in public. Sex is a function of its time. Throughout these thousand years, views on woman's sexuality have reflected the ebb and flow of morality, science and religious thought. Some of the following observations will seem remarkably advanced, some familiar, some bizarre. But when it was proclaimed, each rang with the confidence of truth. A woman experiences ''three delights in intercourse: one from the motion of her own sperm, a second from the motion of the male sperm and a third from the motion or rubbing that takes place in coitus.'' -- From ''The Canon of Medical Knowledge,'' a compendium by Avicenna, the Arab physician and philosopher, circa 1030 (translated into Latin in the 12th century) ''Woman is defective and misbegotten, for the active force in the male seed tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex; while the production of woman comes from a defect in the active force. . .or influence.'' -- St. Thomas Aquinas, 13th century ''If the suffocation [of the uterus] comes from a retention of her sperm, the woman should get together with and draw up a marriage contract with some man. If she does not or cannot do this, because she is a nun. . .or because she is married to an old man incapable of giving her her due, she should travel overseas.. . .'' -- John of Gaddesden, of the faculty of medicine at Oxford University, 14th century ''In order to enter, the man must give many caresses. . .and consider the readiness of his wife; then, he must move in and out, in this way he will succeed. Then he must attempt to release all his sperm in one burst, not in dribbles, nor must he raise or lower himself, as is commonly done for pleasure, but instead remain fixed in the hole so that the air cannot enter and corrupt the seed.'' -- From the Italian physician Michele Savonorola's guide to pregnancy, 15th century 'Ohime! The devil knows how to do so much between husband and wife. He makes them touch and kiss not only the honest parts but the dishonest ones as well. Even just to think about it, I am overwhelmed by horror, fright and bewilderment.. . . You call this holy matrimony?' -- From ''Rules of Married Life,'' by Brother Cherubino da Siena, 15th century ''Let's not even mention wives who constantly ask for payments on the conjugal debt.. . .We're talking about women who want to grind night and day, all the time, who in the end unwittingly lead us to acquire the virtue of temperance.'' -- From Grappa, the nom de plume of an Italian writer, lampooning the tyranny of conjugal debt, 1545 'Womb-Furie is a sort of madness, arising from a vehement and unbridled desire of Carnal Inbracement, which desire disthrones the Rational Faculty so far, that the Patient utters wanton and lascivious Speeches.' -- Lazar Riverius, a French authority on anatomy and medicine, describing what came to be known in later centuries as hysteria, 17th century ''The clitoris is a sinewy and hard body.. . .This is that which causeth lust in women, and gives delight in copulation, for without this a woman neither desires copulation or hath pleasure in it, or conceives by it.'' -- From ''A Directory for Midwives, or a Guide for Women in Their Conception, Bearing and Suckling Their Children,'' by Nicolas Culpeper, an English herbalist and medical authority on rearing children, 1651 ''Many women die without having experienced the extreme of pleasure.. . .The motive force which in them calls out for pleasure is so delicate and the source of it so distant, that we need not be surprised if pleasure does not come at all or gets lost upon the way.'' -- From ''On Women,'' an essay by the French encylopedist Denis Diderot, 1772 ''Assistant magnetisers, generally strong, handsome young men, embraced the patients between the knees. . .until off they went, one after the other, in convulsive fits.'' -- A description of a ''mesmeric session'' for the treatment of hysteria, named for the German physician Friedrich Anton Mesmer, 1841 ''I should say that the majority of women (happily for them) are not very much troubled with sexual feeling of any kind. What men are habitually, women are only exceptionally.'' -- From ''The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs in Childhood, Youth, Adult Age and Advanced Life,'' by the British physician William Acton, 1857 'No human hand is capable of communicating to the tissues such rapid, steady and prolonged vibrations, and certain kneading and percussion movements, as the vibrator.' -- From ''Principles of Electro-medicine, Electro-surgery and Radiology,'' by Anthony Matijaca, who prescribed vibratory sessions to relieve ''female troubles,'' 1917 ''Every considerable erotic stimulation of their wives that does not terminate in orgasm, on the woman's part, represents an injury, and repeated injuries of this kind lead to permanent -- or very obstinate -- damage to both body and soul.'' -- From ''Ideal Marriage,'' a popular marriage manual by the Dutch physician Theodoor H. van de Velde, 1926 ''We have long understood that the development of female sexuality is complicated by the fact that the girl has a task of giving up what was originally her leading genital zone, the clitoris, in favor of a new genital zone, the vagina.'' -- From ''Female Sexuality,'' by Sigmund Freud, 1931 ''Some of the psychoanalysts and some other clinicians insist that only vaginal stimulation and a 'vaginal orgasm' can provide a psychologically satisfactory culmination to the activity of a 'sexually mature' female. It is difficult, however, in the light of our present understanding of the anatomy and physiology of sexual response, to understand what can be meant by a 'vaginal orgasm.' '' -- From ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female,'' by Alfred C. Kinsey et al., 1953 ''The corded neck muscles, the swollen, flushed face and the expanded rib cage are familiar aspects of total female response to sexual tension.'' -- From ''Orgasm, Anatomy of the Female,'' by William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson, 1961 ''The defense experts testified that they see the film [''Deep Throat''] legitimizing woman's need and 'life right' for sexual gratification, equal with that of men. They also see in the film the thoughtful lesson that sex should. . .take varied forms with complete sexual gratification as the crowning goal.. . . These unusual and startling revelations are of social value, they say, not only for the bedroom, but necessary as an object lesson for a public forum.' -- From the decision of Judge Joel J. Tyler in People v. Mature Enterprises Inc.; Tyler ruled that the exhibitors of ''Deep Throat'' were promoting obscene material and were therefore criminally liable to pay a fine, 1973 'Men make their own orgasms during sex; women should be able to as well.' -- Shere Hite, author of ''The Hite Report on Female Sexuality,'' 1976 ''Sex is at the core of fertility, yet it is often treated as a taboo subject when couples have sub-fertility problems. More discussion of women's perceptions of orgasm and how orgasms can be achieved could be helpful.'' -- Dr. Laura Quinton, in-vitro-fertilization research fellow at Hammersmith Hospital, London, commenting on the results of a study that suggested that not coming to climax during sex may reduce some women's chance of conceiving, 1995 ''For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in 'sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.'' -- From the definition of sexual relations that United States District Judge Susan Webber Wright allowed in the deposition of President Clinton in the Paula Corbin Jones lawsuit, 1998", "headline": {"main": "The Truth About Sex -- at Any Given Moment"}, "abstract": "Article by Camille Sweeney notes views on woman's sexuality have reflected ebb and flow of morality, science and religious thought for last thousand years; quotes observations on the subject by noted people and in noted publications, dating from 11th-century medical text to 1998 court decision in Paula Jones lawsuit against Pres Clinton; photo (M)", "print_page": "114", "word_count": 1365, "_id": "4fd225448eb7c8105d7ac7a3", "snippet": "In 1068, a group of Norman women demanded that William the Conqueror release their husbands from military service so that they could return home and satisfy their wives' sexual needs.
