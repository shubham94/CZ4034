JOANN E. MANSON exercises 20 or 30 minutes every morning on a treadmill or a rowing machine and takes a 10-minute walk every afternoon. She lifts weights for 15 minutes three times a week. Like her fellow investigators on the Harvard Nurses' Health Study -- a 25-year project that has produced a trove of medical findings -- she has become a believer in the preventive power of exercise. But for Dr. Manson, a 48-year-old professor at Harvard Medical School, the great delight in the study's findings about heart disease was the realization that ''no pain, no gain'' is a myth -- that even moderate exercise makes a big difference. The Nurses' Health Study began in 1976, when more than 120,000 nurses filled out questionnaires about their habits and their health. The survey has continued with questionnaires every other year, generating a vast array of information about heart disease, cancer and the effects of lifestyle choices like exercise, diet, alcohol and smoking.", "snippet": "DR.

Nothing in particular set off the attack, he recalls; what stands out was that anger had become his reflexive response to stress. By his own account, he would morph into a yeller, a fist-clencher, a vein-popper.
