His tattoos -- the sun and a cross on his forearms and unintelligible markings on his knuckles, a result of a drunken evening -- lent Jerry an air of defiance. The Juvenile Court magistrate, Joseph Coyte, asked if he had anything to say. Jerry, who had dropped out of school, had been on probation for stealing a car when he cut off his ankle monitor and fled for San Diego to live with his sister. There, he smoked marijuana and hung out until deciding he'd had enough of being on the run. He then turned himself in. The prosecutor asked that the judge send him to a youth prison. Jerry rose; his hands, manacled and shaking, clutched a penciled four-page letter he had written. He read it aloud.

The favorite amendment of gangsters is the fifth (no self-incrimination), of liberals the first (free speech), of drug dealers the fourth (no unauthorized search), of gun fondlers the second (to bear arms). Now, many people have a new favorite, the long-neglected 10th (powers not specifically assigned to Washington are reserved to the states). As recently as 1985, when the Supreme Court reversed one of its rare decisions based on the amendment (Garcia canceling Usery), the 10th was being called a dead letter. Certainly few people tried to ''take the 10th'' the way gangsters and fellow travelers ''took the fifth.'' But now the amendment has many takers. The Supreme Court used it in 1992, 1995 and 1997 and shows an eagerness to extend that run. Bob Dole, in his last year in the Senate, began carrying the words of the amendment around with him for instant recitation. Newt Gingrich's insurgents relied on it in 1994 to preach devolution of power from the Federal to the state level. Even President Clinton gives states the title Louis Brandeis thought up for them, ''laboratories of democracy.'' Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin thinks it is high time for the amendment to be resurrected.
