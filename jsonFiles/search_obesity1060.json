Will sex become completely recreational, with the serious business of reproduction going on in carefully monitored tubes? Will the main form of medical treatment consist of gene therapy, designed to replace defective DNA at the squeeze of a syringe? Probably not. Doubtless in the decades to come gene therapy will become more exact, but unless numerous difficult problems are solved, the possibility of precisely engineering people who carry mutant genes into people who are genetically normal is minute. Yet our understanding of the genetics of human disease does promise to transform medical practice. One hundred years from now, we shall know the molecular structures of virtually all human genes, the functions of a significant percentage of them and the molecular mechanisms at work in a large number of human afflictions. Fantasies aside, the chief novelty of late-21st-century medicine will lie in its powerful ability to predict and prevent.", "snippet": "The pace and extent of the genetic revolution makes it tempting to speculate about life at the end of the 21st century.
