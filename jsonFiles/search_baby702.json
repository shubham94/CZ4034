The members agreed to develop a plan to radically revamp Medicare by giving its beneficiaries a fixed sum of money to buy private or public insurance. In short, the use of vouchers -- something liberals have shunned in education -- might be good for Medicare. Bruce C. Vladeck, a former administrator of Medicare, who is a staunch defender of the basic fee-for-service plan, began the debate by proposing that Medicare officials get stronger powers to restrict some medical practices, to negotiate fees and to favor participation by some physicians over others. A dissenting member, Stuart H. Altman, a Brandeis University professor, argued that Mr. Vladeck's proposals might result in excessive Governmental control.
