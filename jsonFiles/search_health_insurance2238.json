[C1.] A FUTURE IN GOING SMALL -- SAP, the biggest maker of business management software, said that it would invest as much as $520 million over two years on an organization aimed at smaller business clients. SAP's chief executive, Henning Kagermann, left, said SAP was accelerating efforts begun a few years ago to cater to smaller businesses. [C5.] FORGOTTEN ENERGY LAB -- The 30-year-old National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, is more frayed than high-tech.

[F1.] EX-BOOZ HAMILTON LEADER DIES -- James B. Farley, an executive who moved seamlessly between the worlds of management consulting and corporate America, died on Saturday.
