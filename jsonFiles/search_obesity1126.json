CONE, a molecular biologist at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, has a dog named Koda, a big, grizzled, lumbering tail-thumper who is part German shepherd, part collie. Lots of people own dogs that look like Koda, but not many are likely to know the molecular nuances of why their pets bear the coat colors they do. And it is because his dog so perfectly embodies basic principles of mammalian pigmentation that Dr. Cone has brought the animal into the laboratory to serve as exhibit A. \"Koda has classic agouti fur,\" says Dr. Cone, pushing apart a patch of the creature's thick pelt so the individual hairs can be seen in detail. \"Black at the base, a yellow stripe in the center and black at the tip -- that's the archetypal agouti.\" As though in proud concurrence, Koda thwacks her tail on the floor.", "snippet": "ROGER D.
