Although no reform can instantly improve quality and increase cost-efficiency in the enormous program, Mr. Clinton has delivered a well-considered proposal that can shore up Medicare without heedlessly expanding costs or creating chaos for 39 million beneficiaries. The plan takes a prudent, incremental approach in adding benefits and changing Medicare's structure. The proposal is premised on putting $794 billion into Medicare over the next 15 years from the projected $5.5 trillion Federal surplus. But any plan that does not greatly cut benefits or reduce eligibility through income tests or other means would need to put more money into Medicare in the next two decades as baby boomers reach retirement and technology makes it possible for more people to live longer. The Clinton plan would extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund to 2027.", "headline": {"main": "Improving Medicare"}, "abstract": "Editorial lauds Pres Clinton's Medicare reform plan; holds it takes prudent, incremental approach in adding benefits and changing Medicare's structure", "print_page": "22", "word_count": 493, "_id": "4fd221528eb7c8105d7a5c3f", "snippet": "President Clinton's Medicare reform plan, if approved by Congress, would constitute the most substantial change to Medicare since its creation in 1965.
