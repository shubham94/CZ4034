''I was ready to try something else that would help my moods,'' he said, ''and maybe help me lose some weight too.'' Mr. Hass, now 28, began working out with a personal trainer on Fridays, thanks to a program in Keene, N.H., called In Shape that pairs people with severe mental illnesses with mentors to guide them through a fitness regime. For almost a year and a half he also did circuit training and played tennis with his mentor. Since he signed up for In Shape not only has he lost 30 pounds, but he said his moods are steadier.", "snippet": "By improving mood, exercise can be a beneficial accompaniment to other kinds of treatment for mental illness."}], "meta": {"offset": 0, "hits": 2, "time": 33}}}
