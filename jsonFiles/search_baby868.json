School-age children who grew up drinking the water experienced a 65 percent reduction in dental caries, when compared with children in a neighboring city where the water was not fluoridated. The dental benefits of fluorides for adults as well as for children have been demonstrated over and over again amid a swirling dispute in which opponents have denounced this public health measure as a public health hazard. Some studies in laboratory animals that were fed up to 80 times the level of fluoride normally added to water have suggested an increase in bone cancer, and Danish mineral workers exposed to very high levels of fluoride were found to have a suspiciously high level of bladder cancers.", "headline": {"main": "Personal Health"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": 1074, "_id": "4fd1ce2b8eb7c8105d705ed2", "snippet": "FIFTY years ago, Grand Rapids, Mich., became the world's first city to fluoridate its water supply on purpose.
