In my six years doing this, I've had some people become very upset, because they were pretty certain about who infected them. They said they were going to attack the person. In one case, a client started screaming about how he was going to go kill his partner. But the people who react the most strongly are those who don't consider themselves to be in the ''high risk'' groups. When those people are positive, it's a lot to deal with. Until recently, there was a two-week wait before the results came in. But in the past few months, we have started using the new OraQuick test, which gives the patient a result in around 20 minutes. There are so many good things about the new test. We deal with a lot of the high-risk people who have unstable lives; there is a good chance they are not going to come back for their result. With OraQuick, we don't have to worry. On the other hand, we are right in the room with the client when we get the results. Sometimes, a result shows up in 5 or 10 minutes. You have no idea how stressful it is to know that someone is positive while you are sitting in front of him or her.

Judging from ''My Life Without Me,'' a new indie weepie that opens today in New York and Los Angeles, three decades of medical progress have failed to wipe out this terrible, mysterious malady. Sarah Polley, the pale, radiant young Canadian actress who has also starred in Atom Egoyan's ''Sweet Hereafter'' and ''Exotica'' and Hal Hartley's ''No Such Thing,'' grows simultaneously paler and more radiant as her character grows sicker. This bolsters two of the film's principal conceits, which might otherwise be a little shaky: that dying is a voyage of self-fulfillment, and that terminal illness can and should be kept secret until the last minute. Ms. Polley plays Ann, a 23-year-old mother of two who works on the night cleaning crew at the local university and lives with her husband, Don (Scott Speedman), in a trailer in her mother's back yard. The mother, played by the estimable Deborah Harry, is a study in working-class bitterness, and Ann's own biography, related in voice-over narration, has the ring of blue-collar boilerplate: teenage pregnancy, a father in jail, a husband who has trouble finding work. And then everything changes: at the hospital after a fainting spell, Ann learns that she has only a few months to live. Rather than tell her family, she decides to brave this terrible situation alone -- not just to make the best of her sickness, but to make it the best thing that ever happened to her.", "headline": {"main": "With Just a Few Months to Live, A Lifetime of Changes to Make", "kicker": "FILM REVIEW"}, "abstract": "A O Scott reviews movie My Life Without Me, directed by Isabel Coixet; Sarah Polley and Scott Speedman star; photo (M)", "print_page": "15", "word_count": 860, "_id": "4fd244e88eb7c8105d7df6b6", "snippet": "In the venerable Hollywood weepie ''Love Story'' -- or at least in the Mad magazine parody of it -- Ali McGraw suffered from a fatal disease that made her more beautiful as it progressed.
