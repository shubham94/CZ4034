The authors, Dr. JoAnn E. Manson of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School and colleagues from other leading medical centers in New England, reviewed nearly 200 major studies to evaluate the roles that known protective measures play. Their findings, which show that most heart attacks are avoidable, can help you focus your attention on the factor or factors that could most significantly increase your own chance of living a long and healthy life. Although annual coronary death rates have declined by about 30 percent since 1968, heart disease remains the nation's leading cause of death, claiming the lives of nearly 600,000 men and women a year. Nearly half these deaths occur before the heart attack victim reaches a hospital. And of the half million people who are admitted each year to hospitals after heart attacks, 15 percent die there and 7 to 10 percent succumb within a few years.", "snippet": "A VERY important but little noticed article on what Americans can do to prevent heart attacks was recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
