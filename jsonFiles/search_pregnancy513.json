The season will begin in August with Pam MacKinnon's production of ''Completeness,'' by Itamar Moses (''The Four of Us''), a comedy about a computer scientist who falls for a molecular biologist. Next will be ''Milk Like Sugar,'' a co-production with the Women's Project theater company about an inner-city teenager in a pregnancy pact, written by Kirsten Greenidge (''Bossa Nova'') and directed by Rebecca Taichman (''Orlando''). Ms. Gionfriddo's new play, ''Rapture, Blister, Burn,'' will follow, directed by Peter DuBois (''Becky Shaw''). According to a news release, the play is ''an unflinching look at gender politics in the wake of 20th-century feminist ideals,'' centering on two friends who pursued different careers and start dangerously coveting the other's life. Leslye Headland, whose play ''Bachelorette'' was an Off Broadway hit, will reunite with her director on that dark comedy, Trip Cullman, for her new satire, ''Assistance,'' about young assistants suffering humiliations working for a powerful magnate. And Sam Gold will direct ''The Big Meal,'' a love story that spans 80 years, written by Dan LeFranc (''Sixty Miles to Silver Lake'').", "headline": {"main": "ARTS, BRIEFLY: Playwrights Horizons Sets 2011-12 Season"}, "abstract": "Playwrights Horizons announces five of the six productions for its 2011-12 lineup, including premiere of Gina Gionfriddo play Rapture, Blister, Burn.
