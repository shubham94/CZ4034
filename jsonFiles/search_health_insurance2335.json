While that description is not necessarily wrong, it strikes me as self-fulfilling (since the controversy usually originates in media reports on how controversial Mr. Moore is) and trivial. Any filmmaker, politically outspoken or not, whose work is worth discussing will be argued about. But in Mr. Moore's case the arguments are more often about him than about the subjects of his movies. Some of this is undoubtedly his fault, or at least a byproduct of his style. His regular-guy, happy-warrior personality plays a large part in the movies and in their publicity campaigns, and he has no use for neutrality, balance or objectivity. More than that, his polemical, left-populist manner seems calculated to drive guardians of conventional wisdom bananas. That is because conventional wisdom seems to hold, against much available evidence, that liberalism is an elite ideology, and that the authentic vox populi always comes from the right. Mr. Moore, therefore, must be an oxymoron or a hypocrite of some kind.", "headline": {"main": "Open Wide and Say 'Shame'", "kicker": "MOVIE REVIEW | 'SICKO'"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1022, "_id": "4fd25d0f8eb7c8105d80b5e3", "snippet": "It has become a journalistic clich\u00e9 and therefore an inevitable part of the prerelease discussion of ''Sicko'' to refer to Michael Moore as a controversial, polarizing figure.
