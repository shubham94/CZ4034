''THE stress on American families now is of a different order than ever before,'' said Dr. M. Harvey Brenner, an economist and medical sociologist at Johns Hopkins University.

Although the conference had been planned months before last week's announcement that national unemployment had reached a 40-year high of 10.1 percent, many of the researchers' studies dealt with the toll of joblessness and economic calamity.", "snippet": "DURHAM, N.H.
