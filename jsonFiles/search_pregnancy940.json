For several years, Kenji Matsuura, a biologist at Okayama University in Japan, has studied these faux eggs, which he calls termite balls.

With its 206 minutes spread luxuriously over two discs (the 195-minute feature has now been filled out with its overture, intermission and exit music), the ''Ryan's Daughter'' DVD may not recreate the endangered experience of wide-gauge filmmaking (somehow, those Imax documentaries just aren't the same), but it does suggest its breathtaking scale. Following ''Lawrence of Arabia'' (1962) and ''Doctor Zhivago'' (1965), ''Ryan's Daughter'' (1970) was the final and, for most critics, least successful collaboration of Lean, the screenwriter Robert Bolt and the cinematographer Freddie Young.
