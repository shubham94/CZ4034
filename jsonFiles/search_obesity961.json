They were deliberately cryptic. All they would tell St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center was that they were looking into a possible violation of the federal ''anti-dumping'' law, which prohibits hospitals from refusing to at least examine and stabilize patients who cannot pay.

The previous July, a French woman in her 40's had come to the emergency room with abdominal pain. Pelvic cancer was suspected, and she was admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology floor, where the diagnosis was confirmed. A private doctor, along with the house staff, attended to her. The doctor concluded that she needed surgery within several weeks followed by chemotherapy. The woman had no insurance. The senior physician discharged her, and left a note on the woman's chart saying she had instructed her to obtain health insurance or go to a public hospital.", "snippet": "The investigators came late last January, on a Thursday.
