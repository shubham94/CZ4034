Researchers said the finding could aid understanding of the causes of endometrial cancer, which strikes 37,000 American women each year and kills 2,900. The new report corroborates earlier evidence that smoking lowers the incidence of endometrial cancer and is consistent with previously observed links between smoking and estrogen-related body changes on the one hand and between estrogen levels and rates of endometrial cancer on the other. Estrogen, an important female hormone, is known to stimulate growth of cells in the endometrium and is believed to promote cancer when it is not counterbalanced by another hormone.", "headline": {"main": "HEAVY SMOKING FOUND TO CURB CANCER OF THE UTERUS LINING"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "20", "word_count": 762, "_id": "4fd148738eb7c8105d624f3a", "snippet": "Heavy cigarette smoking by women reduces their risk of developing cancer of the lining of the uterus, the endometrium, but this benefit is vastly outweighed by other health hazards of smoking, according to a new report.

Although the vast majority of American doctors are considered competent, there have been complaints since the states began licensing physicians a century ago that no one was policing the medical profession adequately. Critics contended that the small minority of doctors who were incompetent, malevolent or infirm often were being allowed to continue treating patients, harming or killing uncounted numbers of them. Those complaints persist. At the same time, concerns over the rising expense of American medical care, estimated at more than $1 billion a day, have forced new attention on the problem because medical incompetence can be terribly expensive.", "headline": {"main": "U.S., INDUSTRY AND PHYSICIANS ATTACK MEDICAL MALPRACTICE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 3215, "_id": "4fd1633d8eb7c8105d64ec3f", "snippet": "After decades of little action, the Federal Government, industry and organized medicine have begun a new attack on the problem of medical malpractice and incompetence.
