With his big ego, big lapels, big ties, big hair and pea-sized brain, Ron is every newsman who's ever told us ''This is what's happening in your world tonight!'' while remaining clueless about anything happening beyond his own teleprompter. Ron Burgundy has only one flaming passion: to end up in the big time of network news. You have to laugh -- until you realize that he and countless others like him have made just that leap in the three decades since. The local news revolution nailed in this movie -- the dictum that the popularity of a news ''personality'' with the viewers, not the story, must always come first -- has long since overrun most of both network and cable news. (The occasional holdout, typified by ''Nightline,'' must often fight for its life or be subsidized at PBS.) No sooner do we rejoice at the demise of much of the 70's cultural detritus lampooned in ''Anchorman,'' from polyester leisure suits to unembarrassed on-camera sexism, than we start wondering if TV news may be even more farcical now than it was then. But these days the farce isn't so funny. The worst damage committed by Ron Burgundy at the movie's mythical News Center 4 of San Diego is to overplay the pregnancy of a panda at the San Diego Zoo.
