Here are their suggestions for tasteful, creative and thoughtful alternatives for a friend with an ailment, whether it is a broken ankle or a broken marriage. ANNA BAHNEY MARYJANE BUTTERS, an organic farmer and author who lives in Moscow, Idaho, sells her food products in health food stores and on her Web site. I usually go to the person's home. I'll bring something along, some food maybe, but that's not as important as showing up. Do you need your cow milked? A foot rub? Can I draw you a bath? Clean up? Any little thing. For people in a rural area, the methodology is to outdo each other with kindness. It is the kindness Olympics. www.maryjanesfarm.com AMANDA POSES moved her Fill-R-Up gift basket company out of her Manhattan home to Lexington Avenue when she began getting requests for get-well packages in addition to her party baskets. For people in the hospital, I've been giving spa items: flip-flops, lotions, hand creams. It is so dry in the hospital. It is nice to have flip-flops rather than walking around barefoot. And the lotions smell good -- I usually put in lavender. I try to throw in a candle, but usually patients aren't allowed to light it. www.fill-r-up.com BARBARA KAVOVIT, chief executive of Barbara K Enterprises in Manhattan, creator of a 30-piece tool kit featuring items that are weighted and contoured for women's hands. I send the Barbara K Tool Kit. I send it to people who are going through a divorce. Or maybe someone in the family has passed away. A child is off to school. A situation brings you down. If you can't get up in the morning, that's an illness. It affects your job, your children. I give a set of tools. Things that give you confidence. That puts you back into your soul, your spirit, because you have enhanced your surroundings. www.barbarak.com SUSIE COELHO, host of HGTV's ''Outer Spaces'' and author of ''Everyday Styling,'' lives in La Canada, Calif. and knows from a good get-well: she was on bed rest for four months during her first pregnancy. As soon as something goes wrong with your health, you are introverted. One of the best gifts that you can give is to set a date when the person you're giving to will be better, and spend time planning a party. That really puts the future there. Every time you come by, you can do a little bit, and get that person looking forward to something. Another thing is to hire a hairstylist, a manicurist or a reflexologist to come to their home. www.susiecoelho.com", "headline": {"main": "Say It With Flowers, Or Go Milk Their Cow"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "14", "word_count": 474, "_id": "4fd256b18eb7c8105d800ab4", "snippet": "THE ease of ordering flowers has caused fresh-cut bouquets to become the default get-well gift.
