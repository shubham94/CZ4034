The agency told makers of 34 pesticides tested by Industrial Bio-Test, one of the biggest testing laboratories in the country, that they had 90 days to offer new test data or to make a commitment to do further work to obtain data. If they failed to do so, registration of the products would be suspended, meaning the pesticides could not be sold legally. But the agency did not set any time limit for the companies to provide new information if further testing was required. The findings of Industrial Bio-Test have been thrown out and officers of the company are now on trial in Chicago on Federal criminal charges of misrepresenting test data.", "headline": {"main": "E.P.A.

Michael Le Coney, a health-care analyst at Merrill Lynch, figures that there is no easier way to raise money than to start a healthcare company. At a clip of something like one a week, new entrants with big dreams and scant revenues are going public. Investors pounce. Stock prices soar. ''Seemingly anybody can do it,'' Mr. Le Coney says. ''It's beyond belief.'' This is the story of how one health-care company - the Genetic Systems Corporation - sprang from a magazine article and a well-timed phone call and has begun to hit paydirt. The Blech Brothers In the summer of 1980, David Blech was a 24-year-old stockbroker on Wall Street. His brother, Isaac, was 30, working in advertising and public relations. Any spare dollars they had, they gambled in hightechnology companies. Their stockpile of money grew.
