He was 88. The funeral will be held on Wednesday, May 28, at 11am at Robert Schoem's Memorial Chapel, 150 New Jersey 4, in Paramus, NJ, followed by burial in Union, NJ. Born February 10, 1926, in Philadelphia to Reba (formerly Kligman) and Phillip, Mel grew up during the Depression as the only child of his older immigrant parents and the half-brother of Al, Edith, Norma, Rose, and Sylvia. A brilliant student, he made his own way in the world. Mel earned a full scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania and although his studies were interrupted for U.S. Navy service during World War II, he graduated in 1947 with a bachelor's in Mathematics. He became an actuary at The Prudential in Newark and passed the stringent actuarial exams on the first try. After marrying Shifra \"Sherry\" Gerber, they moved to Israel, where Mel worked for Migdal Insurance. When they returned to the States, they settled in West Orange, NJ, and he later founded Melvin L. Gold & Associates, a leading actuarial consultancy. He was instrumental in the growth of several insurance companies, most notably Presidential Life, and served on the board for years. Mel was ahead of his time on an array of professional, social, and health issues. For example, almost 20 years ago, in a Letter to the Editor of The New York Times he took to task an article about Social Security reform that did not discuss what he believed was a \"clear solution\" promptly raising the retirement age to 70, and then beyond as life expectancies increased. In another favorite letter in The New York Times, he suggested all election ballots include an option for voters to select, \"None of the above.\" Mel liked being unconventional. In college, he proactively partnered with a black bridge player when others wouldn't consider it. Despite being excluded from numerous tournaments because of race, the duo became nationally ranked college champions. When Best's Review insurance magazine wanted to put him on the cover, they asked for a photo. Instead of a headshot, he sent one showing him jogging past the ancient pyramids in Egypt. Mel also took his health very seriously and in his 40s, realized that food has a profound impact on well-being. He shunned salt, red meat, alcohol, coffee, desserts, and fats. His signature drink became hot water. In philanthropy, he was most passionate about Israel and Judaism, strongly supporting Yiddish culture and Young Judaea. Mel was a world traveler, sculptor, and athlete. He ran the Jersey Shore Marathon in middle age and loved sailing on Bantam Lake, CT, where he summered for the last 50 years. He had gusto for life unmatched except by his loving wife and partner-in-adventure for 64 years. They loved to sing and dance, and Mel was expected to belt out \"Tum Balalaika\" and dance the kazatske at every family celebration. Mel is survived by Shifra; his four children Charles of New York, NY, and his wife, Anne Kohn; Neil of Fair Lawn, NJ; Ronald of Saddle River, NJ, and his wife, Betsy August Gold; and Nina of Fair Lawn, NJ, and her husband, Raviv Ron; and his seven grandchildren Stephanie, Jacqueline, Alexandra, Samuel, and Jacob Gold, and Avital and Maya Ron. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate donations to Young Judaea, 575 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY, 10018, or The National Yiddish Theatre -- Folksbiene, 90 John Street, New York, NY, 10038.", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  GOLD, MELVIN LEONARD"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "21", "word_count": "593", "_id": "53c5af2579881044e1d77cc3", "snippet": "GOLD--Melvin Leonard, one of the nation's foremost actuaries, died at his Teaneck home on Memorial Day after a well-fought battle with Parkinson's.
