Not to put too much pressure on the ''Friends'' writers, but has any show ever gotten better after the birth of its season-ending bundle of joy? Here's some advice for any television writer itching to get into bed with the old cliffhanger-pregnancy plot line: think back to your high school sex-education class, especially the part where you had to carry around an egg for a week to simulate the inescapable responsibilities of parenthood. A series shouldn't have a sweeps baby unless it's ready for that baby to be there for the next 22 (or 44 or 66) episodes. And don't expect a sweeps baby to save a failing series, either. Did ''The X-Files'' regain its luster after Scully had her miracle baby? Did ''Mad About You'' finally get funny after the Buchmans conceived?
