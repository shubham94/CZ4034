A study of Vietnam veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder has found them more likely than other veterans to have serious physical illnesses as well, including heart disease and infections and disorders of the digestive, respiratory and musculoskeletal systems. People with post-traumatic stress disorder are often troubled by nightmares and flashbacks, vivid, horrific memories that invade the mind without warning. The condition, which used to be called shell shock or combat fatigue, commonly leads to anxiety and depression. Veterans are not the only vulnerable ones; crime victims, police officers and firefighters are also at risk, though not everyone with a traumatic experience develops the disorder.", "headline": {"main": "War Memories May Harm Health"}, "abstract": "Study of Vietnam veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder finds them more likely than other veterans to have serious physical illnesses as well, including heart disease and infections and disorders of digestive, respiratory and musculoskeletal systems (M)", "print_page": "9", "word_count": 639, "_id": "4fd1f5458eb7c8105d74eb39", "snippet": "TERRIBLE memories of war that persist in a soldier's mind for years or even decades may take a physical toll as well as an emotional one.
