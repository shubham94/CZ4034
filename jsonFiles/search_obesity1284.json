Based on early findings from new studies, some experts now predict that manipulation of a woman's hormones through diet and exercise or perhaps simple drug therapy may help to keep the disease at bay. The suggested changes involve following a low-fat or low-calorie diet throughout life and pursuing vigorous physical activity, especially during the teens and early adult years. Although a decade or more of research needs to be completed before the effectiveness of such measures is fully known, the investigators point out that good diet and exercise habits can only help, not hurt. At the least, they would reduce the risk of developing heart disease and obesity and its attendant health problems.", "snippet": "Breast cancer, a disease that will strike one in 11 American women, has in the last few years forced researchers back to square one in their efforts to understand its causes and develop methods of prevention.
