After a debate that generated considerable controversy in the last week, the Assembly vote was 147 to 1. A United States delegate said the American vote reflected the Reagan Administration's belief that the $89,000 expenditure on the publication was ''wasteful'' because the information was generally available elsewhere, although not all in one place. The delegate, Dennis C. Goodman, said the United States agreed in principle with the idea of protecting one country from products restricted by another, adding, ''We are more open on this subject than anyone else.''", "headline": {"main": "U.S. LONE DISSENTER IN U.N.

Their calculators are focusing on the difference in the way married and single people voted. While an overwhelming majority of married voters preferred Mr. Reagan over Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic candidate, the President's lead among single voters was much narrower, according to polls of voters. This ''marriage gap'' proved far larger than the ''gender gap'' between men and women. The differential according to marital status has been noticed before in election analyses, and its effect this year was dulled by Mr. Reagan's landslide.
