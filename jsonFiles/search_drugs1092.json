PASQUALE is executive director of Connecticut United for Research Excellence, a group known as CURE that promotes biomedical research. Recently CURE surveyed the biomedical industry in the state, concluding that it is contributing nearly $2 billion a year to the economy, and that there is potential for much more. \"No other state,\" she said, \"has quantified the enterprise the way we just have.\" CURE has five employees and an annual budget of about $500,000. Ms. Pasquale is a registered nurse with degrees from the University of Hartford School of Nursing and Yale who started in critical care and specialized in oncology and clinical trials before joining CURE. Recently she answered questions about CURE in an interview in Groton at Pfizer Inc., a founding member of CURE. Following are excerpts from that conversation. Q. Could you sum up what your studies concluded? A. Twenty-five years ago there was one company in Connecticut, Pfizer, and it had about a $15 million research and development budget. Today there are four large companies, which spent $1.2 billion in 1995. That represents 10 percent of all pharmaceutical research and development in the country. There are also a lot of Federal research dollars that come in; Connecticut ranks fourth in the nation per capita, and in the top 10 in total dollars. And we really haven't capitalized on the little companies. They love to associate with the big pharmaceuticals, which are already here. We have a tremendous opportunity to attract small biotechnology companies to the state. Q. Does $1.2 billion represent all spending by the big biomedical firms? A. No. It doesn't include capital investments, for instance. In 1995, capital expenditure was about $175 million. When you look at everything, the impact comes up to somewhere near $1.7 billion.", "headline": {"main": "Connecticut Q&A: Debra K.

The biggest surprise was the discovery announced today that the fastest, safest relief yet documented for migraines comes not from one of the many new drugs that are under development but from a veteran painkiller called lidocaine, perhaps best known as the drug dentists inject before performing root canals and as the painkiller in some over-the-counter sprays and lotions.
