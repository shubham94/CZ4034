Catherine Hardwicke directed this unorthodox romance, based on the novel by Stephenie Meyer and a script by Melissa Rosenberg. Peter Facinelli assumes a ghostly pallor as Carlisle, Edward's doctor father and the head of a picture-pretty, well-behaved clan (played by Ashley Greene, Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathbone and Kellan Lutz) that, but for occasional hunting sprees, likes to think of itself as, uh, vegetarian. Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called the film ''a deeply sincere, outright goofy vampire romance for the hot-not-to-trot abstinence set.'' 10:30 A.M.
