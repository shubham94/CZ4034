In a brief, unsigned opinion, the New York Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that only in limited circumstances -principally where a parent witnesses the death or injury of a child - can one be compensated for such emotional injuries. In this case, the court noted, the mother did not learn that she had lost her baby until a month after the test, known as amniocentesis, was performed. The majority in the decision stated that people may not recover damages for any emotional harm they suffer as a result of injury to a third party - in this case the fetus - unless they are in the ''zone of danger'' themselves and experience their own trauma simultaneously.", "headline": {"main": "DAMAGES REFLECTED IN DEATH OF FETUS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": 784, "_id": "4fd15d848eb7c8105d6451c7", "snippet": "A woman whose baby was stillborn as a result of prenatal testing cannot collect damages for her emotional distress, the state's highest court has ruled.
