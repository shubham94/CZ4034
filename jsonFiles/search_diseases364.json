The all-cash bid would give Crucell stakeholders 24.75 euros a share. Johnson & Johnson would acquire a company known for its research, manufacture and marketing of vaccines and antibodies. It bought its initial stake in Crucell for 300 million euros last year. Crucell shares rose 8.51 euros, or 54.19 percent, to 24.20 euros in Amsterdam on Friday, giving the company a market cap of nearly 2 billion euros. Fabian Smeets, an analyst at Rabo Securities, said he thought the bid might go higher. ''Johnson & Johnson could add a couple euros,'' Mr. Smeets said, citing Crucell's 500 million euros in cash. While other bidders may be in the wings, Crucell is bound by change-of-control clauses for certain products it makes and markets, including Quinvaxem, a vaccine against childhood diseases that it co-developed with Novartis and which is now a major revenue source for the Dutch company. Crucell could lose rights to the drug if it were sold to certain pharmaceutical competitors. Should the deal go through, Johnson & Johnson would maintain Crucell's management, staff levels and headquarters in Leiden, the Netherlands, the company said. The expectation of such a limited restructuring in the event of a takeover is one reason why Crucell prefers Johnson & Johnson, Mr. Smeets said, adding that it would occupy a special place in a company that allows for entrepreneurship, unlike some other drug makers. The last time Crucell was in play was just last year, but the bid from Wyeth fell through after it was taken over by Pfizer. --Chris V.
