Kinder-Care and La Petite Academies, two day-care center companies, are also realizing handsome gains in his portfolio. When asked why his investment picks cater to the preschool crowd, Mr. McKay answers simply, ''demographics.'' Because women born during the post-World War II baby boom are now having children, the swelling numbers of preschoolers translate into greater demand for child care products and services, a trend that savvy investors like Mr. McKay can prosper from. Demography is, in its broadest sense, the statistical study of population trends. While the United States Census Bureau has been putting together the data for decades, advanced computer technology and the greater use of market research have made demographics a more useful and sophisticated forecasting tool. Business planners and investors are increasingly scrutinizing income, occupation, education and lifestyle characteristics of targeted age groups to find better ways to position products and services, as well as personal investments, in coming years.", "headline": {"main": "PLAYING THE DEMOGRAPHICS GAME"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": 1654, "_id": "4fd14acd8eb7c8105d628518", "snippet": "-fund money manager, recently sold his company's position in Stride Rite Shoes, a maker of baby shoes, for two-and-a-half times the purchase price.

Interns would receive the district's starting salary for the year, a guaranteed $18,500 if Governor Kean gets the Legislature to underwrite base salaries.
