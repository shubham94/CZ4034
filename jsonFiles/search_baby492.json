The Future Is Not the Present Three years ago, in a small conference room at the offices of the law firm Hogan & Hartson in Washington, I had the chance to talk with John G. Roberts Jr. At the time, Roberts was a lawyer in private practice, unsure whether Senate Democrats would hold a hearing on his nomination to be a federal appellate judge. (After being nominated three times, in 1992, 2001 and 2003, he would finally be given a hearing and confirmed in May 2003 after Republicans took control of the Senate.) In a conversation over cookies and coffee, Roberts spoke candidly about a wide range of topics, and I was impressed by his modesty, intelligence and sense of humor.", "headline": {"main": "Roberts V.
