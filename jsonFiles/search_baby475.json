Her second burial, on March 19, had all the ceremony and solemnity of a hero's funeral.

He had come to build a church. McFarland, who was 36 at the time, knew little about leading churches and less about building them: he wasn't even halfway through the correspondence classes he was taking to become an evangelical pastor. Nevertheless, he'd been hired by a small group of Christians in an adjoining community to do just that. And so a few days after he arrived, he put on a pair of slacks and a polo shirt, said goodbye to his wife, Sandy, and their two kids, who had come to Surprise several weeks ahead of him to get settled in their new house, and set out to find believers. For decades, Surprise, which is about 45 minutes northwest of downtown Phoenix, was mostly scrubby cotton, rose and citrus fields, with a small grid of streets where migrant workers lived. In the early 90's, developers discovered the town. By the time McFarland and his family arrived, its population had climbed past 15,000, and more, many more, were on their way. Most of Surprise's new residents were young white families drawn to affordable homes and jobs within commuting distance. Many of them hadn't gone to college but no doubt hoped that their children would.", "headline": {"main": "The Soul of the New Exurb"}, "abstract": "Jonathan Mahler article on Radiant, Lee McFarland's Assemblies of God congregation in Surprise, Ariz, and similar conservative Christian megachurches that have established themselves in American exurbs; says large measure of Radiant's success derives from way it serves as locus for sprawling, decentralized community and operates almost like surrogate government, offering residents day care, athletic facilities, counseling and even schools, all paid for through voluntary tithing; says megachurches have been key part of Republican Party's gains among middle-class families in exurbia; photos (L)", "print_page": "30", "word_count": 8140, "_id": "4fd257228eb7c8105d8019b0", "snippet": "Radiant megachurch in Arizona offers financial planning, child care, counseling and Krispy Kremes with every sermon.
