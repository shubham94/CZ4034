''My feet are killing me'' may well be the most common health complaint. Feet are the most used and abused parts of the human body. According to a recent study conducted by the Pennsylvania College of Podiatric Medicine, the average American walks 115,000 miles - the equivalent of more than four times around the world - in a lifetime. With each step, minor abnormalities in foot structures or shoes that don't fit right, or both, can result in such ailments as corns, calluses, bunions and hammer toes. An estimated 87 percent of Americans suffer from a foot problem. Though these problems are not a direct threat to life, their presence can take the joy out of many life-enhancing activities and make others impossible. In summer, when warm weather and vacations prompt more walking than usual, foot problems are likely to become painfully apparent.", "snippet": "MILLIONS of Americans who might otherwise heed the advice of health experts to let their feet, rather than their fingers, do the walking are discouraged from doing so by aches and other discomforts in those lowermost appendages.
