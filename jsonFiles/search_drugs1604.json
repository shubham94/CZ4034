To those who have been following this proposed regulation, the delay could hardly have been a surprise: It was the 26th time that the agency had postponed action since the proposal was first made, in 1960. While 26 postponements in 25 years may be a record, there are a number of other proposed regulations for food, drug and cosmetic additives that have settled into a similar limbo. Here are some examples: * A decision to ban saccharin has been overridden by Congress periodically since 1977; * A decision to ban sulfites has been pending at the F.D.A. since 1982; * A ban on antibiotics in animal feed was first proposed in 1977 and action on it is still pending. At the end of 1984 there were 120 F.D.A. proposals dealing with food additives on which action was still pending. Some of them go back to 1973.", "headline": {"main": "THE SAGA OF A FOOD REGULATION: AFTER 25 YEARS, STILL NO DECISION"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2361, "_id": "4fd14c358eb7c8105d62adaf", "snippet": "ON Feb. 1 the Food and Drug Administration put off a decision to ban six artificial colors that have been found to cause cancer in test animals.
