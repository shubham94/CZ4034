If you accept the war metaphor (and not everyone does), then a diagnosis of cancer becomes a call to arms, an induction into an army, and it goes without saying that in such a war, optimism is essential. Memoirs of cancer survivors and the Web sites of some cancer centers state this as a creed: a ''positive attitude'' influences survival. But a recent Australian study of 204 people with lung cancer found that those who were optimistic before and after treatment did not live longer; they did not fare better (or worse) than their less hopeful counterparts. Earlier studies have examined cancer patients' helplessness or depression or pessimism. The results are a mixed bag, with some studies showing that a negative attitude hurts survival and others showing no relation between one's temperament and one's survival. What makes the Australian effort different is that it focused rigorously on a fairly large group of patients with a single type and stage of cancer, and it used a well-accepted method for assessing optimism. The study followed patients for five years. By taking these steps, the Australians overcame many (though not all) of their predecessors' methodological weaknesses. (Ideally, they would have examined whether optimism detected before a diagnosis of cancer was ever made -- optimism as a character trait, rather than as an attitude after diagnosis -- correlated with outcome.)", "headline": {"main": "Hope And Clarity", "kicker": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 2-22-04"}, "abstract": "Abraham Verghese article on Australian study showing that optimistic outlook does not help lung cancer patients live longer; says it would be salutary if study helped reduce pressure on patients to be optimistic, but it should not obscure fact that a positive attitude can improve quality, if not quantity, of time a patient has left, as he discovered in treating AIDS patients in days before disease became manageable; photo (M)", "print_page": "11", "word_count": 1076, "_id": "4fd24c188eb7c8105d7ebab1", "snippet": "In America, we have always taken it as an article of faith that we ''battle'' cancer; we attack it with knives, we poison it with chemotherapy or we blast it with radiation.
