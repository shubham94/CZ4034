As a former sales rep for individual health plans, I used a 145-page guide of exclusions for pre-existing conditions, ''hazardous'' activities and occupations, out-of-limit weight, and use of certain medications. Many of my friends who are covered by company group plans just don't understand the high cost exposure potential and the exorbitant premiums of individual plans which still don't provide coverage for many illnesses. Many holders of such plans are covered for the catastrophic costs, but are reluctant to get the colonoscopy or the CT scans recommended by the doctor because of high deductibles.
