This ordinary woman, as poor as any in this impoverished region of northern Nigeria, recently became horribly extraordinary: last June, an Islamic court in Sokoto, the regional capital, sentenced her to death by stoning for committing adultery. The evidence is the child she now feeds. The judge mandated that the sentence be carried out as soon as Adama is weaned. Sufiya, as the woman is known, has appealed the judgment, and a hearing is scheduled for the middle of March. But there is a good chance that the appeal will not save her. The recent introduction of the full sharia -- strict Islamic rule of law backed up by harsh punishments -- in 10 of Nigeria's 12 northern states is a highly political issue in the region, whose population is largely Islamic and whose courts are strongly influenced by the militant Islamists who have come to wield significant power.", "headline": {"main": "Death by Stoning"}, "abstract": "Richard Dowden article on workings of Islamic law in northern Nigeria focuses on case of Sufiyatu Huseini, who faces stoning for adultery; Huseini divorced husband because he could not support her, returned to live with her father and became pregnant when raped by man who seeks to marry her; pregnancy, considered proof of her adultery under strictest interpretation of Koran in force in her region, has delayed her execution until child is weaned; photos (L)", "print_page": "28", "word_count": 2784, "_id": "4fd22ab08eb7c8105d7b5a88", "snippet": "Sufiyatu Huseini sits on the earth floor of a tiny mud hut breast-feeding her 10-month-old daughter, Adama, and occasionally waving away flies that swarm around the child's eyes and mouth.
