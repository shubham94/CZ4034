(HBO) REPO MEN (2010) In this dystopic satire, adapted from the novel ''The Repossession Mambo,'' by Eric Garcia (who wrote the screenplay with Garrett Lerner), and set 20 years in the future, Jude Law, above, stars as Remy, an employee of a corporation called the Union. The company has developed synthetic, life-extending prostheses known as artiforgs for every body part. The implants can cost nearly $600,000 each and are sold by zealous door-to-door insurance salesmen. If someone falls too far behind in his payments, a repo man arrives on the scene with a body scanner and a scalpel, the better to detect company property and cut it out. But when Remy tries to reclaim the artificial heart of a musician named T-Bone (the rapper RZA), he's knocked unconscious from an electric shock and emerges from a coma to discover that he, too, has been implanted with a fake pumper. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said that ''as a recession-era satire,'' this nasty, comic thriller from Miguel Sapochnik ''strikes a very bitter chord.'' He added: ''In today's climate of widespread home foreclosures in which most banks refuse to modify the terms of mortgages, the movie offers a grotesque funhouse reflection of this scarily Darwinian environment. Then there is the matter of escalating health care costs and the insurance industry's resistance to reform. We are halfway there already.''
