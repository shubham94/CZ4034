RICHARD RESTAK, neurologist: ''The Brain.'' I don't discuss my writing with medical colleagues any more than I discuss my patients with journalists and editors. With patients, the situation is more complicated. They often can tell if their doctor is interested in them for themselves or only as background for a book. I constantly remind myself, therefore, that my patients are like patients in every age and every place: they seek a cure or some palliation for their suffering or, at the very least, someone who will accept them, listen to them and thereby help them in ways that cannot always be explained. PENELOPE LEACH, psychologist: ''Your Baby and Child.'' One day I was a research psychologist discussing Apgar scores (a measure of newborns' physical condition) with medical colleagues. Next day I was a mother, asking my baby's Apgar and being told, ''Leave that to us.'' Still resenting the authoritarianism, the chauvinism of some doctors dealing with people they insist on addressing as ''Mother,'' I have learned how deep a communication gulf there can be, even when doctors acknowledge parents' rights and try to explain. Sick children mean anxious parents who may be unable to hear the doctor's messages.
