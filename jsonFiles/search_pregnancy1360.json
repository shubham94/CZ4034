Of course, election year politics explains the rush to yet another showdown. But that hardly justifies lawmakers playing so fast and loose with women's health and constitutional rights, or the fundamental dishonesty of the entire exercise. This latest version contains some new language defining the procedures covered, but the tinkering still leaves a wide chasm between what its proponents say the ban would do and what the bill actually says. Although described by its proponents as a narrow attack on one late-term abortion procedure, the measure can be read to outlaw procedures commonly used throughout all stages of pregnancy. Like earlier versions, the new House bill contains no exception to protect the health of the pregnant woman and does not use medical terminology to describe the actions it is criminalizing, leaving its terms unconstitutionally vague.", "headline": {"main": "'Partial Birth' Electioneering"}, "abstract": "Editorial observes that neither imminent review of issue by Supreme Court nor promise of yet another presidential veto could deter House from its familiar ritual of voting to impose a national ban on so-called partial birth abortion; scores lawmakers for playing 'so fast and loose' with women's health and constitutional rights", "print_page": "22", "word_count": 288, "_id": "4fd207728eb7c8105d7715b8", "snippet": "Neither imminent review of the issue by the Supreme Court nor the promise of yet another presidential veto could deter the House on Wednesday from its familiar ritual of voting to impose a national ban on so-called partial birth abortion.
