America's food industry, more than happy to get behind any new diet as long as it doesn't actually involve eating less food, is still gung-ho on Low Carb, it's true, but in the last few weeks, I can report some modest success securing a crust of bread, and even the occasional noodle, at tables from which such staples were banned only a few months ago. Surveying the wreckage of this latest dietary storm makes you wonder if we won't someday talk about a food fad that demonized bread, of all things, in the same breath we talk about the all-grape diet that Dr. John Harvey Kellogg used to administer to patients at his legendarily nutty sanitarium at Battle Creek, Mich., or the contemporaneous vogue for ''Fletcherizing'' -- chewing each bite of food as many as 100 times -- introduced by Horace Fletcher (also known as the Great Masticator) at the turn of the last century. That period marked the first golden age of American food faddism, though of course its exponents spoke not in terms of fashion but of ''scientific eating,'' much as we do now. Back then, the best nutritional science maintained that carnivory promoted the growth of toxic bacteria in the colon; to battle these critters, Kellogg vilified meat and mounted a two-fronted assault on his patients' alimentary canals, introducing quantities of Bulgarian yogurt at both ends. It remains to be seen whether the Atkins-school theory of ketosis, the metabolic process by which the body resorts to burning its own fat when starved of carbohydrates, will someday seem as quaintly quackish as Kellogg's theory of colonic autointoxication.", "snippet": "It's not just Atkins mania.

The barbecue, the clambake, the chili contest, the fish fry, the hamburger cookout, the pancake social, the fried-chicken potluck, the spaghetti dinner -- these are the great entrees of American politics precisely because almost anyone can cook them and pretty much everybody likes them. Sure, the exact recipes differ from place to place, like accents, but that's the point. Political food contains the core contradiction of America, our profound differences and essential sameness all on one plate. Nothing puts a politician more at ease than being able to sing our national unity and diversity at the same time. And what says E Pluribus Unum as literally and zestily as a bowl of four-alarm chili? Food on the campaign trail is a lot like the nominee's body language or a spouse's performance in public. It seems inconsequential, yet the wizards in touch with the dark arts of internal polling know it is crucial in some primordial and awesome way. A candidate's relationship to democratic food is all about authenticity, about being one of us even as we elevate him beyond us: similar yet different. Food is to the modern candidate what a childhood spent in a log cabin was to 19th-century politicians -- a metaphor for being in touch with the life of the common voter. Every politician needs to find a way to portray himself as comfortable around democratic food. All of which, in some way, explains the Wendy's incident.", "snippet": "The hypocrisy of campaign-trail eating.", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "BUSH, GEORGE W", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "KERRY, JOHN", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (US)", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2004", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "FOOD", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "88", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 1462, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
