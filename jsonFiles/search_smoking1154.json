It has taken action that could lead to an order to the manufacturer to repair the scanners. The agency said that some of the computer axial tomography, or CAT, scanners designed and built by the Technicare Corporation sometimes turned on without a technician's command. This could repeat a scan and expose the patient ''to unnecessary and possibly hazardous amounts of radiation,'' the agency said. Joseph G. Teague, president of Technicare, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, the health care conglomerate, said the problem was so minor and infrequent that further action by the F.D.A. was unnecessary. He said an operator could circumvent the problem by not using a particular control switch.", "snippet": "The Food and Drug Administration says it has found a defect that may pose ''a risk of injury'' in 238 sophisticated X-ray scanners around the country.
