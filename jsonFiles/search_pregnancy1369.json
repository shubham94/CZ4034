One minute the circular foyer is empty. The next, it contains a slight, straight-haired young woman, bare-legged below a slim black skirt, wearing red flip-flops and no apparent makeup. It's a dancer's entrance more than an actress's, both in its reliance on the eloquence of line and carriage and in its air of waiting for the music to begin. And though at 11 a.m. on a foggy May morning the cafe is nearly deserted, and the young woman unassumingly pretty and visibly pregnant, those heads that are present turn. It is suddenly no longer possible to be unaware of the difference between ''at rest'' and ''in motion.'' That the 27-year-old Ms. Newton, who intended to be a dancer and trained intensively from ages 11 to 16, commands a body language that rivals in precision her Cambridge-educated English (she took her degree in anthropology) will surprise no one who saw her in Bernardo Bertolucci's ''Besieged'' (1998). As an African medical student supporting her studies in Rome by housecleaning for an expatriate British pianist (David Thewlis), Ms. Newton conveyed, in a single slow twist of her fingers across her lips, as much fascination with an alien culture, as much awareness of the temptations of both losing and affirming oneself through desire, as the passionate declarations of Mr. Thewlis's character.", "headline": {"main": "Poised for a Liberating Dance With Stardom", "kicker": "FILM"}, "abstract": "Article on actress Thandie Newton, whose latest role is in John Woo's Mission Impossible sequence, M:i-2; photo (M)", "print_page": "23", "word_count": 1697, "_id": "4fd213598eb7c8105d78a69d", "snippet": "THANDIE NEWTON, the British actress who will be seen on screen under John Woo's direction inflaming the passions of three men with chiseled jaws (including Tom Cruise) when ''M:i-2,'' the ''Mission: Impossible'' sequel, opens on Wednesday, does not...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/21/movies/film-poised-for-a-liberating-dance-with-stardom.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "M:I-2 (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "NEWTON, THANDIE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WOO, JOHN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Ariel", "lastname": "SWARTLEY"}], "original": "By ARIEL SWARTLEY"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2000-05-21T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Movies; Arts"}, {"type_of_material": "Letter", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Science Desk", "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: I had my first child at age 36 and was pleased with my ultrasounds and all of the blood tests results.
