(Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) In the summer of 1999, two friends from the Boston area wandered into sun-blasted Carlsbad Caverns National Park with three pints of water between them and got lost; when a ranger found them four days later, one was badly dehydrated, the other stabbed to death by his friend. The mystery is why he was killed. This ''ruminative, wholly absorbing'' account unfolds with ''quiet authority, lending unexpected dignity to the whole affair,'' our reviewer, Bruce Barcott, wrote in the Book Review last year. THE GREAT WAVE: Gilded Age Misfits, Japanese Eccentrics, and the Opening of Old Japan, by Christopher Benfey. (Random House, $14.95.) In the years after Commodore Perry hit the shores of Japan in 1853, new perceptions took hold among American and Japanese artists, thinkers and writers, a cultural give-and-take that still echoes today. Benfey ''brings to his subject a scholar's thoroughness, a critic's astuteness and a storyteller's sense of drama,'' William Deresiewicz said here in 2003. The result is a ''symphony not only of characters but of ideas.'' EARLY OCCULT MEMORY SYSTEMS OF THE LOWER MIDWEST, by B. H. Fairchild. (Norton, $13.95.) Winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award, this collection of poetry resonates with loneliness as it conjures history writ large and small in the plains and small towns of the Midwest. The poems display ''the American voice at its best: confident and conflicted, celebratory and melancholic,'' Michael Hainey wrote in these pages last year. LIARS AND SAINTS, by Maile Meloy. (Scribner, $13.) In this first novel, the fortunes of four generations of a Roman Catholic family in Southern California are wrapped up in a family secret: the matriarch tries to conceal the unwanted pregnancy of her teenage daughter by pretending the baby is actually hers, a ruse that requires delicate planning, to say the least. The result is a ''spectacular'' book that ''explores religion and faith from nearly every possible angle, with equal empathy for the faithful and doubting alike,'' Sara Mosle said here in 2003. THE PRINCE OF PROVIDENCE: The Rise and Fall of Buddy Cianci, America's Most Notorious Mayor, by Mike Stanton. (Random House, $14.95.) Coarse, profane and funny (often at the same time), the larger-than-life Cianci lorded over Providence, R.I., for more than 20 years, running a brazen criminal enterprise of kickbacks, shakedowns and threats before landing in jail in 2002. Last year our reviewer, Clyde Haberman, found this a flawed account, but one with ''impressive'' reportage and ''great yarns.'' THE HILLS AT HOME, by Nancy Clark. (Anchor, $14.95.) This first novel, about an extended WASP family gathered under the roof of a rambling, 200-year-old clapboard home in New England, is filled with the haphazard encounters that make up domestic life and the inflections of opinionated people who share meals, territory and belongings with uneasy familiarity. Clark's ''graceful, intelligent and very funny'' book ''reminds us that the tribe has not vanished, and that we're all members of it,'' Roxana Robinson said in these pages in 2003. It ''succeeds brilliantly'' in its ''revelation of a particular kind of life.'' A HOLE IN THE HEART, by Christopher Marquis. (St. Martin's Griffin, $13.95.) Bean Jessup, the frumpy protagonist of this first novel by a Times correspondent, opens up to the beauty of Alaska when she falls in love and marries a carpenter in a fishing town; after disaster strikes, she perseveres with the help of her husband's kleptomaniac mother and the two head to San Francisco, and a new life. The message? ''Loving good people and losing them: that's life,'' Bruce Barcott wrote here in 2003. THE LANDSCAPE OF HISTORY: How Historians Map the Past, by John Lewis Gaddis. (Oxford University, $13.95.) Drawing on a series of lectures he gave at Oxford, a Yale professor explores the relationship between science and history. In 2002 in these pages, Alan Brinkley found this ''a bold and challenging book'' that ''provides a strong statement for our time of both the limits and the value of the historical enterprise.''
