[C1.] FOR THE PLAINTIFFS Richard F. Scruggs, the trial lawyer representing homeowners seeking money to pay for Hurricane Katrina damage, is folksy and smooth as molasses in court.

WARNS ON ACCOUNTING General Motors, a company once known as the model of corporate accounting, warned investors that its performance was threatened by ''ineffective'' controls over financial reporting.

[C4.] TWO BANKS, ONE PARTNERSHIP Carver Federal Savings Bank, the country's largest black financial institution, and Merrill Lynch have struck an unusual alliance that will provide the Wall Street firm entree into minority neighborhoods.
