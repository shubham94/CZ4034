Although the court rendered no final judgment on the issue, its reasoning in lifting the injunction gives us hope that the states will ultimately be able to use their Medicaid plans as a crowbar to pry broader discounts from the drug industry. The drug companies already give substantial rebates to the states on virtually all drugs purchased through their Medicaid programs for the poor. The program at issue in Maine, known as Maine Rx, seeks to extend such discounts beyond Medicaid, primarily to help residents with little or no insurance coverage for prescription drugs. The state will seek to negotiate rebates on their behalf from the manufacturers, and those rebates will be distributed to pharmacies to compensate them for selling drugs at discounted prices to the uninsured. Any manufacturer that refused to offer rebates would face a stiff penalty -- its drugs could not be prescribed by doctors for Medicaid patients in Maine without ''prior authorization,'' a bureaucratic hurdle that would greatly curtail sales.", "headline": {"main": "Demanding Discounts on Drugs"}, "abstract": "Editorial hails Supreme Court decision lifting injunction that barred Maine from using its purchasing power under Medicaid to press drug companies for discounts for uninsured; notes Court largely rejected drug industry's arguments against program; suggests Maine may have gone too far in not setting income limits", "print_page": "14", "word_count": 452, "_id": "4fd23fca8eb7c8105d7d7079", "snippet": "State efforts to obtain big discounts on prescription drugs for uninsured residents got a welcome boost from the Supreme Court this week.
