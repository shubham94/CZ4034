That frosty heart belongs to Peter McGowan (Kenneth Branagh), a whiny, cynical British-American playwright, nicknamed America's Favorite Bastard, who lives comfortably in a Los Angeles suburb with his wife, Melanie (Robin Wright Penn). In trying to imagine possible parallels between Peter and any living playwright, none come to mind. That's just as well, since the lack of biographical verisimilitude frees the movie to go its own zany way. And besides, Peter is, to put it plainly, a royal pain in the neck whose response to the simplest question is a snidely clever rejoinder. It is a tribute to Mr. Branagh's considerable comic skills that he succeeds in making a potentially insufferable character likable by infusing him with the same sly charm that Michael Caine musters to seduce us into cozying up to his sleazier alter egos.", "headline": {"main": "A Tale of 2 Neighbors, Both Pains in the Neck", "kicker": "FILM REVIEW"}, "abstract": "Stephen Holden reviews play How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog, written and directed by Michael Kalesniko; Kenneth Branagh and Robin Wright Penn star; photo (M)", "print_page": "12", "word_count": 914, "_id": "4fd282748eb7c8105d84fe52", "snippet": "Michael Kalesniko's acerbic comedy, ''How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog,'' is a Hollywood rarity, a movie about an icy grown-up heart-warmed by a child that doesn't wield emotional pliers to try to squeeze out tears.
