Pediatrician, researcher and educator, he had a long and distinguished career in academic medicine and public service. Born in Pelham, NY, in 1921 to Joseph and Edith (Rosenfield) Lowe, he attended Horace Mann and earned degrees from Harvard College (cum laude) 1942 and Yale Medical School (cum laude) 1945. After an internship at Children's Hospital, Boston, he became chief resident of pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, where his research led him to discover a sex-linked metabolic disorder known as Lowe Syndrome, OCRL (oculo-cerebro-renal) syndrome. In 1948, he joined the University of Minnesota as a National Research Council Fellow and was later appointed Assistant Professor of Pediatrics. Three years later he joined the faculty of the University of Buffalo, NY, where he became Professor of Medicine and a Buswell Fellow. He spent a two-year sabbatical at the Virus Research Laboratory at Cambridge University, England. From 1965-1968, he was professor of pediatrics and director of the Human Development Center at the University of Florida, Gainesville. While there, he completed a national survey of nutrition among pre-school children and conducted studies on the modification of human metabolism in metabolic diseases. In 1968 he became the Scientific Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NIH, Bethesda, MD. He left NICHD to become Special Assistant for Child Health Affairs to the Assistant Secretary of Health in the Ford Administration. He returned to NICHD in 1983, and spent the rest of his career there. One project was working to develop a vaccine for Typhoid fever that took him to Nepal, where he was able to enjoy trekking in the Himalayas and carry on his life-long love of mountain climbing. Among his many contributions while at the NIH, in 1973, he was instrumental in creating an on-site child care center. During his career, Dr. Lowe was awarded many honors, contributed over 100 articles to leading medical and scientific journals, and founded the journal \"Pediatric Research\" for which he served as editor for 12 years. After retiring in 1994, Charles moved to Cambridge, MA, where he immersed himself in Harvard life, by auditing classes, fundraising, and serving as historian and archivist for Lowell House, his undergraduate residence. Dr. Lowe was a skilled wood worker, astute art collector, and avid gardener. He took special pride in restoration of his historic home in Woods Hole, MA that burned down in an accidental fire. In his retirement he wrote, \"Time Out of Mind: An Afghan Adventure,\" a book about his trip through Afghanistan and India in 1954, illustrated with own photographs. Charles is survived by his beloved wife, Barbara Bitting Frazer, his four loving children, Sarah M. Lowe, (Elisabeth Smith) of Brooklyn, NY, Elizabeth E. Lowe of South Hero, VT, J.
