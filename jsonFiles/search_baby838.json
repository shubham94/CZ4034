In state legislatures around the country, abortion's opponents are winning a stealth war to limit women's right to choose. In many states, access to abortion is now prohibitively daunting for all but a small percentage of women. Today 84 percent of American counties have no abortion providers. North Dakota's only abortion doctor lives out of state and flies to Fargo once a week. In many states, women must drive four or five hours to the nearest clinic. The erosion of the constitutional right to choose abortion, supposedly guaranteed by Roe v. Wade, has three interlocking causes. The first is economics. Hospital abortion is now so expensive that women must go to doctors' offices or specialized abortion clinics. Clinics, in turn, cannot find the customers to stay in business outside major cities. The second factor is protesters' harassment and violence. Especially in small towns, few doctors are determined enough to risk their practices and even their lives to perform abortions. Linking these is a spate of new state laws that provide the final blow to any doctor still interested in performing abortions and block a woman's journey to a big-city clinic.", "headline": {"main": "States' Wrongs on Abortion"}, "abstract": "Editorial warns that abortion opponents in state legislatures around country are winning stealth war to limit women's constitutional right to choose; says right to choose requires extra vigilance (M)", "print_page": "14", "word_count": 593, "_id": "4fd208d78eb7c8105d773d0d", "snippet": "Although the debate about national abortion policy is the one drawing headlines, the real action on abortion today is not in Washington but in the states.
