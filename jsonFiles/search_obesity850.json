So McDonald's chicken nuggets, for example, are bits of meat, pressed and formed into shapes of standard weight, rather than actual pieces of chicken. Left alone, nature is just too variable for the bottom line. Restaurants may understand the concept of portion control, but clearly, many of their customers do not. For as two reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out last week, Americans are getting fatter and fatter.
