The budget challenges faced by firefighters and other first responders have probably affected preparedness, fire officials say, particularly in remote or lightly populated areas that often depend on larger cities or agencies for help in emergencies. Sunday's quake registered 7.2 and centered in a largely unpopulated area of northern Mexico. But a recent study by the California Emergency Management Agency found a majority of the state's households failing to meet recommendations for many basic emergency needs, like stockpiling water (a minimum of three gallons per person), reinforcing their homes and making disaster plans. \"We know that there's going to be an earthquake, and we know it's going to be a major natural disaster,\" said Lou Paulson, president of the California Professional Firefighters and a captain in the Contra Costa County fire protection district. \"And I don't want to be one of the people who stands in front of the state of California and says, 'We told you so.' \" [The New York Times]", "headline": {"main": "Sampler: Lack of Attention for Earthquake Preparations, and More Attention for 'Story of Stuff '", "kicker": "Bay Area"}, "abstract": "A sampling of news of interest to readers in the San Francisco Bay Area.", "print_page": null, "word_count": 1659, "_id": "4fd39a618eb7c8105d8d7943", "snippet": "A sampling of news of interest to readers in the San Francisco Bay Area.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/sampler-lack-of-attention-for-earthquake-preparations-and-more-attention-for-story-of-stuff/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Felicity", "lastname": "BARRINGER"}], "original": "By FELICITY BARRINGER"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2010-04-06T07:10:29Z", "section_name": "U.S."}, {"type_of_material": "Brief", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National", "lead_paragraph": "Six Massachusetts health insurers and an industry trade group filed suit Monday to challenge last week\u2019s denial by the state of nearly nine out of 10 rate increases requested by the companies.
