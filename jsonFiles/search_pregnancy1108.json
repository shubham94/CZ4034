Their eyes were full of wonderful mischief. Charlie Fish, my father, dated Grace Kelly when he was a teenager in Philadelphia, which, of course, was Her Serene Highness's hometown. Charlie and Grace remained friends throughout her too-brief life. Charlie visited the palace in Monaco. Grace would visit Philadelphia; they would drink beer together. Charlie was penniless but dapper in his ascot. He would be written up in the papers as one of the best-dressed at galas. But I knew the truth. However great he looked, no matter whom he charmed, he still left when I was 4.

H.I.V.-prevention programs in that part of the world have been under way for years -- there have been campaigns to raise awareness about AIDS and to promote the use of condoms; clinics have been established to conduct H.I.V. testing and to treat sexually transmitted diseases that may accelerate the spread of H.I.V.; more recently, schoolchildren have been taught the benefits of abstinence -- and yet the virus continues to spread. About a third of all sexually active adults in Botswana and South Africa carry H.I.V., a rate nearly 10 times higher than almost anywhere in the world outside Africa. These prevention efforts have been sensible -- abstaining from sex or using condoms consistently do prevent H.I.V. infection -- but their effects have been disappointing. There is another way to reduce the spread of H.I.V. -- one that is increasingly recognized by public-health experts but that has been relegated, thus far, to an afterthought: fidelity -- either in marriage or in a committed relationship. As experts come to understand more about the African AIDS epidemic, it seems clear that regular sexual contact with more than one person is the key human behavior that enables the rapid spread of H.I.V. Since 2002, international organizations have promoted an approach called ''A.B.C.,'' which stands for abstain, be faithful, use condoms. But the ''be faithful'' part has largely fallen through the cracks, and that may well have undermined efforts to fight the epidemic.", "headline": {"main": "The Fidelity Fix"}, "abstract": "Helen Epstein article on sexual fidelity as way to slow spread of AIDS virus in southern Africa; holds regular sexual contact with more than one person is key human behavior that enables rapid spread of HIV; notes most AIDS campaigns in region have avoided subject of infidelity and have seldom tried to spur monogamy; links drop in HIV-infection rate in Uganda to government program that frankly warns of AIDS risk and encourages people to stick with one partner; cites risks posed by prevalance in region of longer-term, simultaneous sexual relationships, which let virus spread to others quickly; drawing (M)", "print_page": "54", "word_count": 5341, "_id": "4fd2a1eb8eb7c8105d88712c", "snippet": "Why is it so hard to loosen the grip of AIDS on southern Africa?
