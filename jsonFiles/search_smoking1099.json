''Yes'' is the answer that continues to emerge from a growing body of research into the health effects of strenuous physical activity. Although people generally associate vigorous exercise with exhaustion and diminishing returns for their efforts, for the heart and blood vessels and for the body overall, it can mean greater resistance to fatigue and improved efficiency and stamina. The bones, joints, lungs, body weight, blood pressure, blood sugar and a person's emotional stability all stand to gain from regular exercise, as studies repeatedly demonstrate. A small but devoted group of scientists in the United States and abroad continue to do research on precisely what is happening physiologically to produce these benefits and on the types and amounts of exercise needed to achieve them. Their work shows that while physical fitness is no guarantee of cardiovascular health, it can significantly tip the balance in favor of resistance to debilitating diseases that plague the United States and other Western industrialized societies.", "snippet": "Can taxing the heart enhance health?

Their studies ask whether in the long run the benefits of vigorous exercise outweigh its risks, particularly with regard to the heart. Thus far, researchers say, their studies show that while strenuous activities like jogging can sometimes precipitate a heart attack, over a lifetime exercise directly lessens the chances of heart attack and premature death, even for people who have already suffered one heart attack. The studies also show that to be most protective, exercise should be ''vigorous.''", "snippet": "AS physical fitness increasingly becomes an American passion that is pursued  at times to the point of injury and even death, researchers are racing to clarify its effects on health and longevity and the physiological mechanisms that may account for..."}], "meta": {"offset": 0, "hits": 2, "time": 59}}}
