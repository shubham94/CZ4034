But soon it is obvious that Helen is not so much a cruel adult as an angry, cheated teenager. Life hasn't gone her way. She is in a wheelchair, captive to multiple sclerosis and a fear of abandonment by her only child, 17-year-old Matt, with whom she lives in a state of war and anguished love on Long Island in 1969. ''Pen,'' which opened last night at Playwrights Horizons, directed by Will Frears, has a lot to say, too much at times. But it is eloquent about its three characters' relationship to the past. Helen clings to it; Jerry, who abandoned Helen after she could no longer walk, is heading for a new life, like a swimmer speeding away from a sinking boat.

How do you measure the degree of disability in an unborn child and make an informed decision about denying or allowing that child life? In October of last year, our 15-year-old son committed suicide, following a long struggle with bipolar disorder. Although no prenatal test exists for this illness, I can only wonder what our actions might have been had we been told of his potential suffering. What if we had known that he might choose his own death over a life without peace? And what if we weren't told that we might have the privilege of knowing and loving a deep, smart, beautiful and talented boy for those 15 challenging, but oddly rich, years? I cannot begin to guess what our choice would have been. I only know that through all the heartbreak of his illness and death, we were blessed to parent our son for as long as we did. It seems impossible to put a quantitative value on a life not yet lived. Science both enlightens and burdens us with uncertain knowledge of what might have been.
