troops began searching, fortifying and patrolling Dora, one of Baghdad's bloodiest neighborhoods and one of the first covered by a new security plan, the body count has dropped steadily, with only 18 deaths last month. The challenge will be to keep the gains made there as American and Iraqi forces move on to other areas. A1 Storm Ravages Baja California Heavy rains destroyed homes, killed livestock and washed out roads through the middle of Baja California, but no people were killed, officials said, as the remnants of Tropical Storm John swept up the peninsula. A2 Iran Will Talk, Not Halt Program The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, met with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran and said the president was willing to enter into negotiations on his country's nuclear program but would not agree to suspend uranium enrichment beforehand, as demanded by the Security Council. A4 Italians Land in Lebanon Hundreds of Italian marines, and their armored vehicles, landed in southern Lebanon, the first large foreign contingent of what is to become a reinforced United Nations buffer force on the border with Israel. The arrival of an expected 1,000 Italian troops will bring the total peacekeeping force to 3,250 of a projected 15,000. A4 Iraqi Terror Leader Captured American and Iraqi troops have captured Hamid Juma Faris Jouri al-Saeedi, the second-ranking leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, who supervised the bombers of a revered Shiite shrine in Samarra, Iraq, last February. The act set off a wave of brutal sectarian violence, the Iraqi national security adviser said. A7 Murder Trial Sought for G.I.'s An Army investigator has recommended court martial on charges, including murder, that could lead to the death penalty for four infantrymen accused of raping a 14-year-old girl and killing her and her family in March, according to a report. Defense lawyers said they would file objections. A8 Fish Demand Outstrips Supply Fish farms are close to matching fishing fleets in supplying seafood to expanding global markets, but both sources of supply taken together are unlikely to keep up with demand fueled by rising populations and incomes, according to a report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. A6 Islamic School Investigated British police officers searched the grounds and buildings of the Islamic school Jameah Islameah, continuing the hunt for jihadist recruiters and trainers. The school has a failed academic record, precarious financial status and enrollment of fewer than a dozen students, despite having a reported total of 100 rooms. A9 NATIONAL A10-13 As Elections Draw Near, Republican Fear Grows Two independent political analysts have recently forecast a narrow Democratic takeover of the House, yet another sign that Republicans are entering the fall campaign with their control of the House in serious jeopardy, and the possibility of major losses in the Senate. A1 Immigrants Use Identity Theft Though most people think of identity theft as a financial crime, one of the most common forms involves illegal immigrants using fraudulent Social Security numbers to conduct their daily lives. This practice provides the backbone of some low-wage businesses and a boon to the Social Security trust fund. A1 Prosecuted Terror Cases Fall The number of terrorism cases brought by the Justice Department, which surged in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, has dropped sharply since 2002, and prosecutors are turning down hundreds of cases because of weak evidence and other legal problems, according to a new study. A9 Young Workers Face Hardships Young people in the nation's work force face a choppy job market, making it hard for many to cope with high housing costs and rising college debt. Entry-level wages are falling, according to the Economic Policy Institute, and the percentage of college graduates receiving health and pension benefits in their early jobs has dropped sharply. A10 After Polygamist's Arrest Daily life continues as usual in Colorado City and in the adjacent town of Hildale, where the polygamist leader Warren Jeffs's followers and wives live. Mr. Jeffs is expected to be taken to Washington County, Utah, to stand trial on two counts of rape as an accomplice. A10 Chicago Fire Kills Six Siblings An apartment fire on Chicago's North Side killed six siblings. The fire was probably caused by a candle used for light because there was no electricity, the authorities said. The children's mother and three other siblings were injured. A10 Governor Race Intensifies The race to succeed Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida has turned caustic in the final stretch before the primary election, with each of the leading Republican candidates scrambling to prove himself the most kindred to Mr. Bush and the Democrats trading charges of racism and devotion to special interests. A11 Medicare Chief to Resign Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is set to resign, according to news reports. Dr. McClellan was sworn in as administrator in March 2004 and supervises Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. A10 NEW YORK/REGION B1-5 Pension Burden Consumes Factory Town's Budget City officials in Lockport, N.Y., are watching their budget be swallowed by pension and retiree health care costs. Now the mayor is preparing to ask the city's unions for concessions, including curtailing salary increases and cutting benefits. Cities across New York State are only starting to grapple with these ''legacy costs'' and may face similar financial troubles in the future. A1 Trooper Dies From Injuries Three days after he was ambushed during a hunt for the state's most notorious fugitive, a New York State trooper died from a bullet wound despite efforts to save his life by amputating his leg. Another trooper shot that night is in serious condition and remains in a medically induced coma. B1 Suozzi Plays Up Long Record As he takes on Eliot Spitzer for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, Thomas R. Suozzi, left, has seized on a central theme: that he has management skills Mr. Spitzer does not. As proof he cites a long record of accomplishment as Nassau County executive. B1 Adelphi Sees a Renaissance A decade after a scandal put its very survival in jeopardy, Adelphi University has turned itself around. Enrollment is up, fund-raising has soared, and bulldozers are breaking ground for the biggest expansion in the college's history. B1 SPORTSMONDAY D1-8 Agassi Ends Career at Open It hardly ended with a whimper, yet it ended just the same for Andre Agassi, whose 21-year tennis career came to a close at the United States Open when he lost his third-round match against Benjamin Becker, a German ranked just 112th in the world. A1 ARTS E1-10 Commemorative Mozart CD's A small Dutch label, Brilliant Classics, has released ''Mozart Edition, Complete Works,'' a set of 170 CD's that include Mozart's operas, sacred works, concertos, symphonies and other works, to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth. E1 OBITUARIES B5-6 Dewey Redman An expansive and poetic tenor saxophonist and bandleader who had been at the aesthetic frontiers of jazz since the 1960's, he was 75. B5 BUSINESS DAY C1-6 Shift in Time Magazine Richard Stengel, the new managing editor of Time, plans to fill the pages of the magazine with more essays and news analysis, give it a sharper point of view and draw more brand-name journalists into the fold. C1 Direction of Vonage Vonage went public in May at $17 and bottomed out at $6.30 in July, but since then the stock has stabilized and climbed slightly. Today, the company plans to announce that it has attained 2 million subscribers, up from 1.6 million at the end of the first quarter. C1 Using Wikipedia Format Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia that lets anyone write and edit entries in a collaborative system, is operated by a nonprofit foundation. But ideas for advertising-based wiki sites are beginning to take their place as a staple of Silicon Valley business plans.
