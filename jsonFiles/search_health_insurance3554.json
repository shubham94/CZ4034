Lieberman abruptly shifted gears yesterday and focused instead on health care, an issue the Democrats have found works to their favor but one that Gov. George W. Bush homed in on hard over the weekend. Speaking in Albuquerque, Mr. Lieberman responded to Mr. Bush's charge that Democrats advocate big-government health care solutions by asserting that government does, in fact, have a role to play. Mocking Mr. Bush's health care record in Texas, Mr. Lieberman said: ''He says that we should leave no child behind. But in Texas he has left behind more than one million children who need health insurance. That's Governor Bush's real record, what that real record has meant to real people, real children.'' Then, defending the Democratic approach to health care, Mr. Lieberman said: ''Government can't and shouldn't do everything for everybody. But when it comes to a vital need such as health care, unless government stands up for people, millions of Americans will not have a real choice.''
