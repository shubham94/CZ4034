The pheromone mimic is a form of peroxide that slowly undergoes a chemical transformation to the pheromone of the natural pine beetle. It was discovered by R. Marshall Wilson while studying laser-induced basic chemical reactions of pheromone-like compounds. Pheromones are chemicals secreted by animals that effect the behavior of others of the same species and usually act as sex attractants.", "headline": {"main": "A New Beetle Barrier", "kicker": "SCIENCE WATCH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 628, "_id": "4fd124c48eb7c8105d5ea3ed", "snippet": "A synthetic pheromone-like chemical developed by a University of Cincinnati chemist has been found to disrupt the communication system of pine beetles, holding the promise of controlling the pest that annually destroys almost $1 billion worth of...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/06/science/science-watch-a-new-beetle-barrier.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PESTICIDES AND PESTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EXERCISE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INSECTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS AND DRUG TRADE"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1982-07-06T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Technology; Science; Health"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 250}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
