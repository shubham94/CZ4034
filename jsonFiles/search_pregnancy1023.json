The introduction to the first report paints a stark picture: Millions of infants die every year, mostly in the world's poorest regions, and about three-quarters of the deaths are easily preventable. Here is an excerpt. The proportion of child deaths that occurs in the neonatal period (38 percent in 2000) is increasing. Every year, an estimated 4 million babies die in the first 4 weeks of life. A similar number are stillborn, and 0.5 million mothers die from pregnancy-related causes. Three-quarters of neonatal deaths happen in the first week -- the highest risk of death is on the first day of life. Almost all (99 percent) neonatal deaths arise in low-income and middle-income countries .", "headline": {"main": "The Sorry, and Dangerous, State of Infant Health Care", "kicker": "READING FILE"}, "abstract": "Reading File column; excerpts from report in British medical journal Lancet about health care for babies, from Christina Larson article in Washington Monthly on why recent female action films have flopped, and from British sociologist Frank Furedi article in Spiked online contending that freedom of speech is under siege on campus; drawings (M)", "print_page": "4", "word_count": 276, "_id": "4fd25ae68eb7c8105d807868", "snippet": "The Lancet, the British medical journal, has published four reports, called the ''Neonatal Survival Series,'' about health care for babies in the first four weeks of life.
