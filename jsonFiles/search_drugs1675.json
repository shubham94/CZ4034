It was a session rife with partisan warfare between Mr. Reagan and Congressional Democrats, who blamed each other for problems ranging from growing deficits to the bombings in Lebanon.

Mr. Reagan's political magic, which seems to be verified in public opinion polls, was scarcely evident on Capitol Hill. Unlike its predecessor, the 98th Congress repeatedly defied the President on economic and military issues but, like many another Congress in a Presidential election year, it was timid in tackling some tough issues.", "headline": {"main": "CONGRESS, IN ITS 98TH SESSION, SLOWED PRESIDENT'S PROGRAM"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1583, "_id": "4fd13d6f8eb7c8105d613d7d", "snippet": "The 98th Congress, which adjourned Friday, slowed the momentum of President Reagan's efforts to change the scope and direction of Government, restoring funds for health, education and welfare and reducing his military spending requests.
