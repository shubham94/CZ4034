Inside the Palm Springs, Calif., convention center, which had been transformed into an elfish forest, with chiffon drapery and cherry blossoms, 4,500 men dressed -- partially at least -- in white were dancing to ear-shattering techno.

A silver-painted drag queen in a 20-foot headdress lip-synched the song from a dais while a small troupe of modern ballet dancers pirouetted onstage. When the song ended, the ceiling exploded with silver confetti. Watching the spectacle, Gary Steinberg beamed.
