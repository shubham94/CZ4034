Michael Bloomberg is a guy who, when asked if he had ever tried marijuana, replied: ''You bet I did. And I enjoyed it.'' (Alas, he's not willing to advocate decriminalizing the experience for the rest of us, but that's a subject for another day.) He once fondly likened his college fraternity to the one in ''Animal House,'' and he still enjoys a party. He is no libertarian, let alone libertine, but his attitude toward private pleasure is pretty much live and let live. On the subject of tobacco, though, he has surprised many constituents with his zeal. First he slapped on a city tax increase that raises the price of a pack of cigarettes to around $7. Now he proposes to outlaw smoking in every bar and restaurant in the five boroughs of New York.", "snippet": "The mayor of New York City does not seem to be a particularly puritanical man.
