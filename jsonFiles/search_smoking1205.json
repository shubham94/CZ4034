By Colette Dowling. 266 pp. New York: Summit Books. $12.95. COLETTE DOWLING has not had an easy time of it. After her divorce, she spent four difficult years establishing herself as a writer, caring for three children singlehanded and tending to a former husband who was often hospitalized for emotional illness. Then she met a man, retired to the countryside and discovered blissful domesticity. She nested. She cooked. She stopped working. She planted a garden. She slept late. She loved being taken care of. Within a few short months, she realized that she had forfeited her independence, ambition and self-respect in a headlong retreat into woman's traditional role. In ''The Cinderella Complex,'' Miss Dowling attempts to make sense of her own experience by elevating it into an entire italicized thesis: ''Personal, psychological dependency - the deep wish to be taken care of by others - is the chief force holding women down today. ... Like Cinderella, women today are still waiting for something external to transform their lives.'' Without considering what an impersonal, un-psychological dependency might be, Miss Dowling offers psychological studies, interviews with psychiatrists and the experiences of an unspecified number of women to support her view.", "snippet": "THE CINDERELLA COMPLEX Women's Hidden Fear of Independence.
