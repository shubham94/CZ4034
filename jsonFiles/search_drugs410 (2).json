When the co-founder Carly Brien's mother got ill, she and her friends Hayden Slater and Hedi Gores decided to change career paths (from public relations, production and full-time motherhood, respectively) and create something healthful and positive. At the time, Los Angeles was lacking a juicery that used a hydraulic press, a machine that squelches an entire fruit or vegetable into a pulp, extracting three to four times more than an average juicer. After yoga class one day, Slater found the perfect spot for one: a 22-square-foot broom closet adjacent to the Brentwood Country Mart. Today, Pressed is a thriving business - a second location (in a truck) opened in Malibu last summer, and at the end of last year Slater and friends brought a storefront to West Hollywood. The juicery also takes orders online and delivers nationwide to loyals who can't live without its Greens 2 (a blend of kale, spinach, romaine, parsley, cucumber, celery, apple and lemon), Detox 2 (pineapple, green apple and mint) and Almond Milk (almonds, dates, vanilla bean, sea salt and filtered water).", "headline": {"main": "Drink Up | Pressed Juicery's Chalkboard Goes Live", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "abstract": "A juice joint takes its healthy ideas to the World Wide Web.", "print_page": null, "word_count": 323, "_id": "4fd3a2298eb7c8105d8e9c62", "snippet": "A juice joint takes its healthy ideas to the World Wide Web.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/drink-up-pressed-juicerys-chalkboard-goes-live/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Sara", "lastname": "MOONVES"}], "original": "By SARA MOONVES"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2012-01-23T17:29:15Z", "section_name": "T:Style"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": null, "headline": {"main": "Corporate Rule Is Not Inevitable", "kicker": "Mark Bittman Blog"}, "abstract": "News for the week that was.", "print_page": null, "word_count": "530", "_id": "54f2f4f57988107c2577d4b9", "snippet": "News for the week that was.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://bittman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/corporate-rule-is-not-inevitable/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Mark", "lastname": "BITTMAN"}], "original": "By MARK BITTMAN"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2012-01-23T13:10:29Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": "President Obama formally rejected the Keystone XL pipeline.
