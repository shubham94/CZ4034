Their hope is that this, the first known attempt to transplant tissue into a human brain, will counter the tremors and other symptoms of that disease. If successful, the method might be applicable to some other brain disorders, such as Huntington's chorea and damage due to strokes. Although the planned treatment for Parkinsonism is untested in humans, the procedure is the fruit of eight years of research and animal experiments by the Stockholm group and its collaborators at the National Institute of Mental Health in Washington, D.C., and at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. The Americans are not participating in the experiment on a human patient. The animal tests have shown the brain to be what the experimenters call a ''privileged site'' for transplants. This is because the brain typically does not reject transplants, unlike other parts of the body, where immune defenders destroy such intrusions.", "headline": {"main": "NEW TISSUE WILL BE IMPLANTED IN BRAIN TO TREAT"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1254, "_id": "4fd11b3c8eb7c8105d5d6c3a", "snippet": "PARKINSON'S By WALTER SULLIVAN   SURGEONS in Stockholm plan soon to insert, in the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson's disease, cells taken from that person's adrenal glands.
