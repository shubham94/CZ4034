That meant checking into the red-brick building over on Lemacks Street - the Colleton Regional Hospital, the only hospital in the county. It was a dim affair. Rooms leaked when it rained. Plaster was peeling off the walls. Squadrons of roaches, mice and rats competed for space. Some of the equipment seemed fit for a museum. Well-to-do denizens simply hopped in their cars and drove to Charleston and were healed there. Then, near the end of 1980, corporate medicine came to Walterboro. And last March, a spiffy new 145-bed hospital opened its doors on Robertson Boulevard. Its proprietor is not the community, but the Hospital Corporation of America, a for-profit public company that rules over the nation's largest hospital system.", "headline": {"main": "OPERATING FOR PROFIT AT HOSPITAL CORP."}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 3523, "_id": "4fd133a38eb7c8105d603110", "snippet": "WALTERBORO, S.C., is a poor, sleepy, rural community of 6,100 peoples et about 50 miles from Charleston.

Recently, a House Appropriations subcommittee added $5 million to the 1984 budget of the Federal Trade Commission, allowing it to keep its regional offices open and strong. The House Energy and Commerce Committee roundly defeated a bid from advertisers that hoped to prevent the F.T.C. from challenging advertisements directed at young children, while passing a resolution directing the agency to begin a series of studies of the insurance industry. Yet two years ago last January, as Ronald Reagan was inaugurated President, a Harris poll indicated that a majority of American voters responded agreeably to his vow to peel Government from the backs of business. A majority, apparently without regret, also saw the consumer movement as ''running out of steam.'' Last January, Louis Harris, the poll taker, announced to the annual national Consumer Assembly in Washington that, by a 55 percent to 36 percent margin, the public now rejected ''the notion that the consumer movement has run out of steam. By a sizable and convincing 80 to 15 percent, the prevailing view of the American people is that unless they keep fighting, consumer groups may begin to lose what they have achieved.''", "headline": {"main": "THE CASE FOR CONSUMERISM"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": 3233, "_id": "4fd133a38eb7c8105d60310f", "snippet": "Today, an abundance of evidence suggests that President Reagan, by stimulating consumer reaction, has done for the consumer movement of the 1980's what the consumer advocate Ralph Nader did two decades earlier, though neither is likely to cherish the...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/29/magazine/the-case-for-consumerism.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "CONSUMER PROTECTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REGULATION AND DEREGULATION OF INDUSTRY"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Michael", "lastname": "Pertschuk"}], "original": "By Michael Pertschuk; Michael Pertschuk has been a Federal Trade Commisionersince 1977"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1983-05-29T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}], "meta": {"hits": 2, "offset": 0, "time": 37}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
