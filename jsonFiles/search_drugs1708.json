The most vulnerable parts of the lower spine, the disks, are cartilaginous pads enclosed in capsules that act as cushions between the vertebrae. Often lacking the support of strong muscles in the abdomen, back and buttocks, they may give way under severe strain. An overstressed disk does not really slip but may herniate, bulging out from between the bony segments as if it were a piece of bubble gum being blown up. Depending on where and how large the bulge is, the herniated disk may press on a nerve, causing pain that is often severe and sometimes incapacitating. The sciatic nerve, which starts in the lower spine and runs down the back of each leg, is the one usually affected.
