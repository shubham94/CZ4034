Its subject is the dangers for teenagers of sexual repression, and the dangers for their parents of lying to them about it -- quite a radical subject when you think about it, though sometimes it's hard to with the made-for-Muzak theme song swelling on the soundtrack. Molly, played by the 17-year-old Sandra Dee, of the cotton-candy hair and the candy-apple lips, willingly goes all the way with lanky, sensitive Johnny, played by Troy Donahue, of course. Defying what we think we know about the 1950's, the movie takes for granted that teenagers, even ''good'' girls, really want to have sex, sympathizes with them for it and respects both their predicament and that of good-hearted parents who don't know what to tell them. ''Is there no completely honest answer I can give her?'' agonizes Molly's loving father, who is rugged-looking and Ban-Lon-shirted in the 50's style, but sweetly emotive too. Trying ''to suffocate every natural instinct'' in the girl and make ''sex synonymous with dirt'' was wrong and cruel. His newly rediscovered old flame gives the only answer that makes any sense to him: ''You can tell her that if they experiment, they must always remember what the cost can be. You can warn her that at first it's the passions and desires that rule a girl's wants'' but that ''love is a learned thing between a man and woman.''", "headline": {"main": "The Young and The Restless", "kicker": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 6-30-02"}, "abstract": "Margaret Talbot essay says what teenagers are taught about sex these days makes it seem like dangerous, dirty business; says Judith Levine, author of book on sex education, claims this is result of increasing influence in sex education of abstinence-only ideology; holds that one cliche about sex education is that it should not send 'mixed messages'; says better approach is abstinence-plus education, in which teenagers are discouraged from rushing into sex but also given information about contraception; photos (M)", "print_page": "11", "word_count": 995, "_id": "4fd237d28eb7c8105d7cab77", "snippet": "I've always been fond of the movie ''A Summer Place,'' one of those late-50's Technicolor melodramas that can barely contain the enormous and genuine emotions it evokes.
