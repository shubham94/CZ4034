Born in Salt Lake City the son of a mine supervisor, Dr. Christopherson was an undergraduate at the University of Utah, took his M.D. from the University of Louisville in 1942 and his residency in pathology at City Hospital of Akron. He was among a pioneering cadre of young pathologists who sought specialized training in neoplastic diseases under the celebrated Dr. Fred Waldorf Stewart at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (1949-50). Returning to the University of Louisville School of Medicine, Dr. Christopherson rose to Professor and Chairman of the Department of Pathology (1956-1974) and was named Distinguished Professor in 1979. His early investigations included novel research into the tissue biology of interstitial irradiation. He went on to contribute landmark cytologic and epidemiologic studies of precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix as well as experimental cervical carcinogenesis in animal models. His efforts proved invaluable in determining the impact of cytologic screening (the ''Pap test'') on the detection of cervical cancer and ''Dr. Chris,'' as he was affectionately known, came to be justly credited for a significant role in reducing the death rate due to this disease. He provided seminal descriptions of various human cancers, most notably the study, written with Drs. Stewart and Frank Foote, establishing alveolar soft part sarcoma as a distinct entity. The recipient of numerous awards, Dr. Christopherson served as President of The American Society of Cytology, The Arthur Purdy Stout Society of Surgical Pathologists and The International Academy of Pathology. In 1971, he was made Honorary Life Member of the Board of Directors of the American Cancer Society. A dedicated mentor, Dr. Chris continued to teach until his retirement in 2001. Our condolences to his wife of 64 years, Kathryn, and entire family. He is survived, as well, by many admiring colleagues, grateful students and an incalculable number of patients whose lives his labors helped preserve. Marc K.
