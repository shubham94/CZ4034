The strain of the emphysema, in turn, severely damaged Mr. Chernenko's heart, enlarging it, causing it to fail, and finally stopping it at 7:20 P.M. Sunday, according to the report. In addition, the report said, Mr. Chernenko's liver was destroyed by two common diseases, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis.

However, he will continue his research at the laboratory, becoming once more the full-time researcher he was two decades ago, before assuming administrative responsibilities. ''Twenty years ago,'' Dr. Selikoff recalled, ''a friend and associate of mine said that the hospital was losing a very good researcher and getting only a mediocre administrator.
