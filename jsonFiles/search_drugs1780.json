So are the coffers of a largely unregulated $10-billion industry that purports to assist people in shedding unwanted pounds via drugs, devices, salons, special foods and a never-ending stream of best-selling diet schemes. While the desperate resort to such extremes as prolonged fasts, stapling the stomach, jaw wiring and intestinal bypass surgery, the majority of weight-conscious Americans hop from one fad diet to another searching vainly for a shortcut to slimness, and sometimes jeopardizing their health in the process. Yet, experts report, 80 to 90 percent of dieters soon regain lost pounds and often then some, only to try still another diet in what the nutritionist Dr. Jean Mayer has dubbed ''the rhythm method of girth control.'' ''If there was an effective diet,'' said Dr. George A. Bray of the University of California at Los Angeles, ''there would be no need for the continuous introduction of new diets: the 'Grapefruit Diet,' the 'Drinking Man's Diet,' the 'Air Force Diet,' the 'Mayo Diet,' the 'Quick Weight Loss Diet' and so on. It seems obvious from the number of diets that have been made available and are continuing to appear, none of them provides the answer to obesity.''", "headline": {"main": "THE SCIENCE OF DIETING: A FIGHT AGAINST MIND AND METABOLISM"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2653, "_id": "4fd116838eb7c8105d5cd8f3", "snippet": "DESPITE the national obsession with diets and dieting, 80 million Americans are overweight and, a recent national survey showed, the average person today is fatter than ever before.
