Behind him, rolling along a Northern California hillside, are three terraced acres of organic fig trees, plum trees, pear trees, peach trees, fraises des bois, tomatoes and melons and a bounty of edible flowers. But Klein, 47, is no farmer. A Harvard M.B.A. who made his fortune in data communications before dropping out to hang with the Grateful Dead and become an environmental advocate, he is on the well-heeled vanguard of the hottest (or, in this case, the coolest) dietary trend: raw-foodism. Cooked food has not passed Klein's lips in five years -- that means not only meat but also vegetarian staples like pasta, rice and beans, which are not tasty in their natural state. Since, like most raw-foodists, he is also vegan, he abstains from dairy and eggs. Even tofu is taboo, because the soybeans it is made from are cooked. ''I've never felt better,'' Klein says. He sleeps less, has more energy. He even eats less. Although he does a two-hour ashtanga yoga workout each morning, he subsists on about 800 calories a day, which most nutritionists would consider starvation level. (The recommended daily allowance for an active adult male is 2,900 calories.) Raw-foodists claim, however, that uncooked calories metabolize more efficiently -- although there is no evidence for this. When I suggest that vegans I've met often look sickly, he shrugs. ''What we perceive as healthy may to a certain extent be socially determined,'' he says. ''They may have been very healthy and just looked weird to you.'' Klein himself is gaunt, though his arms are enviably muscular.", "snippet": "Michael Klein sits on the garden wall dressed in bicycle shorts and a tie-dyed San Francisco Giants T-shirt, his hair pulled into a ponytail, his expression obscured by mirrored sunglasses.
