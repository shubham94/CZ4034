But it took almost no time, officials said, before she virtually disappeared into his world. $(B6.$) Year-Round Classes Weighed Mayor Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said that they would consider keeping the school system open all year to lessen overcrowding. The Mayor and Chancellor were responding to a new report suggesting that the city's finances were so shaky that there would not be enough money soon to house the growing student population. $(B1.$) A student at Bushwick High School in Brooklyn was raped in the school basement, allegedly by another student, in an incident that reignited a dispute over school security. $(B3.$) Clerical workers at Barnard College ended their five-month strike by ratifying a contract in which Barnard gave in to employee demands on health insurance. $(B4.$) No Answers Year After Death Maria Isabel Alves a saleswoman who loved running, swimming and the more mystical side of religion, was killed while jogging on a rainy morning in Central Park one year ago. As the anniversary approached, her mother found herself drawn to her daughter's untouched bedroom in Marica, Brazil, pleading with a picture of Jesus for answers. $(B1.$) Investigators are still seeking the big break they hope will lead them to the man who killed Ms Alves.
