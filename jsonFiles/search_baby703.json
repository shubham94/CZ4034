I don't recall authority figures having to explain that it was a national crisis -- even to a kid, that was pretty obvious. One of the oddest things about the impeachment weekend just before Christmas was the constant stream of reminders that the country was again experiencing such a crisis. Throughout the ordeal, legislators and commentators tried to come up with more dramatic ways to frame the events taking place. Bill Clinton was about to become only the second President ever impeached. He would be our first elected President ever impeached. All through the holidays and on into January the tone remained the same: we were having the first Senate trial of a President in 130 years. Watching TV was like having someone grab you by the lapels and shout, Don't you understand this is supposed to be historic! Bill Clinton's impeachment is historic in the sense of it being an event historians will puzzle over in decades to come. But what those historians will have to ponder is not how it shook the country, but why it didn't. They will have to explain how the country experienced the form of a constitutional crisis without the content of one, how an impeachment could drive a President's approval rating up instead of down. They may be better disposed than contemporary observers of the Clinton scandal to look beyond the Dow Jones industrial average for an explanation. For Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal represents something that is truly historic -- a break in the way the American Presidency functions.", "headline": {"main": "The Governor-President"}, "abstract": "Jacob Weisberg article assessing Pres Clinton's legacy holds Clinton has changed way in which American Presidency functions, making it possible for him to weather impeachment without shaking nation; holds heroic phase of Presidency has ended because nation is at peace and growing more prosperous; holds Clinton has downsized office, both stripping away some of its dignity and making adjustments demanded by historical moment; photos (L)", "print_page": "30", "word_count": 7234, "_id": "4fd20e048eb7c8105d77f317", "snippet": "As a 10-year-old glued to the TV through the summer of Watergate, I remember the air of gravity that hung over the proceedings, the sense that it was a dreadful necessity to put a President on trial.
