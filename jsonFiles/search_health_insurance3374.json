This is pretty much a wasted appearance, so Whitman, who is a sports nut, decides to take batting practice. Aides urge her just to throw out a pitch, executive style. Undaunted, she steps into the batter's box and hoists a Louisville Slugger. Whitman is dressed to take cuts; she favors pant suits and sensible shoes.
