Earlier this year, Hoechst, another industry leader, snapped up Rosenthal Technik, the technology arm of the Rosenthal porcelain group. At about the same time, Bayer, the third of Germany's chemical giants, announced ambitious plans to boost its drive into the United States pharmaceuticals market, including the construction of a multimillion-dollar research center near New Haven. West Germany's Big Three chemical companies - the world's three largest until 1981, when Du Pont acquired Conoco and grabbed first place by total sales - are on the move. For the last two years they have enjoyed their biggest earnings boom since the mid-1970's. And unlike their American counterparts, who are staggering under the combined burdens of the strong dollar, fierce foreign competition and weakening demand, the West German companies have money to burn. But memories of their severe slump of the early 1980's are still vivid, and the Big Three are embarking on a flurry of acquisitions at home and abroad - particularly in the United States, where their combined sales already near $8 billion.
