It is the capital of innovation, of material prosperity, of a certain kind of energy, of certain kinds of freedom and of transience. Silicon Valley is to the United States what the United States is to the rest of the world. It is one of those places, unlike the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but like Las Vegas, that is unimaginable anyplace but in the United States. It is distinctively us. Within this unusual place some people have clearly been more unusual than others. Many of those who sought and found fortune in Silicon Valley in the 1990's could just as easily have found it on Wall Street in the 1980's or in London in the 1860's. But a certain type of person who has made it big in Silicon Valley could have made it big at no other time in history. He was built to work on the frontier of economic life when the frontier was once again up for grabs. He was designed for rapid social and technological change. He was the starter of new things. Oddly enough, this character could not describe what he did for a living. When a person sets out to find the new idea that will a) make him rich, and b) throw entire industries into turmoil, and c) cause ordinary people to sit up and say, ''My God, something just changed,'' he isn't doing science. He isn't engaged in what any serious thinker would call thought. Unless he makes a lot of money he isn't even treated as a businessman, at least not by serious businessmen. He might call himself an ''entrepreneur,'' but the currency of that word has been debased. Really, there's no good word for what he does. I first noticed this problem when I watched one of these people -- a man who had made himself a billion dollars -- try to fill out a simple questionnaire. On the line that asked him to state his occupation he did not know what to write. Searcher? He couldn't very well put down that.", "headline": {"main": "The Search Engine"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "77", "word_count": 8684, "_id": "4fd2019a8eb7c8105d7664a9", "snippet": "The United States obviously occupies a strange place in the world.
