The guerrillas pose a delicate problem for NATO, particularly because of the growing political support they command from Albanians. A1 NATO slowly expanded its control over a central swath of Kosovo, pouring thousands more soldiers into major towns and villages but effectively ceding the airport in the capital to about 200 Russian soldiers. President Clinton and other senior American leaders spoke with their counterparts in Russia but were unable to resolve the impasse. A15 A British financier, acting with the knowledge of Germany and Finland, held secret talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia that appear to have helped him reconcile himself to the peace agreement, German and Swedish officials said. A15 Korean Naval Battle South Korean naval forces sank a North Korean torpedo boat today in an exchange of gunfire during a nine-day confrontation in the Yellow Sea. South Korea then put armed forces on combat-level alert. A1 Charging Spy Suspect Unlikely Federal authorities say it is unlikely that Wen Ho Lee, the scientist at the center of the suspected theft of nuclear secrets by China, will ever face criminal charges of espionage. A1 Administration initiatives to improve security at nuclear weapons laboratories are not being carried out because of bureaucratic arrogance and foot-dragging, a Presidential review panel said. A12 China Meets With Sect A senior Chinese Government official met representatives of the Buddhist Law spiritual sect to deny rumors of an imminent crackdown, but the official also sternly warned them against upsetting social stability, state television reported. A13 The Successor to Mandela South Africa's second post-apartheid Parliament was sworn in and chose Thabo Mbeki as the successor to President Nelson Mandela. With Mr. Mandela watching, Mr. Mbeki delivered his acceptance speech; he is to be inaugurated tomorrow. A3 Blair Affirms Platform Prime Minister Tony Blair said his Government would stick to its pro-European stance despite its seeming rejection by British voters electing the country's 87 members of the European Parliament. A5 Belgian Premier Resigns Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene resigned after voters swept away his center-left coalition Government in elections on Sunday. The Government had been heavily criticized for its handling of a dioxin scare that cleared poultry, beef, eggs and butter from stores. A8 NATIONAL A20-24 Court Voids Broadcast Ban On Casino Gambling Ads The Supreme Court unanimously struck down a 65-year-old ban on broadcast advertising of casino gambling, ruling on First Amendment grounds that the Federal law ''sacrifices an intolerable amount of truthful speech about lawful conduct.'' The Court focused on the irrationality of making distinctions among advertisers: gambling at Indian-owned casinos could be advertised, but not at Atlantic City casinos. The Court suggested that a more uniform and ''coherent'' policy of advertising restrictions might be upheld. That left the door open for the Court to uphold restrictions on the advertising of other lawful products, like tobacco. A1 The Court agreed to decide if public schools can provide computers and other ''instructional equipment'' for use in religious schools. A22 Gun Issues Spilt From Crime Bill House Republican leaders separated gun-control proposals from broader juvenile-crime legislation and put the gun measures in their own, distinct bill. Republicans said they were trying to make sure that new restrictions on firearms had a fair chance of passing the House. Democrats said it was really a tactic to try to insure the failure of gun control. A24 New Tack on Clean-Air Rules The E.P.A., stymied by two court rulings setting aside clean-air standards, said it had a new way to force power plants in 12 states to cut pollutants that contribute to smog in the Northeast. The approach relies on petitions brought by four states saying that no matter what they did within their borders they could not meet older smog standards, because too much pollution blew in from other states. The utility and coal industries, which won the last round in court, said they would file legal challenges to the new E.P.A. tactic. A24 Cloning Effort Denied The Geron Corporation, which has sponsored the leading research on primordial human cells, said it was conducting research on discarded human embryos in the hope of learning how to convert the ordinary cells of a patient into stem cells, which can be used for self-repair. The company denied a published report that it was trying to create cloned human embryos and said it had no intention of doing so. A21 NEW YORK/REGION B1-16 Jury Orders City to Pay $76 Million to Injured Child A Manhattan jury has ordered the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation to pay $76.4 million to a 12-year-old girl who sustained brain damage during her birth at Harlem Hospital Center. A defense lawyer said the city would seek to have the verdict set aside as ''grossly excessive.'' B1 Opposition to Abortion Bill NOW and abortion rights groups gathered at the New Jersey State House for their first demonstration against a measure that would require teen-age girls to notify their parents before getting an abortion. The groups said they had been caught off guard by Governor Whitman's support of the bill. The Assembly passed it last week, and yesterday a Senate panel approved it, 5 to 2. B5 Dispute Over Lead Paint Bill A City Council rift widened over a bill that would clarify and strengthen a law to protect children from poisoning caused by lead paint. B5 Tracking the M15 From Space New York City Transit said it would begin using satellites to track buses on six Manhattan routes this fall. It also confirmed delays in the overhaul of some subway stations. B5 SCIENCE TIMES F1-14 Timing and Pregnancy Researchers said fertilized eggs need to implant themselves in the uterus 8 to 10 days after ovulation, and that the later an egg implanted itself, the greater the chance that a pregnancy would fail. F10 Health & Fitness F7 OBITUARIES B14 SPORTS D1-8 Surgery for Astros Manager Larry Dierker, 52, will undergo brain surgery today to remove a mass of malformed blood vessels that caused a seizure in the Houston dugout.

C1 Nasdaq Looks to Japan The National Association of Securities Dealers is expected to announce today that it will form an electronic trading system similar to its Nasdaq market to trade Japanese stocks. C1 Some Caution on Technology Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, cautioned against counting on technology as a miracle cure for inflation or a rationale for ever-higher stock prices. He did not address the growing consensus that the central bank would soon raise interest rates.
