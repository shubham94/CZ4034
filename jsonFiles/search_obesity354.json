(Discovery, Animal Planet) LIFEOprah Winfrey narrates this 11-part nature series, which explores the adaptability and diversity of life on earth -- culling among the 30 million or so animal and plant species here -- from the spectacular to the downright bizarre. Images were captured in high definition using equipment like a ''yogi cam,'' which can track smoothly alongside migrating reindeer and elephants, and an intricate cable rigging that enabled crews to ''fly'' a camera through thousands of monarch butterflies. The survey begins with ''Challenges of Life,'' which explores survival strategies like those of the stalk-eyed fly, which inflates its head to impress females; Kenyan cheetahs who band together to hunt large prey; and monkeys in Brazil that use tools resembling a hammer and anvil to crack nuts. ''Reptiles and Amphibians,'' at 9, shows a pebble toad escaping a tarantula by bouncing down a rock face; a basilisk lizard running on water; a chameleon snatching its prey with its tongue; and the savage hunting techniques of the Komodo dragon.
