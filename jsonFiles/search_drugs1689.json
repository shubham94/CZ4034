Because doctors thought she was ''hooked on the needle,'' sometimes claiming relief even before the hypodermic was withdrawn, the attending physician ordered a nurse to give her a placebo. The nurse refused because she felt it was unethical to deceive the patient. So another nurse, who agreed with doctors that the cure justified the lie, injected the woman with three cubic centimeters of saline solution. Minutes later the patient went home, saying she felt much better. ''I don't feel guilty, it wasn't malicious,'' the nurse who administered the saline shot said in an interview. ''We ruled out organic causes of her pain. It is one of the tools of medicine.''", "headline": {"main": "VALUE OF THE PLACEBO BEING ARGUED ON ETHICAL GROUNDS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": 1434, "_id": "4fd12c1a8eb7c8105d5f6272", "snippet": "A woman who is a frequent patient at the Shands Teaching Hospital in Gainesville, Fla., recently returned to the emergency room and asked for drugs to alleviate chronic pain in her hip.

First, I am determined that this budget will keep faith with the people of Connecticut and meet their real needs. We have a proud heritage in this state of caring and commitment, and of being leaders for the nation. I do not intend ignore that heritage. I believe the people of Connecticut expect and demand strong leadership, especially during difficult times. This administration will honor its commitment to the social contract with our people. To meet these needs, my second guideline was the work of the Bipartisan Commission on State Tax Revenue and Related Fiscal Policy. I am recommending a general-fund budget of $3.552 billion, an increase of $320.5 million, or 9.9 percent, over this year's estimated spending. This is a cut of more than $200 million from the amount I began working with nearly three months ago.", "headline": {"main": "EXCERPTS FROM ADDRESS ON CONNECTICUT BUDGET"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": 1529, "_id": "4fd12a1d8eb7c8105d5f22f1", "snippet": "Following are excerpts from Gov.
