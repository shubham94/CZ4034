They want their kids to be in a safe place with a warm, attentive care giver who can communicate with them about their children. And whatever other differences there are among Americans, their hopes for their children converge. \"There is an amazing consensus on what quality is,\" said Ellen Galinsky, copresident of the Families and Work Institute in New York and one of the authors of a new study of home-based child care. \"It cuts across all ethnic and income lines.\" Ms. Galinksy and her colleagues, Carollee Howes, Susan Kontos and Marybeth Shinn, studied in-home child care arrangements in communities in Southern California, Texas and North Carolina. The arrangements included care offered in the homes of nonfamily providers, the most prevalent form of care for children under 5, and care offered by relatives. A third of families with a working mother use in-home care; 13 percent of in-home providers are related to their charges.", "headline": {"main": "At Work; Searching for Quality in Child Care"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "29", "word_count": 782, "_id": "4fd1e2cf8eb7c8105d72b9c2", "snippet": "EXPERTS, politicians and Rush Limbaugh may debate about family values and what's good for children, but parents who put their kids in day care have a pretty solid set of undebatable expectations.
