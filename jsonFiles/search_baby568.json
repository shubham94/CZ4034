Mexico's hopes for Fox were extraordinary, but new presidents nearly everywhere assume their nations' leadership with the expectation that they will clean up graft of some kind -- usually because they have promised it. Perhaps candidates in Finland, the world's least corrupt nation, don't tend to run on an anticorruption platform, but they do in most other nations, and not just poor or authoritarian ones.
