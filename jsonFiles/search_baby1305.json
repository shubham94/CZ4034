By Lucinda Franks It is a warm August night in Ann Arbor, Mich., in l970. The house I have come to visit looks like so many other houses built for the returning heros of World War II: a rambling split-level, with a flagstone path that leads to the front door. Beyond that door, however, the lighting is dim, mattresses are scattered about on the dusty floor. The smells are reminiscent of a bazaar: overripe fruit, marijuana, baby formula, gasoline from freshly mixed Molotov cocktails that are lined up on the bookshelves like soda pop in a grocery. Men, women and children wander about the rooms as aimlessly as house cats. They eat when hungry, sleep when tired. On this night, however, two of the men have a purpose. They have backed me so close against the wall that I can count the whiskers in their beards. To my right and to my left is a photo gallery of F.B.I. agents and policemen across whose faces have been scrawled: ''Off the pigs. ... Mash the pigs. ... Stick the pigs.''", "headline": {"main": "THE SEEDS OF TERROR"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "35", "word_count": 6543, "_id": "4fd117d48eb7c8105d5cf3fa", "snippet": "Lucinda Franks, a freelance writer and former Times reporter, covered the antiwar movement and won the l971 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting for a series written with Thomas Powers for United Press International.
