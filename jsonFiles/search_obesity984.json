Browse the shelves: along with the ingredients for Southern staples like corn bread and fried chicken stretches a range of pig parts from head to foot, including brains and fatty ham hocks and tails. Pork chitlins for frying are available in 10-pound buckets; fatback by the slab. Fatty beef parts are popular, too. Lard flies off the shelves in eight-pound cans. It is not surprising that heart disease, high-blood pressure, diabetes and obesity are common here. The diet dates to pre-Civil War days. The ancestors of many residents were slaves on Alabama's cotton plantations. For the town's 1,730 residents, there are three doctors, no hospitals, no ambulances, no 911 service. The population is 79 percent African-American; the jobless rate is edging toward 14 percent.
