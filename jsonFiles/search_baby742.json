The family, along with the goat, huddled on a single vermin-infested straw mat. Not that kings and queens in gloomy castles had it much better. Privacy was nonexistent, and the nobility, one historian has written, ''didn't so much live in their houses as camp in them.'' They spent most of their time on the road, visiting far-flung estates.
