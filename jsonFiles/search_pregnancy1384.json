Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show. Museums * ANNI ALBERS, Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Aug. 20). This survey of arguably the most influential textile artist of the 20th century is part retrospective, part weaving seminar, part biography -- and altogether fascinating. It traces the development of Albers's work from her student days at the Bauhaus to Black Mountain College, where she taught with her husband, Josef. It contrasts her designs for commercial fabrics, which emphasized structure and materials in new ways, with her pictorially striking hand-loomed pieces. A gallery of photographs, letters, personal memorabilia and pre-Columbian textile fragments she collected reflects her character and quietly glamorous personal style. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50, students and senior citizens; free for children under 12 (Roberta Smith).", "headline": {"main": "ART GUIDE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "36", "word_count": 4405, "_id": "4fd1fa7f8eb7c8105d7585ea", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend.
