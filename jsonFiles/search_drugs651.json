Their youngest children, a giddy pair of elementary-schoolers, rushed in and out of the room. Their teenage daughter chattered about her ''cheerleading skills.'' Even the 17-year-old Deen made an appearance, slouching up from the basement to pick at leftovers from dinner. It seemed a storybook image of the American immigrant dream. But across the room, in low voices so the kids couldn't hear, Kaprr spoke about the circumstances threatening to break up his family. Kaprr and Titia have been living in the United States for 13 years. By the time they moved into this house five years ago, they had legal status, steady jobs, a growing family, night-school degrees well under way and a mortgage. Despite appearances, though, Kaprr and Titia are not Americans, or even on a certain path to citizenship. Rather, they are among at least 2,700 Sierra Leoneans living and working legally across the United States who face deportation unless they leave the country by May 3.", "headline": {"main": "The Way We Live Now: 5-2-04: Phenomenon; Exit Date"}, "abstract": "Douglas McGray article on family of illegal immigrants from Sierra Leone who face deportation; in 1997, US granted all Sierra Leoneans living within its borders temporary protection status, designed to protect refugees who cannot benefit from asylum laws; status grants right to work and live in US legally but not citizenship and is renewable annually depending on crisis in country of origin; temporary status is ending for Sierra Leonians and, with three children born in US who are citizens, family is mired in complex and uncertain situation; photo (L)", "print_page": "26", "word_count": 3066, "_id": "4fd23aa28eb7c8105d7cf267", "snippet": "On a snowy January evening, in the kitchen of a powder blue colonial at the end of a still, winding block in the suburbs of Washington, Titia and her husband, Kaprr, two immigrants from Sierra Leone, enjoyed a rare family evening together.
