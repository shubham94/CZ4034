But nationwide, private insurers reimburse only about half of what hospitals charge them. That's because many hospitals have prenegotiated contracts with insurers to establish a discounted rate of payment. And those rates vary wildly -- one carrier may reimburse 30 percent; another, 60 percent. The effect, analysts say, is that hospitals spike their prices so they can offer insurers a better-looking deal, without losing money. ''We have a gigantic system of trying to get someone else to pay the bill,'' says Stuart Altman, professor of national health policy at Brandeis. ''It's called cost-shifting. And hospitals are always trying to find pockets that will get them the profits they need.'' Dawn MacKeen The Economics of Recovery The $1,000 the hospital charged for the one hour this bunion-toe surgery patient spent in the recovery room reflects not just the cost of the bed but also many other expenses, including the recent $40 increase in the price of a pint of blood, an uptick in emergency-room admissions at a time when there are fewer and fewer community hospitals and rising wages for nurses. ''Part of what is in everybody's bill is the capacity of the hospital to be open seven days a week,'' says Carmela Coyle, senior vice president for policy at the American Hospital Association.

In between is a 12-hour shift at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn. Scott, a 34-year-old specialist in emergency medicine, has worked at Kings County since 1998. Because Kings County is a publicly financed hospital in a low-income neighborhood, many who come in are uninsured, but the hospital is obliged to treat them. Which means that Scott sees a wider range of cases than doctors in most E.R.'s. In addition to dealing with cuts and bullet wounds, on any given night Scott will treat everything from miscarriages and S.T.D.'s to dental problems and what one patient believed was sleep disturbance caused by a spell. The work is exhausting, but Scott has turned down cushier offers outside the city. ''I like taking care of uninsured patients,'' she says. ''My experience in more private settings is that the patients are maybe overeducated. They pick up a Cosmo magazine and it tells them that Xanax is good for them, and then you have to explain to them why you don't want to give them Xanax. Patients here, they're pretty grateful.'' Scott, who grew up in Louisiana, also recently started a rape crisis center at the hospital and spends part of her vacation each year in Haiti, teaching medicine in Port-au-Prince and treating patients in the countryside. She came to Kings County, she says, ''because New York City emergency medicine sounded glamorous at the time.''
