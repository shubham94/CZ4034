THE timing and contents of meals, as well as the consumption of certain individual nutrients, can have subtle and occasionally dramatic effects on mood and behavior, according to a series of new studies described at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last week. Several of the studies indicate that foods and nutrients might be used therapeutically to treat such common problems as depression, insomnia, hyperactivity, chronic pain and carbohydrate cravings. The evidence presented, which shows that specific foods and nutrients can produce specific changes in the chemical balance of the brain, also suggests that diet might be tailored to suit the task at hand. For example, the research indicates, it might be best to consume a high-protein, low-carbohydrate meal before doing a complicated job that requires concentration and alertness.", "headline": {"main": "HOW DIET CAN AFFECT MOOD AND BEHAVIOR"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1393, "_id": "4fd129148eb7c8105d5f07f2", "snippet": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

The news was that one buffered aspirin a day more than halved the incidence of both fatal and nonfatal heart attacks among a group of men suffering from a condition called unstable angina. The findings, which derived from a study of 1,338 men, added to a growing body of evidence suggesting that aspirin helps prevent a number of disorders, heart and circulatory problems among them. Angina is a painful heart disorder that affects two million Americans. Unstable angina is a phrase doctors use when there is a change in the severity or character of the pain and the frequency of the attacks. Unstable angina can develop into a heart attack at any time. The buffered aspirin was taken in the form of Alka Seltzer. Data from previous studies have not agreed about aspirin's value in preventing heart attacks. However, some of those studies have been faulted for methodological reasons.", "headline": {"main": "THE DOCTOR'S WORLD"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 1219, "_id": "4fd12b7d8eb7c8105d5f4a76", "snippet": "There was news at a meeting of the American Heart Association today, but it was only part of the story.
