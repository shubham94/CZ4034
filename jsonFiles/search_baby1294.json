Babb, the deputy assistant administrator for food and nutrition, had threatened to resign if the United States voted against the code. ''There are still a few hours left to change the vote,'' Dr. Joseph said, alluding to the final vote by the full session of the World Health Assembly, scheduled for today. ''But no matter what happens, our resignations stand irrevocably. The vote was unconscionable.

The leaders of Israel and Syria exchanged sharp public criticism of each other's policies, but both said Philip C.
