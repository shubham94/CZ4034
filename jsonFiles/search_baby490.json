{"status": "OK", "response": {"docs": [{"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Although he bristles at the title -- his expression hardens, and his face starts to resemble a cloudy day with thunder threatening -- Jim Jarmusch is the last major truly independent film director in America. This is not a statement about his sensibility, although it is true that his minimalist cinematic style and his ability to deftly cross-pollinate pop culture, Eastern philosophy and classic movie genres have made him a unique presence in film for the past 20 years. While other directors may be hailed for their originality and independent point of view, Jarmusch, unlike Quentin Tarantino or pretty much any other auteur, has never made a film under a studio's watch. Ever since his debut feature, ''Stranger Than Paradise,'' in 1984, which cost $150,000, grossed $2.5 million in North America, won the Camera d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and permanently upended the idea of independent film as an intrinsically inaccessible avant-garde form, he has owned and controlled all of his movies. Nearly always, if a filmmaker's first, independent effort meets with either box-office or critical success (or both), he will be seduced into the studio system, where financing is provided in exchange for some measure of creative freedom. But despite Jarmusch's early star-is-born success and many offers from Hollywood, he has remained stubbornly distanced from the studios and their deep pockets.", "headline": {"main": "The Last Of The Indies"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "word_count": 4584, "_id": "4fd25c828eb7c8105d80a456", "snippet": "Jim Jarmusch, the paradigmatic outsider filmmaker, is about to release his most mainstream movie to date.

On the verge of retirement, an English teacher reflects on what might have been in Dan O'Brien's new play (1:40). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212)246-4422.

Nathan Lane and Marian Seldes star in a new Terrence McNally play about a couple who want to buy a theater in upstate New York (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. 'JOY' Previews start Sunday. Opens Aug. 14. Formerly titled ''The Joy of Gay Sex,'' John Fisher's romantic comedy, which received its New York premiere earlier this year, follows a group of college friends over the course of one eventful year in San Francisco (2:00).

Has the prospect of the end of the ''Star Wars'' series sent you into a deep, dark depression? Cheer up with Charles Ross's light-speed spin through the original three movies (you know, the good ones), in which he plays all the parts, including the ships (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. Broadway 'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley) 'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300.(Charles Isherwood) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley) * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schreiber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) *'PRIMO' In his crystalline adaptation of ''If This Is a Man,'' Primo Levi's memoir of the Holocaust, Antony Sher creates a portrait in which brutal memory penetrates the very marrow of existence. His great accomplishment is in doing so in an expressly theatrical language that never sensationalizes, lectures or begs for pity (1:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) *'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty at Dodger Stages is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder) 'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' This parody of the pompous 1980's movie has a weak script and a game Corey Feldman in the Michael Douglas role. But unlike the bunny, which is indeed boiled, it never cooks (1:10). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger) 'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson) *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz is himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Isherwood) 'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful and funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful emotional crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood) 'THE SKIN GAME' A powerful performance by James Gale propels the Mint Theater's revival of ''The Skin Game.'' The Nobel laureate John Galsworthy's drama about two English families whose differences escalate into destructive conflict provides provocative and entertaining theater (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Van Gelder) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder) *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman) *'WALK TWO MOONS' Theaterworks/NYC, the new, ''stationary'' arm of the traveling group Theaterworks/USA, starts things off with an appealing adaptation of the tweener novel by Sharon Creech, a Newbery Medal winner. A 13-year-old girl travels cross-country with her nutty grandparents in search of her mother, telling a tallish tale about her friend Phoebe along the way, to hilarious effect (1:10). Lortel, 121 Christopher Street, (212)279-4200. (Genzlinger) Off Off Broadway * 'BUSTED JESUS COMIX' Based on the story of the only cartoonist ever to be tried and convicted of obscenity, this nicely performed 65-minute satire belongs to a rich dramatic tradition of turning dirty-minded artists into First Amendment heroes. David Johnston's script touches on the trial and fills out an invented biography that gives the play a satisfying arc. Access Theater , 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. (Zinoman) 'THE GUT GIRLS' Like the large unwieldy carcass the Victorian-era characters must tackle in a slaughterhouse, this preachy British play by Sarah Daniels doesn't yield to either the director or the dialect coach in this revival, though several actresses manage to surmount the obstacles in a fashion (2:45). Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212)868-4444. (Stevens) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley) 'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101, closing tomorrow. (Brantley) 'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Brantley) 'TOP TEN' Peter Gil-Sheridan's ''Top Ten'' is a paint-by-numbers series of stereotypes. The cardboard characters and predictable permutations are, in fact, numbered. Each vignette is presented as a sort of plot equation that never really adds up. This theatrical lottery, lasting more than two hours, may soon make you feel in need of a remedial math course. ''Top Ten'' is even less than the sum of its parts. Sanford Meisner Theater, 164 11th Avenue, near 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. *'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of the 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Manohla Dargis) *'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis) *'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis) 'THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY' (R, 125 minutes, in English and Vietnamese) A young man leaves Vietnam hoping to find his father, an American soldier. Earnest and sometimes clumsy, but also affecting. (A.O. Scott) 'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director, Nora Ephron, forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis) * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden) 'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott) 'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger also stars. (Dargis) 'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collides, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott) 'CR\u00d3NICAS' (R, 98 minutes, in Spanish and English) John Leguizamo is an ambitious, unscrupulous Miami reporter for a tabloid television show on the track of a serial murderer of children in an Ecuadorian village. (Holden) 'DARK WATER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Make that dark, stagnant water.(Dargis) 'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott) *'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry.(Dargis) * 'HAPPY ENDINGS' (R, 130 minutes) An ensemble piece about a miscellany of Angelenos bumping against one another with love and in anger, Don Roos's slyly subversive new movie is a drama disguised as a wisp of a comedy, and a road map to the way we live now. With Lisa Kudrow and the sublime Maggie Gyllenhaal. (Dargis) 'HERBIE: FULLY LOADED' (G, 95 minutes) ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' is a perfectly silly movie for a silly season that in recent years has forgotten how to be this silly. Lindsay Lohan, who combines a tomboyish spunk with a sexy, head-turning strut, gives it a charismatic star boost. (Holden) 'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott) *'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott) 'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott) 'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott) 'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden) *'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is, in many ways, less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation and about how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis) 'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo, expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott) 'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott) 'MAKING GRACE' (No rating, 86 minutes) An intimate documentary focusing on a 30-something lesbian couple who want to become parents, this is the kind of film rarely seen by those who would benefit most from its universal message.(Jeannette Catsoulis) *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden) 'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis) 'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden) *'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of the exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden) * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott) '9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex, are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden) 'NOVEMBER' (R, 89 minutes) The twisty paranoid thriller about a photographer's survivor's guilt and repressed memory in the wake of her boyfriend's murder is a surreal cinematic mind-tickler with not much behind its clever facade. (Holden) * 'SARABAND' (R, 107, in Swedish) Ingmar Bergman has called his bleak, unbendingly severe made-for-television epilogue to ''Scenes From a Marriage'' his final statement on film. As you watch his swan song, which stars Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as the embattled ex-spouses, you feel the crushing weight of time pressing in around them. (Holden) *'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott) ' WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott) 'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, who love the ladies, but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis) Film Series 'THE CONFORMIST' (through Aug. 11). Film Forum is screening a new 35-millimeter print of Bernardo Bertolucci's 1970 masterpiece about sex and politics in pre-World War II Italy. Jean-Louis Trintignant stars as a young Fascist assigned to assassinate his onetime mentor in Paris. 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212)727-8110; $10. (Anita Gates) 'DIVAS!' (through Aug. 30). This summer festival, presented by Thalia Film Classics, honors great women in classical movies, with dramas this weekend about movie actresses in doomed relationships. Judy Garland stars in the 1954 ''A Star Is Born,'' about a celebrity whose husband (James Mason) is destroyed by her outshining him. And in ''Sunset Boulevard'' (1950), Gloria Swanson plays a has-been silent-screen star who passionately befriends an aspiring young screenwriter (William Holden). Both films play tomorrow and Tuesday. Leonard Nimoy Thalia, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-1414, $10. (Gates) 'IN DEPPTH' (through Sunday) BAM Cin\u00e9matek concludes its 11-film, three-week retrospective of Johnny Depp's films this weekend. Lasse Hallstrom's ''What's Eating Gilbert Grape?'' (1993), about a small-town Iowa family with multiple problems, is being shown today. Tomorrow and Sunday, the feature is Jim Jarmusch's anti-western ''Dead Man'' (1995), in which Mr. Depp plays a 19th-century accountant not long for this world. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)777-3456 or (718)636-4100, $10. (Gates) ERNST LUBITSCH FILM FESTIVAL (through Aug. 6). Makor, a program of the 92nd Street Y, is screening five films by Lubitsch (1892-1947) on consecutive Saturdays. Tomorrow's feature is ''Ninotchka'' (1939), starring Greta Garbo as a stern Soviet functionary in Paris, tempted by capitalist luxuries and romance. 35 West 67th Street, (212)601-1000, $9. (Gates) RAOUL WALSH RETROSPECTIVE (through Aug. 14). The Museum of the Moving Image's 23-film tribute to Walsh (1887-1980) continues tomorrow with ''They Died With Their Boots On'' (1941), starring Errol Flynn as George Armstrong Custer. ''Desperate Journey'' (1942), a war movie with Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan, plays on Sunday. ''High Sierra'' (1941), a gangster film noir with Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino, will be shown on Saturday and Sunday. 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)-784-0077, $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AFRICAN FESTIVAL WITH THOMAS MAPFUMO AND THE BLACKS UNLIMITED, MARIA DE BARROS AND OTHERS (Sunday) A musical pioneer, the Zimbabwean Thomas Mapfumo made music for the revolutionaries who unseated the white-ruled Rhodesian government. His music transferred the brisk patterns of thumb piano to guitar; the words sometimes sent coded messages. The best-known music from Cape Verde is the lilting and pensive morna. Maria de Barros sings some mornas, but also sings other Cape Verdean styles -- including bright, driving funanas -- about love, tradition and women's strength. Gokh-Bi System, Kakande and Alain Nkossi Konda also play. 2 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, free. (Jon Pareles) BABY DAYLINER, GREG GARING, GRANT HART (Tonight) Baby Dayliner is the stage name of Ethan Marunas, a keyboard-driven one-man band. He sets up percolating electropop patterns to back neo-cabaret songs that can be droll and cynical or stylishly heartsick. Greg Garing is a songwriter who prizes both the heart-on-sleeve simplicity of honky-tonk and the possibilities of electronica. Grant Hart played pop melodic foil to the more angular Bob Mould in the seminal post-punk band H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Pareles) BANG ON A CAN (Tuesday) Members of the forward-thinking chamber-music group Bang on a Can All-Stars play a gig with visiting Uzbek musicians. Bang on a Can performers include the percussionist David Cossin, the guitarist Mark Stewart, the cellist Wendy Sutter and the bassist Gregg August. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503, $10. (Laura Sinagra) BRIAN JONESTOWN MASSACRE (Tomorrow, Sunday and Tuesday) This band's frontman Anton Newcombe resembles the Rolling Stones' washout genius Brian Jones in both his love for wan 1960's psychedelics and his flirtatious relationship with reality. The 2004 rock documentary ''Dig!'' showcases his mix of retro integrity and epic narcissism. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15 to $17. Tuesday at 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $12 (sold out). (Sinagra) *THE CASTLE FESTIVAL: WELCOMING THE WORLD FOR 150 YEARS (Sunday) Some 74 million Americans had ancestors who passed through the Castle Garden Immigrant Depot in Battery Park. This concert celebrating its 150th anniversary is a showcase for some of the music and ideas immigrants have brought to the city, with hard-charging salsa by the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, modal Middle-Eastern jazz from Simon Shaheen's Qantara, Irish immigration songs sung by Susan McKeown, African dance by the group Kotchegna, and Albanian traditional and pop songs from Merita Halili and the accordion-powered Raif Hyseni Orchestra. 4:30 to 10 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, www.thebattery.org, free. (Pareles) CROSBY, STILLS AND NASH (Monday and Tuesday) Self-satisfied baby-boom nostalgia and close high harmonies that may be more or less in tune. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070, $40 to $100. (Pareles) DEAD MEADOW (Thursday) Dead Meadow plays hard rock that evokes rolling expanse the way the blues-metal the group loves once evoked misty Gothic castles. This monstrously riff-heavy band's punk roots give its grandeur a humane warmth. 9 p.m., Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $10. (Sinagra) DESTINY'S CHILD, AMERIE (Tonight and tomorrow) The R&B diva Beyonc\u00e9 can seem a bit strident in her pursuit of media-blessed perfection, but her urgent, flexible voice is certainly that of a superstar. This concert is supposedly the swan song of the trio known for hits like the sublime heartbreaker ''Say My Name'' and the prematurely hardened ''Survivor.'' The opener, Amerie, matches the constantly climaxing track of her radio hit ''One Thing'' with gutsy assertion. Tonight at 8, Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741, $55 to $100. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631)888-9000, $39.50 to $92. (Sinagra) THE DIRTBOMBS, TRALALA (Tonight) The Detroit garage rocker Mick Collins's raw outfit, the Dirtbombs, tears through its live sets, unafraid of dissonance and rough edges. Mr. Collins has a more resonant voice than some of his shouty contemporaries. Local bubblegum rock experiment Tralala tops insistent guitar surge with lackadaisical girl-group vocals. 9 p.m., Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $15. (Sinagra) DAVE MATTHEWS BAND, BARENAKED LADIES, BLACK EYED PEAS, JEM, MIKE DOUGHTY AND OTHERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This outdoor lineup should please anybody looking for a noodle-dance vibe without too many extended solos. Dave Matthews still traffics in everyman erotics, while the Black-Eyed Peas play cultural ambassadors to the hip-hop-deprived. The British sprite Jem writes and sings upbeat trip-pop, and the Soul Coughing frontman Mike Doughty spews half-baked urban poetry. Other acts include Randolph and the Family Band and Ray Lamontagne.Noon, Randall's Island Golf Center, 1 Randalls Island, (212)427-5689, $55 to $62 (tomorrow's show sold out). (Sinagra) DURAN DURAN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Still looking good in white suits after all these years, the new-wave band that gave us hits like ''Hungry Like the Wolf'' puts on a vigorous live show. 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $75. Sunday at 8 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $75.(Sinagra) EXTRA ACTION MARCHING BAND, OXFORD COLLAPSE, TALL FIRS, ONEIDA (Tomorrow) The anarchic San Francisco Extra Action Marching Band began as a ''procession band'' for the raucousCrash Worship. As of late, the core group, with its horns, drum corps and shimmying dancers, has played dates with David Byrne. The local trio Oxford Collapse offers shaggy art-rock that recalls acerbic mid-American forbears like the Embarrassment. Tall Firs and Oneida also play. 2 p.m., East River Amphitheater, East River Park, the Lower East Side, www.eastrivermusicproject.com, free. (Sinagra) DAVID GRAY (Tuesday) Mr. Gray's voice has a sharp, nervous quaver that keeps him sounding frayed and unpretty. He sings about tears and flames, seashores and rainy nights, strumming an acoustic guitar over his band's syncopated vamps; he owes a lot to Van Morrison. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 at the door (sold out). (Pareles) JIM AND JENNIE AND THE PINETOPS (Wednesday) Unlike a lot of younger alt-country bands that nod to classic traditions, this Pennsylvania group actually plays accomplished bluegrass topped by high, lonesome close-harmonic vocals. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8778, $15. (Sinagra) LAMC INDIE SHOWDOWN (Wednesday) The Latin Alternative Music Conference (www.latinalternative.com), an annual showcase for the wildly eclectic world of Latin rock, presents eight bands from the United States and points south: Pacha, Popvert, Cuban Cowboys, Orixa, Soniko, Santos de Los Angeles and Delux. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $5. (Pareles) *LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES (Thursday) Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, latch on to dance grooves from the last three decades: James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960's boogaloo, 1970's Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rapping, while the lyrics (in Spanish) are come-ons somewhere between charm and smarm. 6 to 9 p.m., El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem. As part of the Latin Alternative Music Conference (www.latinalternative.com), it's a free concert. (Pareles) MC5 (Tonight) These working-class Detroit toughs played scab-picking, drug-dabbling proto-punk rock amid the hippie era. The original members Michael Davis, Dennis Thompson and the long-winded raconteur guitarist Wayne Kramer reunite to perform their album, ''Kick Out the Jams'' (Elektra), in its uncensored entirety. The band also plays tomorrow with the Sun Ra Arkestra at Central Park SummerStage (see Sun Ra below). 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $25. (Sinagra) O'JAYS (Monday) The O'Jays were the flagship group of the Philadelphia soul producers Gamble and Huff, dealing with hard times in songs like ''Backstabbers'' and ''For the Love of Money'' and hoping for better ones with ''Love Train.'' 7:30 p.m., Wingate Field, Winthrop Street, between Brooklyn and Kingston Avenues, Brooklyn, (718)469-1912, free. (Pareles) OLIVIA TREMOR CONTROL (Tuesday and Wednesday) One of the bands central to the Athens, Ga., collective Elephant 6, which flourished in the mid-90's indie underground, Olivia Tremor Control melded Beatlesesque melodies and Mersey beat bounce with loopy, slacker flophouse psychedelia. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15; $17 at the door. (Sinagra) LIZ PHAIR (Monday and Tuesday) This singer-songwriter, beloved for her early, sexy lo-fi missives, has caught flack for attempts at universal pop reach. But to her credit, her dirty-30's quirkiness shone through the slick production on her last effort. A new album, ''Somebody's Miracle'' (Capitol), is supposedly more elemental. Monday at 7 p.m. and Tuesday at 9 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8777, $25. (Sinagra) RONNIE SPECTOR AND THE UPTOWN HORNS (Wednesday) Ronnie Spector's gutsy, fervently out-of-tune voice made ''Be My Baby'' an indelible plea and a touchstone for New York (and New Jersey) rock ever since. 7 p.m., Hudson River Festival, Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, www.hudsonriverfestival.com, free. (Pareles) SATANICIDE (Tonight) Hailing from New Jersey, this longstanding band plays a highly ironic though no doubt culturally committed version of heavy metal that bows before the alter of Black Sabbath and AC/DC. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15; $17 at the door. (Sinagra) PATTI SMITH (Thursday) As resolutely pretentious as ever, the punk poet rocker Patti Smith still has the sinewy swagger to trump young imitators like Eleanor Friedberger of the Fiery Furnaces. Hip kids can come see the real thing howl classics like ''Gloria'' and declaim topical rants like ''Radio Baghdad.'' 7:30 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777, free. (Sinagra) RATT, QUIET RIOT, CINDERELLA, FIREHOUSE (Tomorrow) This bill includes four prominent 1980's hair metal bands. To the pop canon, Ratt contributed the vibrant and enduring ''Round and Round,'' while Quiet Riot has the distinction of writing the thuddingly irritating, yet also enduring ''Cum on Feel the Noize.'' 7 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516)334-0800, $51.50. (Sinagra) STRINGS, DEGA (Tonight) The guitar trio Strings plays a flamenco-inflected brand of Haitian troubadour music, a traditional caf\u00e9 style featuring guitar, conga, maraca and box-like marimboula bass. Dega plays konpa, another Haitian style derived from meringue but goosed with voodoo rhythms. Midnight and 2 a.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $22 to $25. (Sinagra) SUN-RA ARKESTRA, MC5, DJ SPOOKY (Tomorrow) The alto saxophonist Marshall Allen carries on the tradition of the legendary jazz bandleader Sun Ra, directing the ensemble of players young and old in a program that seamlessly mixes swing, skronk and squeal. The Detroit legends MC5 (see above) and the cerebral DJ Spooky also perform. 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777, free. (Sinagra) JAMES BLOOD ULMER (Thursday) The guitarist James Blood Ulmer made his name in jazz groups led by Art Blakey and Ornette Coleman, but he has deep roots in swampy, raucous blues. Singing in grizzled tones, plunking out notes with a thumb or making his guitar blurt feedback, he's in touch with both Son House and Jimi Hendrix. Noon, BAM's R&B Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, Downtown Brooklyn, free. (Pareles) WHITE OUT WITH JIM O'ROURKE AND THURSTON MOORE (Tomorrow) Lin Culbertson and Tom Surgal, of the experimental group White Out, make experimental rock with analog synthesizers, autoharp, flute, drums, gongs, chains and the like. They are joined by two regular co-conspirators, the ubiquitous post-rock jack of all trades Jim O'Rourke and Thurston Moore, whose sonic youth has morphed into questing, noisy adulthood. 8 and 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7501, $12. (Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. *BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available. (Stephen Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. AFRICAN BLUE NOTES (Tonight) Martin Atangana, an accomplished Cameroonian guitarist and vocalist, leads this contemporary Afro-jazz quintet. 10 and 11:30 p.m. and 1 a.m., Zinc Bar, 90 West Houston Street, at LaGuardia Place, West Village, (212)477-8337; cover, $5, with a one-drink minimum. (Nate Chinen) AMRAM & CO (Monday) The composer and multi-instrumentalist David Amram has led a profoundly diverse career in music, which he celebrates with this guest-laden evening performance. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212)989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) MICHAEL ATTIAS'S CLINAMEN SEXTET (Thursday) Taking its name from the ''atomic swerve'' concept envisioned by the Epicurean poet-philosopher Lucretius, the group Clinamen consists of improvisers attuned to the mystery of cause and effect: Mr. Attias on alto saxophone, Tony Malaby on tenor and soprano saxophones, Mark Taylor on French horn, Matt Moran on vibes, Brad Jones on bass and Tyshawn Sorey on drums. 8 and 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) *CARAMOOR JAZZ FESTIVAL (Tomorrow and Aug. 6) The tenor and soprano saxophonist Joe Lovano programs jazz at the idyllic Caramoor estate, managing a fusion of contemporary vigor and historical sweep. The first of two all-day concerts pays homage to the bebop progenitors Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, the idiosyncratic musician-composers Thelonious Monk and Charles Mingus, and the percussive architect Max Roach. Mr. Lovano will also perform, alongside his fellow saxophonists David Liebman and Michael Brecker. 3 p.m., Venetian Theater at Caramoor, Katonah, N.Y., (914)232-1252, www.caramoor.org, $45 and $55. (Chinen) RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) ''In Flux'' (Savoy), Mr. Coltrane's fourth album, is a significant milestone; his tenor and soprano saxophone playing have never sounded more confident, and his compositions have a sleek modernistic hue. As on the CD, he fronts a stellar band: the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer E.J. Strickland. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) DEWLINE (Wednesday) This quartet honors the interdisciplinary artistry of the soprano saxophonist and composer Steve Lacy, who died last year; the players are Dave Ballou on trumpet, Kristin Norderval on vocals, Kevin Norton on vibraphone and John Lindberg on bass. 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) DUANE EUBANKS QUINTET (Thursday) This hard-bop trumpeter leads a powerful group with J.D. Allen, saxophonist; Orrin Evans, pianist; Eric Revis, bassist; and Eric McPherson, drummer. 8 and 10 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626; cover, $15, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) JOE FARNSWORTH AND FRIENDS (Tonight and tomorrow) The light-handed yet propulsive drumming of Joe Farnsworth has made him a quiet force in the jazz mainstream; he's joined here by the percussionist Ray Mantilla, the pianist David Hazeltine and the bassist Nat Reeves. 8 and 9:45 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212)885-7119; cover, $15, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) *FESTIVAL OF NEW TRUMPET MUSIC (Tuesday through Aug. 7) Curated by the progressive-minded trumpeters Dave Douglas, Roy Campbell and Jon Nelson, this six-day series, dubbed FONT, pays homage to the Art Ensemble of the Chicago instigator Lester Bowie, who died in 1999. Among the many highlights are the Bill Dixon Trio, on Tuesday; Graham Haynes's Electric Church, on Wednesday; and Mr. Douglas's Brass Ecstasy, on Thursday. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. (with 11:30 sets Aug. 5 and 6), Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232, www.fontmusic.org; cover, $25. (Chinen) SONNY FORTUNE QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) Since the 1960's, countless saxophonists have adopted the methodology of John Coltrane, but few have captured his restless spirit; Mr. Fortune, the saxophonist of choice for the Coltrane drummer Elvin Jones, is chief among them. 8 and 10 p.m. and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera GLIMMERGLASS (Tonight through Thursday) To be counted among the country's leading summer opera festivals, it helps to have imagination and unusual repertory, and Glimmerglass offers both in spades. All four of the season's operas are now in rotation. One highlight is a new production of Benjamin Britten's wonderful and too-seldom-performed ''Death in Venice,'' directed by Tazewell Thompson and featuring William Burden. The season's other offerings are Mozart's ''Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte,'' the French version of Donizetti's ''Lucie de Lammermoor'' and an unusual double bill consisting of ''Portrait de Manon,'' Jules Massenet's one-act sequel to his most famous opera, paired with Poulenc's one-acter ''La Voix Humaine,'' which depicts a woman on the phone. ''Lucie,'' tonight at 8 and Monday afternoon at 2; ''Portrait'' and ''Voix,'' tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 and Tuesday afternoon at 2; ''Cos\u00ec,'' tomorrow night at 8; ''Death in Venice,'' Sunday afternoon at 2 and Thursday night at 8, Alice Busch Theater, Route 80, eight miles north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607)547-2255, $31.50 to $97. (Anne Midgette) 'REGINA' (Tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) Most people know Lillian Hellman's play ''The Little Foxes'' from William Wyler's classic 1941 film version starring Bette Davis as the ruthless matriarch of a crumbling Southern family. But in 1949 the American composer Marc Blitzstein, whose centennial is being celebrated this year, introduced his operatic version, titled ''Regina'' after the main character. With its populist score -- a deft melding of spiky contemporary harmony, jazzy bits and American vernacular music -- the opera has been gaining adherents over the years. Bard College's SummerScape series is presenting a production directed by Peter Schneider and conducted by Leon Botstein, with the fearless soprano Lauren Flanigan in the Davis role. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Fisher Center for the Performing Arts, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845)758-7900, $35 to $65. (Anthony Tommasini) Classical Music ASTON MAGNA (Tomorrow) The early-music scene in the Northeast has long shuttled between New York and Boston, and what better middle ground is there in the summer than the Berkshire foothills? The featured artist tonight is the estimable pianist Robert Levin, who doubles as musicological sleuth. Here on fortepiano, he joins the violinist Daniel Stepner and others in Beethoven's arrangement of his Fourth Piano Concerto for string quintet rather than orchestra. 5 p.m., Daniels Arts Center, Simon's Rock College, Great Barrington, Mass., (413)528-3595 or (800)875-7156, $35; in advance, $30; students and 65+, $25.

Oestreich) BANG ON A CAN SUMMER MUSIC INSTITUTE (Tomorrow, and Monday through Thursday) Since new music tends to find more sympathetic ears in the art world than in many concert halls, Bang on a Can takes its concerts into a museum -- specifically, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, where two informal concerts a day showcase the faculty and participants of its summer learning program. The group even transplants its signature event, the marathon, in a six-hour version ranging from Wolfe to Reich to Crumb to Xenakis to Andriessen to Tenney to you get the picture. Marathon, tomorrow afternoon at 4; other recitals, Monday through Thursday at 1:30 and 4:30 p.m., Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, Mass., (413)662-2111.

This week, the early music specialist Gary Thor Wedow leads Bach's majestic Mass in B minor. 8 p.m., the Berkshire School, Route 41, Sheffield, Mass., (413)229-1999, $25 to $40. (Kozinn) BRIDGEHAMPTON CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow, Sunday and Wednesday) The flutist Marya Martin did not want to spend summers schlepping to far-flung festivals, so she and her husband, Ken Davidson, founded a festival of their own, now in its 22nd season. Tomorrow night at 6:30, at the Atlantic Golf Club, there will be a benefit concert to support the festival, featuring Italian music. Sunday, it's Mozart and Telemann, and Wednesday, an all-French program featuring Debussy, Faur\u00e9 and Durufl\u00e9.

Highlights include a recital by the virtuoso pianist Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin tomorrow night. He plays Schubert's Sonata in A (D. 664), Godowski's ''Nine Studies After Chopin's \u00c9tudes'' (which are even harder versions of Chopin's daunting works) and Liszt's dazzling operatic paraphrases of music from ''Norma,'' ''Ernani'' and ''Tristan und Isolde.'' In two concerts on Sunday you can hear in recital the finalists of the festival's competition, the Dorothy MacKenzie Awards.

(Kozinn) MOSTLY MOZART (Monday through Thursday) Mozart has gotten a new shine in New York: at least, this perennially popular Lincoln Center-based festival bearing his name has a new spring in its step, and on its program, since Louis Langr\u00e9e became its music director two years ago. Certainly the festival orchestra is sounding better, as it should demonstrate in concerts during the first week of a season organized around the theme of ''Mozart's Travels,'' extending its embrace all the way to Russia, where Mozart never actually went. Mozart in Vienna is the focus on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a piece by Haydn and three by Mozart, including the Piano Concerto No. 22 with Emanuel Ax, and a concert aria with the soprano Emma Bell. Mr. Ax also offers two hourlong late-night concerts, one with Ms. Bell, in a series called ''A Little Night Music.'' Thursday is the festival debut of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, while on Monday the unquenchable Rob Kapilow analyzes ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'' in his popular series ''What Makes It Great?'' Monday night at 8, Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; Tuesday and Wednesday nights at 8, Avery Fisher Hall (orchestra); Tuesday and Wednesday nights at 10:30, Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street, 10th floor (recitals); Thursday night at 8, Alice Tully Hall (Kammerphilharmonie), (212)721-6500, $25 to $58 for the orchestral concerts; $30 for the late-night recitals.

This is a 2000 reconstruction by Pierre Lacotte of an early Petipa Egyptian fantasy. Although Sergei Filin has had to drop out of his scheduled performances as Lord Wilson, the leading role of Aspicia should be in good hands: Maria Alexandrova tonight, Svetlana Lunkina tomorrow afternoon and Svetlana Zakharova tomorrow night. Tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000 or www.metopera.org; $45 to $150.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums *AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith) AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. 45 West 53rd Street (212)265-1040. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Holland Cotter) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'\u00eatre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Glueck) THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'FROM CALLOT TO GREUZE: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM WEIMAR,' through Aug. 7. This show sprints through French art of the 17th and 18th centuries and reveals it to be a phenomenon of varying moods and accomplishments. The 70 drawings, including some by Claude Lorrain, Watteau and Boucher, are from the municipal holdings of the German city of Weimar. And many were acquired by that collection's first curator, the great writer, philosopher and lover of all things French, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter) *GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS,' through Aug. 24. This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Smith) GUGGENHEIM: 'OTEIZA: MYTH AND MODERNISM,' through Aug. 24. With the goal of paring down sculpture to an emptied (not ''empty'') space that he saw as filled with spiritual energy, the Basque sculptor Jorge Oteiza (1908-2003) worked intensively during the 1950's, creating the right containers. Experimenting with a number of different mathematical models, he undertook processes like ''opening polyhedrons'' and ''emptying'' spheres and cubes, to arrive at a series called ''Metaphysical Boxes,'' made from the opposition of two trihedrons. The dark, nearly inaccessible spaces he created here seem to take on a religious character. When, at the end of the 1950's, he felt he had met his goal, Oteiza turned to Basque political and social causes. But his work, mostly small in scale, smacks too much of theory to be of exciting visual interest. (See above.) (Glueck) *INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterly landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith) *MET: MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES, through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of both his life and his work. (See above.) (Smith) MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,' through Sept. 11. A selection of fair-to-good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Ken Johnson) *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman) *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: C\u00c9ZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that C\u00e9zanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter) NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck) P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman) UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept.18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approach and sensibility. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck) *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman) WHITNEY MUSEUM: BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith) Galleries: Uptown *'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN' ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. Neue Gallerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200, through Sept. 26. (Glueck) Galleries: 57th Street *'REPEAT PERFORMANCE' More than 20 artists use repetition as their main formal device and many different kinds of materials. The show includes concentric circles drawn by Eva Hesse; black pinstripes painted by Frank Stella; solid glass orbs with opalescent surfaces attached to the wall by Tom Bell; colored wax copies of plastic tumblers by George Stoll; and botanically accurate leaves made entirely of staples by Alison Foshee. Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212)755-0434, through Sept. 17. (Johnson) CHRISTI\u00c1N SILVA: 'THE ENGLISH GARDEN' The best works by this Guadalajara-based artist are puzzling but have a visceral material presence. The trembling green rubber hands sticking out from a wall holding bunches of real parsley and coriander are especially weird. The life-size green man on the floor under a pile of vegetables is strange, too. But the big charcoal wall drawing of a drum kit is forgettable. Projectile, 37 West 57th Street, (212)688-4673, through Aug. 5. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea *'BEBE LE STRANGE' This tense, lively group show devoted to images of the figure includes strong work by a bunch of strong young artists, including Benjamin Degen, William Jones and Eileen Quinlan, and fascinating photographic work of documentary fiction by Zoe Crosher and Leslie Grant. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)352-9460, through Aug. 12. (Cotter) *'BRIDGE FREEZES BEFORE ROAD' The big, hot group show of the summer pays homage to Robert Smithson, and casually retools countercultural languages of yesteryear for the 21st century. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through Aug. 19. (Cotter) *'GREY FLAGS' Organized by the artist Seth Price, this coolest of summer group shows puts New York art on an interesting track and looks to the future. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)680-9467, through Aug. 12. (Cotter) 'IDOLS OF PERVERSITY' Inspired by a 1980's book with the subtitle ''Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin de Si\u00e8cle Culture,'' this show substitutes Surrealism for Symbolism for its prevailing mode, academic painting as its preferred style, and the contemporary art star John Currin as its patron saint. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Aug. 6. (Cotter) DAVID LEVINTHAL: 'XXX SEX DOLLS' Mr. Levinthal is known for his provocatively ironic photographs of war toys, racist kitsch and pornographic dolls. Here, along with faux-pornographic photographs, he presents 30 female miniatures from his collection; they are kitschy marvels of sexist fetishism. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212)627-4819, through Aug. 19. (Johnson) 'LIVING FOR THE CITY' Organized by an institution-in-formation, the Brooklyn Institute of Contemporary Art, this group show has artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, some making New York debuts. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, (212)645-1701, through Aug. 5. (Cotter) 'STICKS & STONES' Images of skulls dominate this group show of mostly drawings by John White Cerasulo, Santiago Cucullu and Andrew Guenther, with an ambitious, multipart marker-on-photocopy piece by Jay Heikes. Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 527 West 23rd Street, (212)627-8000, through Aug. 12. (Cotter) *'WALLS 'N' THINGS' This show about illusion and ambiguity includes a big, tough graffiti piece lifted from Barbie packaging; wall braces that support nothing; and a wall painting that isn't there until you suddenly see it, after which it is really, really there. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 213, (212)243-3335, through Aug. 5.(Cotter) Other Galleries 'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures painted naturalistically, real animals painted surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts. Participating artists include Catherine Howe, David Humphrey, Elizabeth Huey, James Esber, Anton van Dalen and many more. DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212)334-3400, through Sept. 2.(Johnson) JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall, aqua-blue box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10. (Johnson) 'DEAD KIDS DO NOTHING' It's hard to say what this better-than-average group show adds up to, but it includes a sweetly quixotic video by Lee Walton in which he makes minor alterations to outdoor situations he encounters; another video, of a swimming mouse shot from under water by Adam Stennett, the show's organizer; lonesome modern interiors drawn in blue ink by Rebecca Chamberlain; and a dreamy, elegiac photograph of a dead pigeon shot with a pinhole camera by Jan Dunning. 31 Grand, 31 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)388-2858, through Aug. 7. (Johnson) JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 15. (Johnson) SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson) Last Chance *'ATOMICA: MAKING THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE' This carefully orchestrated international group show marks the 60th anniversary of the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan, on Aug. 6 and Aug. 9, 1945. Shiva Ahmadi, Ellen Levy, Nancy Spero and Hiroshi Sunairi contribute subtle work. Esso Gallery (212)560-9728, 531 West 26th Street, second floor, and Lombard-Freid Fine Arts, (212)967-8040, 531 West 26th Street, fourth floor, Chelsea, closing today. (Cotter) 'ELEVEN NGUYENS AND THE THIRTY YEAR LOSS' The independent curator Trong G. Nguyen has conceived a novel and bittersweet way to celebrate the recent anniversary of the surrender of South Vietnam to the Communist North on April 30, 1975. He has gathered together works by 11 contemporary artists who all share the name Nguyen, pronounced ''win.'' He contributes a cake with thick frosting of yellow paint and lettering that reads ''Happy Birthday War.'' PH Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212)564-4480, closing today. (Johnson) 'FEAR GEAR' The best piece in this mildly political show is Maria Marshall's video ''The Emperor and His Clothes,'' in which a boy puts on and takes off absurd amounts of clothing while the soundtrack plays layered excerpts from a speech by President Bush. Also: a video of Patty Chang dancing while being splattered by paint; a knotted and suggestively dangling rubber baseball bat by Via Lewandowsky; and a mural of military clothing fragments by Jean Shin. Roebling Hall, 606 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)929-8180, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) *THE GENERAL'S JAMBOREE: SECOND ANNUAL WATERCOLOR EXHIBITION Watercolor is a chronically underestimated art medium -- painting's poorer, implicitly feminine cousin. This may be one reason so many young artists have embraced it, armed with all kinds of intentions and techniques, including a few pointed at three dimensions, and also why this exhibition is, indeed, an exuberant jamboree. With the vogue for multimedia, it is also clarifying to see more than three score artists concentrating on just one. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212)625-9224, closing tomorrow. (Smith) *'I THROW HERRING TO THE DOG' Lillian Ludlow and Marcella Mullins, the curators of this odd and charming group show, are both clothes designers and artists, which may help explain the aesthetic of precision and improvisation that reigns here in work by Rita Ackerman, Kenneth Boyer Kloster, Sadie Laska and Patrick O'Leary, among others. Canada, 55-59 Chrystie Street, between Canal and Hester Streets, Lower East Side, (212)925-4631, closing on Sunday.(Cotter) 'IT'LL COST YOU ' In observance of the curious fact that Colonial American painters charged according to the number of human limbs visible in a picture, the collector Beth Rudin DeWoody has assembled a wildly pluralistic, often funny and kinky show of works that feature arms or legs by more than 40 artists. It ranges from a frieze of women's legs in high heels crisply painted by John Wesley to the hacked-off arm of an ape sculpted by Tony Matelli. Don't miss the tiny, finely made and well-shod wooden legs by Holly Laws in the backroom. Kathleen Cullen, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-8500, closing tomorrow. (Johnson). 'THE JEWELEIGHA SET' The works in this sharply focused yet ecumenical show of six artists inspired by fractal geometry fits together like a kind of rebus about the joy of numbers and numerousness in art, mathematics and nature. Greene Naftali Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-7770, closing today. (Smith) 'PHILOSOPHICAL TOYS' This exceptionally interesting show introduces three ingenious people who have studied learning and cognition through toylike objects and gamelike processes: Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel, the inventor of kindergarten; Shea Zellweger, who created toys for teaching his own system of logic; and Jeannine Mosely, a software engineer who explores paper folding. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212)431-5270, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) VITALY KOMAR: 'THREE-DAY WEEKEND' The work in Mr. Komar's first solo show is more personal and less zanily satirical than the art he produced with his longtime collaborator Alex Melamid, but it does involve ingenious play with political and cultural signifiers. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)226-3232, closing today. (Johnson) MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting, in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art; and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, closing on Sunday. (Smith) AERNOUT MIK: 'REFRACTION' In a plotless, silent 30-minute film, the camera slowly surveys the elaborately constructed aftermath of a bus accident on a rural highway. Though the show is well produced and absorbing to watch, you may find yourself wondering more about what it cost than about what it means. New Museum, 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222, through Sept. 10.(Johnson) 'MIRAGE' The desert and hallucination are the intertwined images here, in fine work by Jennifer Bolande, Robert Bordo, Moyra Davey, Robert Kinmont, Mary Lum, Stephan Pascher and Florian Pumh\u00f6sl. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)367-7474, closing today. (Cotter) *EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940' This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agust\u00edn Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272, closing on Sunday. (Cotter) MUSEUM AT THE FASHION INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY: 'FABULOUS! FASHIONS OF THE 1940'S' through July 30. Constructed around a selection of dresses from the institute's collection, this thought-provoking exhibition briefly tells what happened when the Germans invaded Paris, forcing that city to surrender its role as leader of world fashion to New York City -- at least until the end of the war. Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, (212)217-7999, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) 'PAINT IT WITH BLACK' Black is the bottom line in this handsome show, organized by the artist Phong Bui, which includes enigmatic little night thoughts from Forrest Bess, Philip Guston, Bill Jensen and Thomas Nozkowski; a big one from Christopher Martin; and a rare sighting of work by the writer-curator-art historian Robert Storr. Betty Cuningham, 541 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-2772, closing today. (Cotter) RICHARD STIPL: 'BLOC SABBATH' A dark-minded humanist and skillful sculptor, Mr. Stipl creates small, creepy, extremely realistic painted heads of grimacing men with secret-society emblems or images of famous women tattooed on their shaved skulls. An ensemble of 10 one-fourth-life-size nude men on a shelf represents a Boschian satanic ritual. Claire Oliver, 513 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)929-5949, closing tomorrow. (Johnson) *'SOMETHING IS SOMEWHERE' With art by 20 young artists, all women, this show makes an implicit feminist statement and offers art of formal variety and narrative intensity. Monya Rowe, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 504, Chelsea, (646)234-8645, closing tomorrow. (Cotter) *'THIS SIDE TOWARD SCREEN' With the arrival of digital imaging, slide projection became archaic technology, but as an artist's medium, it has a long and continuing history, which is touched on in new work here. Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212)463-7372, closing today. (Cotter) *'WE COULD HAVE INVITED EVERYONE' Depending on your interest, this excellent, sprawling show about the micronations and fictive states founded by artists, eccentrics, political malcontents and other subversives will either feel like the tip of the iceberg or overload. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 516A West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8849, closing today.
