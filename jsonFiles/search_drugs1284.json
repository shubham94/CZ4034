One man asked whether having two or three drinks over a weekend constituted \"heavy drinking.\" Another wanted to know if half a bottle of wine a day, which he described as \"light drinking\" compared with his friends, was heavy drinking in my view. The confusion is common, according to experts at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. As the institute pointed out in a recent health alert: \"Moderate drinking is difficult to define because it means different things to different people. The term is often confused with 'social drinking,' which refers to drinking patterns that are accepted by the society in which they occur.\"", "headline": {"main": "Personal Health"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": 1214, "_id": "4fd1b3b28eb7c8105d6d7b03", "snippet": "A RECENT report warning heavy drinkers against taking supplements of beta-carotene prompted several queries from perplexed readers.

The information gleaned from taste-cell studies, mainly on animals like the mudpuppy and catfish, is expected to lead eventually to many tangible benefits. These include modifying people's \"taste appetites\" to aid in weight control, make dull, nutritious foods taste better, improve the taste perceptions and appetites of the elderly, produce tastier substitutes for sugars and salt, and develop drugs to counter taste disorders.", "headline": {"main": "How the Taste Bud Translates Between Tongue and Brain"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1834, "_id": "4fd1d40e8eb7c8105d710ea0", "snippet": "WHILE shrimp barbecued in a tangy marinade may provide your taste buds with a burst of simple delight, researchers who study the workings of individual taste cells have recently shown that those sensory organs are far from simple.
