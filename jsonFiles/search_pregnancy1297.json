The goal is to enshrine in law the concept of ''fetal rights,'' equal to but separate and distinct from the rights of pregnant women. In essence, the bill would elevate the status of a fetus, embryo or other so-called ''unborn child'' to that of a ''person'' by amending the Federal criminal code to add a separate offense for causing death or bodily injury to a ''child'' who is ''in utero.''
