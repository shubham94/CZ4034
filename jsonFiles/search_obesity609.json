Go to the symphony, the opera, the theater or the ballet and you're rewarded with a feeling of cultural accomplishment; if you like the production, you feel improved, and if you dislike it, you feel superior. Either way, you've won. But television is not for winners. Television is for low, exhausted potato people who slouch, and for their children, who are plopped in front of it. Slouchers and ploppers, that's us -- and we tend to incur the wrath of more upright types. But, in spite of that generalized scorn and the self-doubt it induces, the loser in all of us plainly can't stop watching television, partly because it affords an opportunity, in our hard-driving world, to waste time and energy flagrantly, to live profligately, to forgo winning. Moreover, great television shows capitalize on this defenseless state, allowing us to grieve, pass imaginatively into unusual mental states, laugh off anxieties, lose ourselves. Television, in fact -- to give the experience a paradoxical kind of dignity -- encourages us to practice the great art of losing.", "snippet": "While the content of \"Sesame Beginnings,\" a DVD series for the very young, is innocuous and even enjoyable, child-health experts are apt to think otherwise.", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "TRUGLIO, ROSEMARIE T", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "SESAME WORKSHOP", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "DVD (DIGITAL VERSATILE DISK)", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "RECORDINGS AND DOWNLOADS (VIDEO)", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "TELEVISION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "1", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 1481, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": [{"legacy": {"thumbnailheight": 75, "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnail": "images/2006/04/14/arts/sesame.1.7575.jpg"}, "height": 75, "type": "image", "url": "images/2006/04/14/arts/sesame.1.7575.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail"}, {"legacy": {"tinythumb": "images/2006/04/14/arts/14sesa337.jpg", "hastinythumb": "Y", "tinythumbheight": 242, "tinythumbwidth": 337}, "height": 242, "url": "images/2006/04/14/arts/14sesa337.jpg", "type": "image", "width": 337, "subtype": "tiny_thumb"}]}, {"news_desk": "Week in Review Desk", "document_type": "article", "_id": "4fd26ab48eb7c8105d8225d7", "headline": {"kicker": "Critic's Notebook", "main": "Be Merry, Not Ancient"}, "pub_date": "2006-04-09T00:00:00Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"original": "By FRANK BRUNI", "person": [{"lastname": "BRUNI", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Frank", "organization": "", "role": "reported"}]}, "abstract": "Frank Bruni article expresses doubt about recent study published in Journal of American Medical Association concluding that restricting individual's daily diet to 890 calories can lead to long, disease-free life; holds that we cannot predict tomorrow, and we cannot guarantee its arrival with specified number of calories, but we can often determine measure of joy we wring out of today; cites proverb: 'he lives long who lives well'; photo (M)", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/weekinreview/09bruni.html", "section_name": "Health; Week in Review", "lead_paragraph": "BECAUSE we all needed yet another set of rules to follow, because we had not yet been sufficiently bombarded with dictates about the colors of the fruits and vegetables we should eat and the ideal intake of alcohol and the optimal frequency of low-impact exercise, the Journal of the American Medical Association came along last week to tell us that serious calorie restriction might best serve the quest for a long, disease-free life. The number of calories in the daily diets of some participants in this latest study was -- gulp -- 890. Which, by my nonscientific research, is less than the average teenage or adult American who lives within a half mile of a Burger King and has not had gastric bypass surgery consumes for dinner.
