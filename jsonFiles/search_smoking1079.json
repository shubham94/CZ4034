The voluntary program, which involves about 35 companies representing 90 percent of the manufacturers of fine-art supplies, has been spurred by passage of a law in California last October to establish mandatory labeling of toxic art supplies and by the introduction of similar legislative proposals in New York and Massachusetts. The legislative efforts and the action by the manufacturers both arise from a growing concern that consumers be protected against chemicals in art supplies that are believed to cause serious illness as a result of repeated exposures over months or years. Range of Products Affected The labeling will affect a range of products from oil and acrylic paints to turpentine, ceramic glazes, solvents, clays and lithographic inks. Many materials containing the same chemicals that are used by artists and others but are not made by traditional fine-art manufacturers, such as ordinary house paints and other industrial materials, will not receive new labels.", "snippet": "Manufacturers of fine-art supplies used by hobbyists, schoolchildren and professional artists will soon begin to use labels that warn consumers that some of the products contain chemicals linked to such chronic diseases as nervous disorders,..."}], "meta": {"offset": 0, "hits": 2, "time": 59}}}
