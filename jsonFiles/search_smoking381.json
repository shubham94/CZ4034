With a cheer and a toot, another year starts. Then before you know what's what, that year, too, is yesterday's news. How does this happen? Time, which once felt limitless, then plentiful and then at least available, is becoming a problem. Art should help with this problem, shouldn't it? You go to a museum, and there art is, undiminished, just where it was before. But, no. Art is all tied up in time. Time is its subject and its substance. Art records time, measures it, manipulates it, invents it. Art also exists in time, is composed of it, is swallowed up in it. The idea of timeless art is sweet. But there is no ''timeless.'' And the longer a piece of art outlives its time, the more clearly it speaks of ephemerality, what is or will be gone.", "snippet": "It's early January, and exhibitions that opened last year are starting to close across the city.
