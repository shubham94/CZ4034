Adams, Commissioner of the Nassau County Department of Drug and Alcohol Addiction, says the efforts are largely imagery. Mr. Adams, the only commissioner since the department was created in 1972, says addiction is as widespread and community resistance to treatment centers as pronounced today as when he began his career. Apathy toward and denial of the problems, he contends, are as prevalent as ever among some parents and school administrators. Despite his strong support of anti-drug laws, Mr. Adams says that the long-term solution, if there is one, lies not in largely ineffective law-enforcement measures, but in emphasizing treatment and education. Mr. Adams, 59 years old, began his career in 1958 as a parole officer, rising to supervisor. In 1969, he became a supervisor of after-care services for the state's old Narcotics Addiction Control Commission. In 1970, he became director of a mental-health clinic in the East New York section of Brooklyn. A consultant to Federal and state agencies, Mr. Adams, in his $96,000-a-year position as Nassau Commissioner, supervises a $40 million budget that pays for 175 programs treating 25,000 people a year. A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Adams lives with his wife in Roosevelt. They have one daughter, a doctor in Manhattan. Q. How have the problems of chemical dependency evolved over the years, and what is the outlook for continued high levels of drug use? A. It's cyclical. We've gone through a lot of different eras in this department. We've had the high incidence of heroin abuse, the LSD scares, PCP -- all types of periods where one drug or another seems to be most popular. There's always a new drug. If you go through the history of this country -- starting with the Civil War veterans addicted to morphine and right through cocaine, marijuana and LSD -- there is always a different drug. The popular drug now, and the one creating so many problems, is cocaine and its derivative, crack. Q. Is there any satisfactory way to treat crack addiction? A. People are still learning, us included. One thing we've learned is that this population needs services very specifically developed to deal with that type of addiction. We find that residential treatment has to be more intensive, but on a shorter-term basis. Q. Hasn't the typical course of treatment at Topic House, the county-run residential treatment center in Plainview, been relatively long term? Does this show a change in philosophy? A. It does. Topic House has been basically a long-term facility where people have been in treatment for a year to 18 months, with 14 to 16 months a good average. We've been trying to revise that program to deal with the new addiction. You have to understand that we still have only one residential treatment center in Nassau County, Topic House. It had a capacity of 75, and recently expanded to 88. Just because we're dealing with the crack addiction there doesn't mean that heroin addiction has gone away. Heroin addiction is very much part of the scene. Crack is getting a lot of the publicity, but there has been an upsurge in heroin in recent months. Q. Your department recieved $3 million from the Federal Government last year to expand outpatient, methadone maintenance, day treatment and residential services. You had been having some problem finding space for the residential beds, and the financing was to run out at the end of September. What happened? A. We've been very successful in all the areas, with the exception of residential. We've asked that we be given more time for the residential phase and that the money originally awarded be diverted into day treatment, methadone and outpatient services, so that we wouldn't lose the money and, at the same time, would get an extension to develop additional residential treatment slots. We've been meeting with the county administration on this, and we're hoping that we'll be able to increase our residential treatment capacity by the middle of next year. In the interim, we've entered into a contract with a private organization called Mediplex, which runs short-term residential programs at two places near Albany and a third place in Pennsylvania that are pretty well suited to cocaine and crack addiction. Individuals in need of short-term treatment come through our inpatient unit and are placed immediately into treatment at one of those facilities, with the idea that they'll be receiving clinical treatment. Q. What are the prospects for being able to improve inpatient residential treatment? A. That very issue is now under discussion with the county administration. Because of the \"not in my backyard\" syndrome, if we're really going to do something, the answer is going to have to be on either county- or state-owned property, where a facility can be converted, utilized or built. We're exploring a plan possibly to do that on county property. That plan has not been fully developed yet. But we hope that by the middle of next year we will have a facility that will allow us to increase our residential capability by providing what I would call, for want of a better word, a halfway house for those individuals who come through Topic House, successfully complete the treatment phase and are being moved back into the community. Q. Is there a specific site or building in mind? A. No. Right now, the county is reviewing a couple of options. Originally, we had a Topic House at Mitchel Field in mind, but I don't think that's going to be a site location. The decision has not been made as to what county properties might lend themselves to that. Q. The Governor had been talking about a major expansion in the number of treatment beds. Is anything likely to come of that? A. No. In my opinion, that's not going to happen any time in the near future because the state faces on a statewide basis the same problem we face locally. That is, where do you put these programs? The state is going to have to take the lead and make its facilities available for these programs. Q. Your department provides individual counseling in a one-dormitory 60-bed treatment unit in the county jail. What are the prospects for expanding the number of people who are treated? A. My department has the responsibility for providing services only to the D.W.I. population in the jail. The substance-abuse program is run by the jail itself. We work cooperatively with them, but we do not run the program. Two things have happened that I think are significant. First, at the Sheriff's request, my department will be conducting intensive training programs for the jail staff that's going to be providing services. Second, my department, working cooperatively with the jail, has submitted a propoal -- and early reaction has been favorable -- to the Federal Government for a $4.1 million grant for three components: One for the expansion of women's and children's services and two for services under the criminal-justice system. The other criminal-justice component is probation. We're working very closely with the Probation Department in providing services for those individuals who are mandated into treatment by the courts. Q. How useful is it to arrest users of drugs, considering that so many are being referred for treatment? A. The law is the law, and people who violate it should be arrested, whether they're using drugs or breaking into houses. The law really is for possession and sales, although they go hand-in-hand with usage. We are working with the County Court and Probation Department to develop programs for those caught up in drug sweeps. We feel we can develop a program that will see to it that those individuals who, after evaluation, are found not to present a problem, can be referred into the treatment network. Let's face it. The jails are overcrowded, and we have to look for alternatives for those individuals who don't pose a threat and are interested in trying to change. Q. What do you think of the spending priorities among anti-drug agencies? Would it be better to spend more on treatment than on law enforcement? A. My feeling is that the drug war, or wars -- and I've been a part of just about every one -- are mostly imagery or public relations. The one we have currently is a good example. The so-called war on drugs, whose centerpiece was going to be Washington, has shown no significant changes a year later. The priorities have to be looked at and changed. The prevention and education initiative has been greatly underfinanced over the years, not only on the Federal level, but on the state level as well. The reason for this is that it is very difficult to graphically illustrate that prevention and education work. It takes time to work with kids and, hopefully, have an effect on their lives. But it's not dramatic -- not like having a big drug bust in which everyone gets his picture taken with great quantities of heroin or cocaine there. That appeases the public, but it does not really do anything in terms of eradicating the problem. Q. How do you react to the questioning of the value of drug education by William Bennett, the President's Director of Drug Control Policy? A. I find that very interesting in coming from the former Secretary of Education. The public has been misled. The current Administration's drug war has not really succeeded, and I think that part of the problem has been that there has been a lot of emphasis on the law-enforcement part of it and not enough emphasis on the treatment and prevention and education part of it. Q. Would the decriminalization or legalization of certain drugs reduce the street crime tied to drugs? A. Not in my opinion. That's a cop-out. The problem with our society is that we look for instantaneous cures. There is no such animal. We have to be prepared to deal with a 50-year-old problem with long-term solutions, not short-term fixes. We have to deal with the reasons people use drugs, Unemployment, housing, lack of educational, vocational and professional opportunities. Suddenly saying that now it's legal for people to use drugs, and taking the street value out of it, is not going to solve the problem. One of the things that concerns me is that there are still school districts in which the school administrations, board and possibly the parents have their heads in the sand, figuring this is a problem that does not affect them. There may be 10 or 12 districts where we feel this is a problem, and we're going to have to try to implement some program to get them involved in their communities. One of the problems is that some of these districts feel that if they get involved with my department, this is an indication, an acknowledgement, that they have a serious problem. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have to dispel that myth.", "headline": {"main": "A 30-Year Veteran in the Many Efforts to Combat Drugs", "kicker": "LONG ISLAND Q&A: HAROLD E.
