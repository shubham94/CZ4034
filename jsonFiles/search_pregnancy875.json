The dancing, choreographed by Royston Maldoom and rehearsed for nearly eight weeks by the schoolchildren from the Choir Academy of Harlem, the Bread and Roses Integrated Arts High School, Public School 153 and Public School 161, will take place on Nov. 17 and 18. Designed by Thomas W. Lamb (1871-1942), one of the foremost American theater architects of the 19th and 20th centuries, the United Palace Theater opened in 1930 as Loew's 175th Street, seating more than 3,000. On Nov. 13, 14 and 16, the Berlin Philharmonic is to appear at Carnegie Hall, where it will perform Mahler's Symphony No. 9, ''The Song of the Earth,'' and the unfinished Symphony No. 10 in the version by Deryck Cooke. Twain Prize for Crystal Billy Crystal, below, was named yesterday to receive the 10th annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. The honor will be bestowed on Oct. 11 at the Kennedy Center Opera House in Washington and broadcast nationwide by PBS in the fall. In a statement, Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman of Kennedy Center, said: ''The work he has created for stage, film and television has made an indelible impression. It is the work of not just a humorist but also a humanist.'' Mr. Crystal, who said he was honored to receive an award previously given to Richard Pryor, Steve Martin and Neil Simon, said, ''As my grandfather said, if you hang around the store long enough, once in a while they'll give you something.'' Scientists Fiddle And Out Comes a Strad In the latest miracle of modern science, researchers at Manchester University in England say they have developed an electronic device that can make a cheap violin sound like a rare Stradivarius, The Guardian of London reported. The device is called the Sound Wizard. Patrick Gaydecki, a professor of digital signal processing who leads the research team, said: ''The violin is like a bell or any resonant system. It vibrates with a characteristic signature.'' To extract the signature, the researchers use a laser pulse to record the vibrations before subtracting from the full violin sound the sound of the strings, which is essentially the same for every violin. Then they give the resulting sound the amplification provided by the body of a Stradivarius. ''In effect, the processing system becomes the violin body,'' Dr. Gaydecki said. Magicians Seek Cash For Coin Trick Exposure Forty-nine Japanese magicians have sued two Japanese television networks for showing viewers the secret behind their coin tricks, Agence France-Presse reported. The magicians are seeking 1.97 million yen ($16,400) -- and apologies -- from Nippon Television Network and TV Asahi. ''There was no need to reveal the secrets of tricks, and the defendants infringed upon the value of secrets of tricks, which are assets shared by magicians,'' the group of plaintiffs said in the lawsuit filed in Tokyo District Court. In November the networks' news programs showed how coin tricks were done, after the arrest of a magician and a pub operator for punching holes in coins for use in sleight of hand. Japanese law bars damaging or melting coins. Shintaro Fujiyama, 52, a plaintiff, said: ''It takes us many years to develop a coin trick as a professional tool. They must understand how all the time we have spent is wasted by exposure of the trick.'' Nippon TV declined to comment. TV Asahi said it believed there was no problem with its program. A Baby Girl for Star Of 'Whale Rider' Keisha Castle-Hughes, 17, below, who became the youngest actress nominated for the Academy Award for best actress when she appeared on the ballot in 2004 for her performance in the 2003 New Zealand film ''Whale Rider,'' gave birth to a girl last Wednesday, Agence France-Presse reported. Gail Cowan, her manager, said Felicity-Amore, the seven-pound, six-ounce infant, was ''beautiful.'' In a television interview broadcast last week, Ms. Castle-Hughes said she had wanted to hide after a public controversy over her pregnancy by her boyfriend, Bradley Hull, 19. ''I felt like it was bad for me to be happy about it,'' she said. Last year, she starred as the Virgin Mary in ''The Nativity Story.'' Footnotes Jason Patric has left MCC Theater's production of Neil LaBute's ''In a Dark Dark House'' over what the show's spokesman called ''creative differences.'' Frederick Weller (''Glengarry Glen Ross'') will take Mr. Patric's place, opposite the previously announced Ron Livingston. Performances begin on May 16 at the Lucille Lortel Theater. Rowan Atkinson (''Mr. Bean'') is to portray Mr. Micawber in the first big-screen adaptation of Dickens's ''David Copperfield'' since the 1935 George Cukor film, starring W. C. Fields in the role, Variety.com reported. ''David Copperfield,'' to go before the cameras next year, will be directed by Peter Howitt, who directed Mr. Atkinson in ''Johnny English.'' The Michael Crichton best seller ''The Andromeda Strain,'' about a deadly disease from outer space, will become a four-hour A&E mini-series, Variety.com reported. Production is to begin in the summer. The novel was previously adapted for a 1971 movie.", "headline": {"main": "Arts, Briefly"}, "abstract": "One hundred twenty New York City schoolchildren will dance with Berlin Philharmonic when Simon Rattle leads orchestra in two performances of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring at United Palace Theater; photo (S)", "print_page": "2", "word_count": 886, "_id": "4fd2751a8eb7c8105d83428e", "snippet": "Schoolchildren to Dance With Berlin Philharmonic  One hundred twenty New York City public-school children will dance with the Berlin Philharmonic when Simon Rattle, right, leads the orchestra in two performances of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' in...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E2DC103EF931A35756C0A9619C8B63", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "STRAVINSKY, IGOR"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BERLIN PHILHARMONIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DANCING"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Lawrence", "middlename": "Van", "lastname": "Gelder", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "Compiled by Lawrence Van Gelder"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2007-05-02T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Business", "lead_paragraph": "An emergency food supply can make an unplanned tarmac delay, if not pleasant, at least bearable.", "headline": {"main": "Trail Mix Isn\u2019t Just for Hikers", "sub": "Human Fuel for Flights That Don\u2019t Go According to Hoyle ;", "print_headline": "Trail Mix Isn\u2019t Just for Hikers"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "5", "word_count": "992", "_id": "54899ab77988104c1745b45a", "snippet": "An emergency food supply can make an unplanned tarmac delay, if not pleasant, at least bearable.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/01/business/01emergency.html", "multimedia": [{"subtype": "thumbnail", "url": "images/2007/05/01/business/01emergency.75.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2007/05/01/business/01emergency.75.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "Travel and Vacations", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Airlines and Airplanes", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Delays (Transportation)", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Food", "is_major": "N", "rank": "4", "name": "subject"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Karla", "lastname": "COOK"}], "original": "By KARLA COOK"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2007-05-01T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Business Day"}], "meta": {"hits": 8, "offset": 0, "time": 38}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
