Dozens of gecko lizards, all the same grayish color as the dingy, peeling paint, skitter along the walls, but Munger seems not to see them either. Making his way down a sweltering hallway, he passes countless children, their faces marred since birth, with raw, gaping holes where their lips and noses should be. The children stare at Munger -- his red beard and pale skin are oddities here -- but he does not stare back. Though they may never have seen a face like his, he has seen hundreds of faces like theirs. The sight has lost its power to shock, but not to sadden, so he keeps his gaze straight ahead and walks on. A hand-lettered sign taped to a rickety partition identifies his corner of one room:Genetics.Inside a makeshift cubicle sits a woman, Editha Bensi, her eyes clamped tight and her malformed mouth quivering while her blood flows out of a needle in her arm and into a vial. Next it is her children's turn. Nurses restrain Matthias, 5, and Maria Ana, 2, then prick their fingers, squeezing out 10 crimson drops onto an absorbent white card. Editha's vial, still warm to the touch, is labeled and placed in a box with dozens of others. The children's cards, the spots not yet dry, are clipped to a piece of twine that hangs along one wall. With every tepid blast from the air-conditioner, the cards jump and dance, like blood-splattered laundry in a breeze.", "headline": {"main": "The Clues Are in the Blood"}, "abstract": "Lisa Belkin cover story article on efforts of high-tech, intrepid gene hunters seeking to find causes of cleft lip and palate in the DNA of poor and isolated people of remote Philippine island of Cebu; describes work of Ronald Munger, genetic scientist at Utah State University, in collecting blood and other information about population on Cebu, where rate of cleft lip and palate is twice as high as it is in United States; best way to locate a disease gene is usually to screen DNA of affected relatives who have stayed in one place for generations; American-based group called Operation Smile finances yearly missions to Philippines, flying in nearly 200 surgeons and medical support staffers and reconstructing more than 1,000 cleft lips and palates over two-week period; photos (L)", "print_page": "46", "word_count": 7746, "_id": "4fd1fb298eb7c8105d759378", "snippet": "A menacing spider creeps across the floor of the h. w. miller memorial Sanitarium and Hospital on the Philippine island of Cebu, but Ronald Munger appears not to notice.
