When the final stages of mapping the human genome were hyped last month, both President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair called for a swift, extensive ban on using genetic information to discriminate in employment or insurance. Clinton had already signed an executive order back in February, banning such discrimination for federal employees. True to form, both politicians had polling data to support them. A 1998 survey of 1,000 randomly selected Americans found that 63 percent of them balked at any genetic testing if an employer or health insurer could have access to the data. So a ban on genetic discrimination not only secures privacy and fairness; it also protects good research by reassuring study volunteers that the information they provide is in completely safe hands. What's not to like? Well, quite a lot, actually. Like most notions that command almost universal assent, the proposed ban on genetic discrimination makes far less sense the more you think about it. A few brave souls, like the writer Michael Kinsley, have pointed this out, but even he admitted that he wasn't sure what conclusion to draw.
