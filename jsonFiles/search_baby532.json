The chubby yellow lab and her owner, K., used to go on long rambles through the California hills. But for the past year, Parmesan has planted her rump as soon as she hits the driveway.

They try again with the same result. And once more. They also observe K., whose dark eyes are as large and doleful as her pet's.
