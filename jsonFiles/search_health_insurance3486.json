''People need to realize that your e-mails can be read and made public, and that you need to be cautious,'' she warned recently on ''Larry King Live.'' Lewinsky was unsettled by Kenneth Starr's decision to subpoena Washington bookstores for receipts of her purchases; in her underappreciated biography, ''Monica's Story,'' she points to the bookstore subpoenas as one of the most invasive moments in the Starr investigation. But she was also distraught when the prosecutors subpoenaed her home computer. From the recesses of her hard drive, they retrieved e-mail messages that she had tried unsuccessfully to delete, along with the love letters she had drafted -- but never sent -- to the president. ''It was such a violation,'' Lewinsky complained to her biographer, Andrew Morton. Many Americans are beginning to understand just how she felt.
