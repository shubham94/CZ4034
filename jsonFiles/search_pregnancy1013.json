In a healthy woman, it contains 100 percent of virtually everything a baby needs to survive, plus a solid hedge of extras to help ward off a lifetime of diseases like diabetes and cancer. Breast milk helps disarm salmonella and E. coli. Its unique recipe of fatty acids boosts brain growth and results in babies with higher I.Q.'s than their formula-slurping counterparts. Nursing babies suffer from fewer infections, hospitalizations and cases of sudden infant death syndrome. For the mother, too, breast-feeding and its delicate plumbing of hormones afford protection against breast and ovarian cancers and stress. Despite exhaustion, the in-laws and dirty laundry, every time we nurse our babies, the love hormone oxytocin courses out of our pituitaries like a warm bath. Human milk is like ice cream, Valium and Ecstasy all wrapped up in two pretty packages. But read down the label, and the fine print, at least for some women, sounds considerably less appetizing: DDT (the banned but stubbornly persistent pesticide famous for nearly wiping out the bald eagle), PCB's, dioxin, trichloroethylene, perchlorate, mercury, lead, benzene, arsenic. When we nurse our babies, we feed them not only the fats, sugars and proteins that fire their immune systems, metabolisms and cerebral synapses. We also feed them, albeit in minuscule amounts, paint thinners, dry-cleaning fluids, wood preservatives, toilet deodorizers, cosmetic additives, gasoline byproducts, rocket fuel, termite poisons, fungicides and flame retardants.", "headline": {"main": "Toxic Breast Milk?", "kicker": "THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 1-09-05: FIRST PERSON"}, "abstract": "Florence Williams article on breast milk, which is filled with nutrients babies need, but also with toxins ingested by nursing mothers through diet and other exposure; says some chemicals in her milk will stay in her daughter's body long enough to be passed on to her own offspring; says even with strict dietary precautions, there are certain pervasive toxins that cannot be easily avoided and that taint breast milk; traces how America became so dependent upon chemicals, with emphasis on flame retardants known as PBDE's, polybrominated diphenyl ethers; photos (L)", "print_page": "21", "word_count": 3464, "_id": "4fd257138eb7c8105d800def", "snippet": "While breast milk is filled with all the nutrients babies need, it also contains traces of harmful chemicals.
