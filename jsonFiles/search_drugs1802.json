After 18 days of strikes, under floodlights from television crews from around the world and to the strains of the Polish national anthem, Lech Walesa and a deputy prime minister signed a document that, for the first time, ceded representation o the workers to an organization outside the control of the Communist Party. Poland has changed light-years from that day last August when Mr. Walesa signed the historic accord with a footlong, gaudy souvenir pen from Pope John Paul II's visit the year before. The pen was a theatrical touch that seemed to indicate that the dictatorship of the proletariat, having finally arrived, might even let a bit of humor back into the dreary lives of Poles. It seems to be a different country. It is certainly the freest nation in Communist Eastern Europe, including Yugoslavia, and perhaps anywhere in the Communist world.", "headline": {"main": "POLAND, ONE YEAR LATER, IS A SOCIETY TRANSFORMED"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": 1781, "_id": "4fd11cfd8eb7c8105d5da747", "snippet": "One year ago tomorrow, the Solidarity trade union was born.

These special antibodies, the most potent biological ''guided missiles'' known to science, were given repeatedly while the doctors watched for signs of dangerous toxicity from the new treatment. There were no such signs. By the end of four weeks the man was looking better and feeling better. Some tumors on his skin disappeared; others became soft and flat, signs that they were being attacked. The patient's fevers and night sweats ceased.
