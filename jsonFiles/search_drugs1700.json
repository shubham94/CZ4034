The research represents one of several dramatically new modes of attack on human diabetes, a widespread disease that still, despite decades of research, can be neither prevented nor cured but only alleviated, and even with the best medical management continues to cause blindness, loss of limbs and premature death in some patients. If applied to humans, however, the new technique of transplanting the fetal pancreas might raise a highly emotional issue. The only source for such transplants would be aborted human fetuses. In the United States, a Federal commission studied the propriety of using human fetal tissues for medical research, in the mid-1970's and found it ethically acceptable. That determination was written into regulations of what is now the Department of Health and Human Services. But in Australia, the pancreas transplant research has evoked recent protests from antiabortion activists even though the first use of the technique in humans may still be several years away.", "headline": {"main": "TRANSPLANTATION OF FETAL CURES POINTS TOWARD DIABETES CELL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1570, "_id": "4fd12b2b8eb7c8105d5f461e", "snippet": "SCIENTISTS in California and Australia have eliminated diabetes in some laboratory animals by giving them pancreas glands transplanted from fetuses of the same species.

That bygone era set store by a very different image of children and childhood as well. Children, at least until they reached the ''terrible teens,'' were seen as innocent, playful, childlike creatures in need of special protection, and parents were fiercely determined to keep childhood a carefree Golden Age.
