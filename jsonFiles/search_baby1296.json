The young anti-Victorians took as their ''Psalm of Life'' her verse about the candle burning at both ends. In later decades, especially the Thirties and Forties, her poetry stirred other fires. ''There are no islands any more,'' she wrote in 1940 in a passionate plea against isolationism as the world. ''Justice Denied in Massachusetts,'' a poem of the same period that was widely read, was an outburst at what she believed to be social injustice at home. Edna St. Vincent Millay was the most popular poet of her time, the only one who could live well by her writing, whose books were best sellers and collector's items. Her contemporaries, both critics and reading public, regarded her as one of the greatest poets to emerge in America in the years after World War I.", "headline": {"main": "Stamps; SHE WAS THE MOST POPULAR POET OF HER TIME"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "33", "word_count": 2269, "_id": "4fd119818eb7c8105d5d287a", "snippet": "The poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay, palpitating with the ecstasies and despairs of a youth that would never grow old, made her the idol of the generation of ''FLaming Youth'' of the Twenties.

By 1978, visits to doctors among the poor had climbed to an average 6.2 times a year, compared to five times annually for other Americans. Recently, Medicare and Medicaid have come in for hefty amounts of criticism from the Reagan Administration, and the recipients' more frequent recourse to physicians has been cited among the supposed abuses. The scale of the fiscal problems afflicting these programs was underscored last week when the cabinet officers who are its trustees disclosed that Medicare, which is for the elderly, was in a money crisis and that the Government fund supporting it would be able to keep the program solvent for only eight to 10 years. The cabinet officers said that Medicare, which cost $25.4 billion last year, was in even more serious trouble than the Social Security old-age fund, whose financial problems are more immediate and better publicized. Medicaid, the program for the poor, is expected to cost $24 billion by 1986. In 1967, the first full year of the program, Federal and state payments totaled $1.5 billion.", "headline": {"main": "DON'T THROW OUT THE BABY WITH MEDICAID-MEDICARE BATHWATER"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "word_count": 962, "_id": "4fd119818eb7c8105d5d288d", "snippet": "In 1964, two years before Federal Medicare and Medicaid programs began to pay health care bills of the poor and the aged, Americans visited physicians 3.8 times a year on the average, but the figure for the poor was 4.7.
