With a severity directly related to dose, marijuana impairs motor coordination and affects tracking ability and sensory and perceptual functions important for safe driving and the operation of other machines; it also impairs short-term memory and slows learning. Other acute effects include feelings of euphoria and other mood changes, but there also are disturbing mental phenomena, such as brief periods of anxiety, confusion, or psychosis.", "headline": {"main": "EXCERPTS FROM THE FEDERAL REPORT ON MARIJUANA"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "9", "word_count": 1076, "_id": "4fd11d778eb7c8105d5db5ae", "snippet": "Effects on the Nervous System and on Behavior   We can say with confidence that marijuana produces acute effects on the brain, including chemical and electrophysiological changes.
