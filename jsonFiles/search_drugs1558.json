By Joseph A. Califano Jr. 241 pp. New York: Random House. $17.95. A REVOLUTION, precipitated by seemingly uncontrollable costs, is occurring in our system of medical care, and the battle is joined between those who provide the care and those who pay for it. This is Joseph A. Califano Jr.'s thesis in ''America's Health Care Revolution.'' He believes that the traditional control of health care by doctors and hospitals is shifting to large corporations and to the Government because those who ultimately pay the doctor bills can determine the way their money is spent if they wish to. Mr. Califano says that when he was Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare from 1977 to 1979, he firmly believed that only the Government could solve the problem of rising medical costs, but his more recent experience in corporate America, and particularly with Chrysler Corporation as the chairman of its committee on health care, has led him to believe that the private sector must initiate the reforms that will be necessary to control costs.", "headline": {"main": "HOW THE BILLS GOT BLOATED", "kicker": "MIND/BODY/HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "34", "word_count": 1086, "_id": "4fd170158eb7c8105d662df9", "snippet": "AMERICA'S HEALTH CARE REVOLUTION Who Lives?

Dr. Freeman, who sees many seriously and terminally ill patients here at the University of Rochester's Strong Memorial Hospital, has been dealing for years with an ethical dilemma that the American Medical Association is only now beginning to face on a wider scale: whether to employ or withhold life-saving machines. Kidney dialysis machines were in the front wave of the technology that keeps people alive artifically. Indeed, today more than 80,000 Americans - eight times the 1972 figure - are being kept alive by dialysis units, which drain a patient's blood, cleanse it and return it to the body at a prescribed rate, temperature and chemical composition.", "headline": {"main": "EXTENDING LIFE OR PROLONGING DEATH?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": 772, "_id": "4fd14a6b8eb7c8105d62809c", "snippet": "''You find all kinds of patients trying to cope with dying - angry patients, calm patients, happy patients, sad patients,'' said Dr. Richard B.
