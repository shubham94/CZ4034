But in public schools these days, children all too often are neither learning to eat well nor to exercise. Fifty years ago, we had a preview of today's obesity crisis: a presidential council told us that America's children weren't fit -- and we did something about it, at great expense. We built gymnasiums and tracks and playgrounds. We hired and trained teachers. We made physical education part of the curriculum from kindergarten through high school.

Some ads, like those for toys and games, mostly threaten the family budget. But the commercials hawking sugary treats or empty calories can be more pernicious. Many health professionals now fear that junk-food advertising to toddlers and pre-teenagers is contributing to soaring rates of obesity and diabetes among the young. The Institute of Medicine, in a report last December sponsored by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that ''current food and beverage marketing practices put children's long-term health at risk.'' It argued that the onslaught of commercials directed at such very young children can set bad dietary patterns for life. And children under 8 are generally defenseless against sophisticated barrages from the giants in the food industry.", "snippet": "With more than nine million obese youngsters over 6 in this country, it's time to stop encouraging another generation to eat wrong.", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "ADVERTISING AND MARKETING", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "OBESITY", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "26", "type_of_material": "Editorial", "word_count": 424, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
