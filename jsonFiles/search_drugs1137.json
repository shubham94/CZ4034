And technical questions have multiplied. For example, scientists have discovered that the immune system may attack and destroy cells that were treated with gene therapy, seeing them as foreign or, when the genes were transferred by a virus, as infected.", "headline": {"main": "In the Rush Toward Gene Therapy, Some See a High Risk of Failure"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 1764, "_id": "4fd2004d8eb7c8105d763368", "snippet": "IN the six years since the first corrective genes were injected into the first patient, gene therapy has exploded.
