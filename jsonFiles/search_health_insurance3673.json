From before the first vote that day until long after the last, she met with her friend Harold Ickes on the second floor of the White House, in the family quarters, to weigh whether for the first time to promote herself rather than Bill Clinton for public office. Hillary Clinton felt flattered that Democrats were begging her to run for the Senate from New York, an idea she had laughed off when Representative Charles Rangel, the mischievous Manhattan Democrat, first suggested it in a Chicago church last October. She was delighted with the shift under way in her public image, from passive victim to political heavyweight. After all her policy work and speechifying, it had galled her to watch her popularity spike upward in the past year as she turned her lapidary smile to the world and suffered through the revelations of her husband's affair with that woman. Now, for four hours, as she and Ickes -- a scarred veteran of New York politics and a former aide to her husband -- moved from the living room to lunch in the family dining room and back to the living room, she plumbed the risks of a race for the Senate seat that Daniel Patrick Moynihan had decided to vacate.Would she really want to be one of a hundred Senators? Could she survive a street fight with a nasty opponent? Could she stand the pawing of New York City's feral reporters? The backing and forthing with Ickes had fitting precedent. Half a century ago, a woman Clinton regards as a role model, Eleanor Roosevelt, mulled running for the Senate from New York at the prompting of a former adviser to her husband. He was also named Harold Ickes; he was the father of Hillary Clinton's friend. But like so many parallels between the century's two most compelling first ladies, this one illuminates as many differences as similarities. Hillary had summoned her Harold, while Eleanor was importuned by hers. Pulled between her lofty aims and her cautious nature, Hillary was embarking on months of painstaking cogitation -- at the White House, on a trip through North Africa and in visits to New York. Eleanor almost immediately turned her Harold down. ''I feel very strongly that running for office is not the way in which I can be most useful,'' she wrote him on May 26, 1945, just days after he raised the idea. She did not want to burden her children with another office-holding parent. She also did not want to burden herself with having to follow what she called ''the party line.'' ''I hope to continue to work with the Democrats and for them,'' Eleanor continued briskly, ''but I think the knowledge that I will be free of any obligation may at times be very healthy.'' Free of any obligation. It is an expression lustrous with meaning for political spouses, and particularly for First Ladies of the United States. Since Martha Washington likened herself to a state prisoner, First Ladies have felt oppressed by arranging flowers or delivering speeches, by wielding influence or not enough of it, by the private compromises and the planetary humiliations. Eleanor Roosevelt feared continued limitation in winning office for herself. Hillary Clinton glimpses freedom, or so her friends and advisers say -- freedom to participate in politics fully, with her own constituents, on her own terms, for her own purposes. Hillary Clinton is about to become a liberated woman. Come January 2001, for the first time since she moved to Arkansas as a 26-year-old lawyer in 1974, she will be able to walk her own path regardless of her husband's political career. While most people provided such an opening might be fantasizing about anonymity and a long break, Clinton is methodically exploring her options for staying in the spotlight. If she does not pull out of the New York race in the next couple of weeks, she is likely to announce an exploratory committee in July, knowing that that will be regarded as throwing her hat in the ring. With that announcement, the Clintons would neatly reverse roles, at least regarding New York: she would step forward to present herself as a leader, while he would be relegated to behind-the-scenes, supporting chores. Yet when I asked Hillary Clinton earlier this month how it felt to weigh a career decision without having to consider her husband's political prospects, she started talking not about herself but about him and her role as supportive spouse. ''It has been such a part of our life together for the 28 years we've known each other,'' she said. Slowing down, she reverted to choosing her words like tomatoes in a shabby supermarket. ''And I've been very glad to be part of his particular political aspirations, because I've thought they've represented larger goals that he and I and many other people shared.'' She mused that she had never ''known him when he wasn't very interested in elected political life,'' and then made the kind of gentle joke at his expense that she loves. ''We'll just have to see how that -- how that works,'' she said, her words blending into her raucous laugh. ''You know, I'd be interested in what the odds are about how long it'll take before he runs for something else!'' I had met her minutes before in the third-floor solarium, a glassed-in den on the south side of the White House. Here, a veneer of family life spreads over the stolid symbol of Presidential authority. The walls leading to the solarium are tiled with framed pictures of the Clintons at work and at play -- lounging together in an Arkansas hammock, gathered at a picnic table with Chelsea. On the coffee table sat a dog-eared box of the word game Boggle. But there were reminders everywhere of the weirdness of this life. A family's collection of Russian nesting dolls -- near its collection of Beanie Babies -- does not usually include dolls of the family itself, alongside the Reagans and Bushes. The view outside the windows, over the pink geraniums on the terrace, is not usually of the top of the Washington Monument. The glass is not usually thick enough to be slightly distorting. ''I haven't been outside in sooo long,'' Clinton said, compressing her lips in a mock pout, as she asked if we might talk on the terrace. There, she spoke about growing tomatoes and peppers in pots aIt's very hard, I've found, to get good, fresh tomatoes, 'cause I don't get to go to farm stands or anything'' -- after she politely asked a steward to wipe off her patio chair to avoid dirtying her robin's-egg blue suit. She requested a glass of iced tea along with her Diet Coke, to get what she called ''a double load of caffeine.'' I tried again: But what will this change mean for her, as she thinks about what she wants to do? ''But I've always thought about what I want to do,'' she said. And then she started talking about her husband again, and the library he is building in Arkansas. ''We will continue to work together on issues and causes that we share in common, and the library, which I hope will be a vital and dynamic place for exploring public service in the future.'' Again: How about the prospect of having her own constituents and platform? She talked about her work as a lawyer, and then made with the husband one more time. ''I've chaired the commissions that my husband asked me to chair. I've been actively involved in politics both on behalf of him and on behalf of so many others.'' For years we have heard about the two Hillary Clintons, the self-sufficient crusader and the stand-by-her man helpmate. For Washington insiders, as for many Americans elsewhere, the assumption has long been that the latter is a facade, a painted nesting doll within which the real Hillary smolders. That assumption has always been lazy, and it has usually been wrong. Hillary Clinton is both, but she has been more at ease, and most effective, in the helpmate role -- watching his back, stiffening his spine, advocating their policies and defending their record. And after years of playing the part, she has become, de facto, a pretty traditional wife by modern standards, although she does not like to think of herself that way any more than her conservative critics do. Now, even as she was drawn to the idea of disentangling her political career from her husband's, she was struggling with whether she could put herself on the line, as he has done so many times. Once more I tried: Isn't it at least ''different'' to contemplate having your own direct constituents? ''It is,'' she conceded at last, nodding, perhaps out of pity. Then she adopted the second person, distancing herself even as she identified the difference she would feel. ''Because you would be the person with ultimate responsibility and authority.'' After years of counseling her husband and others to run for office and urging young people to have faith in the political system, she said, ''I'm trying to listen to my own advice.'' The firestorm over her husband's affair and impeachment would not deter her from running, she insisted. ''Last year was a painful time, for not only my family but my country,'' she said. Speaking now in the solarium after a spring storm chased us inside, she came as close as she would to discussing the humiliation that finally made her a hero to many Americans. ''But I feel, you know, that we all, we all got through that.'' There would be a Rip Van Winkle quality to Clinton's Senate campaign. Since she graduated from Yale Law School and opted for Bill Clinton and Arkansas, it has become unremarkable for women to compete for higher office. As she pondered the Senate race, Clinton was standing in the way of another woman, Representative Nita Lowey of Westchester County, and an older but far less traditional political spouse, Elizabeth Dole, was running for President. Clinton's race would be path-breaking, but only because she would be undertaking it while her husband was still in office. In that sense, it would certainly be pioneering for Clinton and for First Ladies, but not for women generally. She is too late for that. But so what? Clinton did not sacrifice her ambition to her husband's so much as yoke them together. As a result of that decision, it has been her fate to be judged more for how she has stood by her man than for what she has accomplished with him and more for what she represents as a woman than for what she has done as First Lady. As it happens, she has done quite a bit. And the flip side of the loyal role she has played is that she regards his accomplishments as hers too. When she was saving his Presidency last year -- condemning unnamed conspirators and then sticking with him after he admitted they were right about his affair -- she was also saving her own. As much as Bill Clinton has pursued his own ends at his wife's expense, he has depended on her to achieve power, keep it and figure out how to use it. As much as Hillary Clinton has sought out ways to express her independence, she has depended on him for her influence and served as his assistant. She left it to her husband to run, but she has always known what she wanted the two of them to do with his offices. Anyone who expects a new Hillary Clinton to burst from her White House cocoon has not studied her record or her relationship. Aides and friends of the Clintons are consistent in listing their relative strengths and weaknesses. Both love politics and policy, but he is more fascinated by the former and she by the latter. His is the superior mind; hers, the superior work ethic. He looks for compromise; she cements his resolve -- sometimes, as in the Whitewater investigation, disastrously. Both like to talk, but she also listens. He is quick to forgive his antagonists; she, as one of their friends put it, ''keeps the book.'' He searches to concede what is right in an opponent's position to win a larger argument; she -- the professional attorney her husband never was -- sees the world in black and white. Hillary Clinton's politics require villains, be they the entrenched interests of Washington, the insurance companies or right-wing conspirators. In that respect, she is like the lawyer she may run against, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York. The President's temper scares their advisers, but hers -- like a blowtorch, in the words of one -- terrifies them. While Bill Clinton is the warm one in public, he is often aloof in private; Hillary Clinton can seem chilly in public, but she remembers birthdays, sends gifts to spouses, asks after ailing parents. On that Friday in February, after the acquittal votes and her own meeting with Ickes, it was Hillary Clinton who turned up in the West Wing with an immense box of Valentine's Day chocolates for the staff. ''Thank you, Mrs. Clinton,'' said Doug Sosnik, the President's senior adviser, as he thought back to his miserable year and declined. ''I want to save my room for tequila.'' Clinton looked startled for a moment, Sosnik recalled, and then broke into an ear-to-ear grin. ''That's a good idea!'' she said. It is perhaps cruel to compare any politician to Bill Clinton, but that is the burden of his wife no less than Al Gore. And she does not have his ability to read a crowd or his joy for burrowing into one until his hands ache. That said, Hillary Clinton is operating under the presumption that she will run for the Senate, and she is looking for a house in Westchester County. Her goals remain rather vague, but her ambition for service and confidence in herself remain intact and vaulting. It is just that Bill Clinton is no longer the best vehicle. But that does not mean that she will run, and that points up another difference between the Clintons. When it comes to politics, he works from the gut as well as from his beloved polls, while she is more cerebral. The risks and challenges of a race excite him. They scare her. This is a defining life decision for her, perhaps the biggest she has made since her marriage, and in the end she may decide not to gamble her popularity and political clout. She does not want to lose. Horse-race polls don't mean much now, but the ones that showed her running away with victory have been replaced by others showing at best that she might squeak by Giuliani. And some of her advisers are more worried about a possible challenge from Representative Rick Lazio, the Long Island Republican, or even Gov. George Pataki. ''One of the lures of being Senator is you're out on your own,'' one of her advisers told me. ''One of the liabilities is you lose on your own.'' Hillary Clinton believes in the power of stories. She builds her speeches around anecdotes -- One single story can pierce through and make it clear that we are all in the same story,'' she said at the United Nations in March -- and she also believes that politicians can build and maintain support by constructing running stories about themselves and their policies. During the early days of Bill Clinton's first term, she urged his aides to think in terms of a ''story'' or ''journey'' for the Administration. ''Her vision of the journey was that these guys are solid, idealistic Democrats who are coming in to take on entrenched special interests for the sake of the common good,'' recalls George Stephanopoulos, the former Clinton aide. But that narrative, if ever real, was rudely elbowed aside by others: Whitewater, the health care debacle, the Gingrich revolution, Monica. For New York liberals, however, Hillary Clinton still embodies the idealism of '92. The adoring women -- and men -- who flock to her speeches talk less about what she has accomplished than what they are convinced she is capable of doing. And they talk not at all about how essentially Clintonian she is; they simply don't believe that. You sense, talking with them, that she has not yet proved to be the role model they want -- as Senator Chuck Schumer put it, ''sort of a latter-day Eleanor Roosevelt.'' ''I think she has the potential, I really do,'' said Jennifer Ballard, a graduate student. ''Given the opportunity, she would make many changes. She hasn't really been given the opportunity yet. I don't think she's had the ability to do what she'd like to do, and that young women like me would like to see her do.'' It was late April, and Ballard, 25, was musing about her hopes for Clinton at the back of a Columbia Teachers College auditorium, a packed room with folding wood chairs polished by generations of restless students. On the first day of a two-day swing through New York, Clinton was stopping by to talk about education, an issue she expects to be a winner for her should she run. Clinton was here on the taxpayer dime and officially on First Lady business, though her advisers privately acknowledged that she was testing the waters. By now, the idea of running for Senate had grown on her, to the amazement of senior White House officials who scoffed at the notion when it surfaced. After Moynihan announced on Nov. 6 that he would not run again, Rangel, who had previously joked with her about a race, called Clinton to press the issue -- and to his surprise, was met with a flurry of questions about how much support she would get. Rangel thinks that Clinton was already weighing the idea. But her advisers insist that she did not start thinking seriously about it until Senator Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, to her annoyance, told Tim Russert of NBC one Sunday in early January that she would probably run, wishing to make it so. She was astonished by the furor in the news media and called Ickes the next day for advice. Was she prepared to issue a ''Sherman-esque'' denial of any interest in running? Ickes asked. She wasn't. Then don't say anything, he said. With the impeachment trial under way, no one would expect her to give an answer immediately. But with the trial over and her husband rescued -- again -- she wanted to start thinking about her future. New York Democrats, desperate to hold onto Moynihan's seat, were clamoring for her. New York had a residency ''requirement'' so lax that it was more of a suggestion, and it had a tradition of embracing celebrity carpetbaggers. The President was entranced with the idea. Particularly after last year, his friends say, Clinton wanted to do anything he could to elect her, if only in hopes of getting out of the doghouse. On this day at Columbia, Clinton sat on stage as dozens of uniformed first and second graders serenaded her. Bill Clinton is the master of this kind of event, able to take a staged piece of political theater and find a human connection to make it real, or to make it seem real. And no one has studied Bill Clinton like his wife. She rose as the children filed off, walking to stage right to pat their shoulders as they went by. One tiny girl paused and rested her head against the First Lady's waist, throwing her arms around her as Clinton, beaming, bent to reciprocate. The girl's skinny white sleeves formed a bright line around Clinton's chocolate-brown suit. And now every girl was stopping for a hug, some going on tiptoe and turning their smiling faces up to be kissed, as the audience laughed and clapped and the cameras drank it in. It was hard, and rather amusing, to imagine Rudy Giuliani trying to pull this off. Clinton's speech was also calibrated to give the reporters what they needed. The money line was buried pretty deep -- 48 minutes into a 52-minute address -- but it was obvious enough that every idle pen began to scribble. ''We need to fix our public schools, not abandon them,'' Clinton said as she decried the vouchers to subsidize private education that Giuliani has adopted as a cherished cause. Her position gave the news stories an edge. Not much of an edge, though. Clinton would really have made news if she had said she supported vouchers, since Bill Clinton opposes them. It is impossible to find a single issue on which she and her husband disagree, and if cracks appear during a race, they are more likely to be over matters of pothole politics than high principle. (For example, Schumer has protested that the President's budget plan would cut $400 million in Medicare payments to New York hospitals over five years.) In our conversation, Clinton said she would have no problem contradicting her husband. ''If I were to do this race, I would feel very strongly that I owed my first duty to the people of New York, whom I would be asking to trust me and support me,'' she said. As most of her Columbia speech showed, however, running would bind her further to the President overall. It is his record she would campaign on. As she recounted for the students her credentials as an education reformer, she described going door to door for the Children's Defense Fund to determine why so many children were not enrolled in school. But someone else kept entering the picture. She recalled how ''my husband asked me to chair a committee in Arkansas aimed at improving the educational system there'' and how that committee succeeded ''because of the hard work of a lot of people and the leadership that my husband gave.'' She moved on to the White House years, as she lauded ''the President's, and certainly the Administration's, proudest achievements.'' And when it came time to look ahead, she declared, ''The President has laid out a bold strategy for the future.'' But, tentatively, she stepped out on her own as she turned to early child development, a subject she has labored, often behind the scenes, to keep on her husband's agenda. She talked about the need for ''better preschool opportunities.'' Then she stopped talking about what the President wants, what the Administration wants or even what ''we'' want, and said, ''That is why I have supported increased Federal support for programs such as home visiting, for Head Start, for child care, for early Head Start.'' A First Lady's support for her husband's policies is assumed. Here, Clinton was presenting herself as an independent voice on policy in the Administration, an image she had tried to avoid since the disaster of her health care proposal. And then she went further, saying that the Administration had not accomplished enough. ''I'm pleased that we've made some progress,'' she said, ''but we still have a long way to go.'' Clinton's record in her husband's office is clearest where it is least relevant to the voters who might elect her. Far more than in the United States, Hillary Clinton has found her own voice overseas. Abroad, she conducts a sort of shadow Presidency, with advisers borrowed from assorted agencies and an aging 707 whose port engine periodically bursts into flames. She does it with what amounts to her own foreign policy, promoting issues of women's rights, health care and development that her husband addresses rarely, and almost always with her at his side. In her speeches abroad, she seldom even mentions the President, not wanting to muddy her message of female empowerment by acknowledging that her influence derives from his power. Yet Clinton's passion for that role could be a problem in New York, where it plays into what her advisers view as her chief liability: the suspicion that she would have her eye on concerns far from Binghamton or the Bronx. It has probably not helped her that in her remarks about a possible race, she has tended to dwell on why New York is big enough for her, rather than vice versa. ''New York is truly a microcosm of America,'' she recently told reporters in Manhattan. Chuck Schumer has advised Clinton that if she decides to run, she will have to devote herself completely to the race. ''You can't be both First Lady and candidate,'' he says. Clinton has spent more days this year in North Africa than in New York. I went along with her to North Africa earlier this spring and stood nearby in a Moroccan village called Tasselmante as, calling across an empty chicken coop, she questioned one of the locals: ''How many chickens do you have?'' Ten. ''And they are healthier than your chickens used to be?'' Clinton inquired. Yes, the woman said through an interpreter, crediting the coop. A nonprofit group, the Near East Foundation, has been promoting its use among the village women. Clinton's solo international trips -- to Africa, Asia, the former Soviet republics, Latin America -- seldom generate much attention in the United States, but they are front-page news in the nations she visits. Knowing that, Clinton aims her spotlight at programs that are giving women power, attempting a very gentle advocacy-by-exhibit. To the chicken farmer's left stood a woman showcasing a new clay oven favored by the nonprofit. Clinton also viewed the village's biggest improvement, a system of potable water courtesy of the Japanese Government. It was driven by a diesel engine, which coughed loudly to life as its tender, a village man, turned its key to demonstrate. ''That's huge,'' Clinton exclaimed when told that 36 homes now had running water. New York has a rich tradition of internationally minded leaders, and for some voters Clinton's work abroad has great appeal. But those are people who would vote for her anyway. Among swing voters she hopes to woo, particularly in the suburbs, globe-trotting even in a worthy cause may not go over well. It is almost as if they want to pick a state senator rather than a United States senator, said one of her advisers, who has viewed union polling data on the state. ''They're not looking for a Jacob Javits or even a Pat Moynihan,'' this adviser told me. ''They want someone who's going to come talk to them about their school system in Syosset or Bayside.'' Clinton has recently been drawing connections between her foreign travels and New Yorkers' lives, but some of her efforts have shown the strain. A few weeks after her trip to North Africa, she condensed her visit to Tasselmante into the kind of story she loves, one with an unmistakable lesson for the women's organization she was addressing in Woodbury, Long Island. In her telling of the tale, the village women became considerably more self-sufficient than they actually were. ''As they walked me through this village that was in the desert, I was being proudly shown how for the first time because the women came together they had potable water,'' Clinton recalled, without mentioning the Japanese diesel or the man who held the key. Before reaching Woodbury on that rainy spring day, Clinton told another story. Speaking to a symposium on health care at Hofstra University, Clinton took as her text the need to restore trust in the health care system; her subtext was that she could be trusted to help do it. After noting that 43 million Americans lack health insurance -- including 3.1 million in New York alone'' -- Clinton dragged the subtext to the surface with a rare acknowledgment of failure. ''Some of you may recall that I had an idea or two about this topic back in 1993,'' she began, as a chuckle ran through the darkened hall. ''Now clearly that approach did not work, and we're not going to try that again, rest assured.'' But though she was discouraged, she said, she learned, and she could not give up. Clinton's voice softened, and she sounded almost humble. ''So I come from the school of smaller steps now, the belief that making smaller changes, incremental changes that will help some people, is better than walking away'' -- her voice rose in mockery and her hands came off the lectern as she spread her arms wide -- and saying it's an insoluble problem and there's nothing we can do about it.'' That is the story that Clinton's advisers believe she can use to convert the health care disaster into a selling point for a Senate race. It is about a woman who may have overstepped, but who did so because she cared so much about uninsured Americans. And while she has never stopped caring, she has learned her lesson about means. Sound familiar? You may recall that Bill Clinton has more than a few times presented himself as chastened and improved by failure. The health care story is largely true, though it elides the shock Hillary Clinton felt over the implosion of her plan. And it highlights only one lesson she learned, by attributing the outcome to how she handled health care reform rather than the fact that she handled it at all. Eleanor Roosevelt learned that lesson when she tried to serve in the Office of Civilian Defense. ''I could not take a Government position, even without salary or paid expenses,'' she wrote later, ''without giving ample opportunity for faultfinding to some members of the opposition in Congress and even to some of our own party people who disagreed with certain policies.'' To her dismay, Clinton came to believe that too. She concluded that the national press and the Washington political establishment were less accepting of an open role for her as her husband's adviser and advocate than their counterparts in Arkansas had been. In taking on health care, she had wanted to present herself as a nontraditional First Lady who wielded her influence in the open, not behind the scenes. She loved to be in the thick of policy debate, but she also saw herself as candidly serving her husband's interests. Literally, she thought of herself as acting as a lawyer for her client. And she failed him. ''I think it had a fundamental effect on their relationship,'' one of Hillary's friends says. ''She was like his good luck charm, and suddenly she wasn't good luck. And that was the role Dick played.'' Dick Morris, of course. Hillary Clinton reached out to Morris to salvage her husband's career after the 1994 elections, just as she had after he lost the governorship of Arkansas in 1980. Among Morris's first tasks the second time was to deliver some delicate news to the President about his wife. In his first polling for Clinton in late 1994, Morris recalls, he discovered that two-thirds of voters did not like aspects of him. They divided into two groups: the first group found him immoral; the other found him wishy-washy. That second group viewed Hillary Clinton as tremendously powerful. ''In effect, they believed that she was Example A of how weak he was,'' Morris says, ''and that their marriage was a zero-sum game, where the 100 points of power would be divided 60-40, 70-30, 50-50. But they didn't understand the idea that in a strong marriage between two strong people, their strength augments one another rather than robs one another. They just saw it as who wears the pants in the family.'' Morris showed the President the data and argued that voters wanted his wife to be not a policy maker but an advocate. The more she was seen in that role, Morris says he told the President, the less people would suspect she was privately running the show. First Advocate is essentially the path Hillary Clinton took. Although she was a key strategist throughout the 1992 campaign, she withdrew from the President's weekly political meetings during 1996. Like others in the White House, Leon Panetta, the chief of staff from 1994 to early 1997, concluded that she was going directly to the top, since the President would sometimes refer to his wife's thinking. Some senior White House officials in the second term could not recall being in a single policy discussion with her. ''I continued to work on all the issues I'd always worked on, including health care,'' Hillary Clinton told me. ''But I did not assume an additional title and a specific responsibility for an overall policy as I had before.'' To her, the shift in role made no sense, if what the public and pundits cared about was her accountability. When she was running the health care initiative, everyone knew what she was up to. Now, it seemed to her, nobody did. Invoking Eleanor Roosevelt's example, Morris urged Clinton to begin writing a weekly newspaper column, and she did. (Morris always used Eleanor to try to get Hillary to do what he wanted.) She also began writing a book. When it was published in 1996, while her husband was preoccupied with getting re-elected, ''It Takes a Village'' was viewed as a political makeover. For good reason. Clinton presents a gloriously sunny view of their family life and dwells on her role as a mother. But for all the image-polishing, it is a strikingly candid book, a manifesto that presents Clinton's worldview. ''Everywhere we look, children are under assault.'' That apocalyptic opinion is at the heart of ''It Takes A Village,'' and it is the animating belief behind most of her public work. It helps explain what is often seen as paradoxical and even hypocritical in Hillary Clinton: her peculiar blend of big-government liberalism and family-values traditionalism. Clinton scorns ''casual attitudes about divorce'' and suggests a mandatory ''cooling off'' period with ''education and counseling for partners.'' She writes that children should postpone sex until after 21 and that parents should ''reassert adult authority'' and also push prayer at home. And she argues that ''every society requires a critical mass of families that fit the traditional ideal.'' Those views are quite sincere for Clinton, who was reared in a cozy Chicago suburb, never rejected the Methodism she learned at Sunday school and passed on to her daughter and never rebelled against parents she adored. The book displays Clinton's liberal and interventionist impulses just as openly. She does not retreat from the willingness, even eagerness, to exert control that she displayed in drafting her 1,364-page health care proposal. She tells readers everything from what type of baby mattress to buy (firm and flat) to how much they should eat (''a sensible meat serving, for example, is about the size of a deck of cards''). She advocates universal health care and gun control, complains about the content of television news and violent video games, bemoans income inequality and approvingly quotes Alan Ehrenhalt's view that ''the unfettered free market has been the most radically disruptive force in American life in the last generation.'' If one accepts her dubious premise that American children are facing the greatest crisis in history and so need all available help, her conservative and interventionist appeals can be reconciled. ''At a time when the well-being of children is under unprecedented threat,'' she writes, ''the balance of power is weighted heavily against them.'' Clinton told me, extending this theme beyond the issue of children: ''We have to remain vigilant always against oppressive or abusive power, whether it comes from government or any other large unaccountable institution. And that's why I keep going back to my favorite word, which is balance. There has to be this balance that the founders were very smart to incorporate into our founding documents and our principles of self-government, but it has to be constantly revisited and revised, because we can so easily get out of balance.'' She does use the word ''balance'' an awful lot. She has for years. But while one can get her gist in the abstract, it is hard to tell what she means concretely, because Clinton has not tested her politics in campaign debate or legislative struggle. As First Lady, as in her book, she has had two luxuries that will vanish if she presents herself as a candidate: picking and choosing what issues she wants to address and falling back on exhortation rather than specific proposals to solve the problems she raises. Her record of passionate concern for children would surely give her great credibility on issues like gun violence in the schools, which after Littleton she is turning into a crusade. (''I have not stopped thinking about it,'' she told me.) But voters overall will expect precision that she has not had to display except about health care. When I asked her what specifically she hopes to accomplish as a senator or citizen, she began by replying, ''Well, you know, I'm concerned about a broad range of issues.'' Then she gathered speed. ''You know, much of what I care about falls into the broad categories of creating conditions for children to grow up and be healthy and well educated and productive citizens. And so that means I'm interested in everything from economic policy to education policy to adoption and foster care and welfare policy to health care.'' She laced her fingers together as she added, ''I think that all of these social, political, economic, cultural issues intersect.'' Clinton is widely viewed as more liberal than her husband, but there is not much evidence to support that. In Arkansas, it was Hillary who persuaded Bill to advocate the testing of public-school teachers. The efficacy of the test is debatable, but there is no question it angered some of their staunchest liberal supporters. ''The biggest mistake of the American press is thinking they know her,'' says Maggie Williams, Clinton's former chief of staff and one of her closest friends. ''You know, people think she's such a big lib. I think she's extremely conservative. I think she has more in common with people in upstate New York than in New York City, in a lot of ways.'' Williams calls Clinton ''patriotic and practical. She thinks it's important to spend money on social programs, but she wants to know that they work.'' Maybe so. But until she stands on her own politically, none of us can know. Morris says Hillary Clinton recognized long before her husband the effectiveness of a campaign based on bite-size ''values'' issues like school uniforms. She supports the death penalty, as the President does. She supports abortion rights, as he does, but she has not made the issue a priority as First Lady. For all her heated warnings about children, she has been ginger in using her influence to tilt the balance of power in their favor. On arguably the most important women's and children's legislation the President has endorsed -- welfare reform -- the First Lady was invisible. She says she was advising the President every step of the way and agreed with his decisions. On less dangerous subjects, Clinton has played her advocate's role more openly within the Administration. She surprised the President's men, for example, by urging them to consider the effect on child-support payments of bankruptcy legislation now before Congress. Without drawing attention to herself, she has lobbied Congress on issues like adoption. She made herself a driving force behind one of the biggest-ticket proposals of Clinton's second term, a $21.7 billion child-care initiative that has yet to win Congressional support. And, as she said at Hofstra, she never walked away from health care, but instead has doggedly coaxed along the President's incremental changes, including a $24 billion children's health insurance initiative. When it comes to children and health care, President Clinton goes out of his way to acknowledge his dependence on his wife. ''I'd also like to thank the First Lady, without whom I probably would not know very much about these issues,'' he said in the East Room recently, in a ceremony highlighting the new health care program. ''When I met her in 1971, she was already obsessed with them.'' Like the words, the body language emphasized her helpmate role. As the audience applauded, Hillary Clinton, seated on the podium to the President's right, stared down at the floor, seemingly abashed at all the attention. Then she looked back up at her husband. After Clinton stuck by her husband through the Lewinsky scandal, she came to present a fat target for those who found her wanting as a feminist. And it is hard not to wince these days over some things she says, at times so self-righteously. ''We can point to many problems around our world today where women -- for reasons of history, culture, discrimination, prejudice -- are used to lift up patriarchy, are used really as objects in order for others to exercise power,'' she said in commemorating International Women's Day this year. Clinton makes no apologies for her decisions last year. In the interview, she said at first that ''people have to make their own judgments about that,'' but then went on to suggest they had no business doing so. A bit paradoxically, she presented her actions as evidence of her independence and self-sufficiency. ''I would hope that young women -- women of all ages -- understand how important it is to live your own life according to your own values,'' she said, unspooling one of those lengthy sentences characteristic of either Clinton, ''and not be constantly looking over your shoulder to think what anybody else is thinking about you or saying about you, because ultimately, at the end of the day, you have to live with yourself and you have to do what you think is right. And again, my choices may not be someone else's choices.'' When it comes to the Clintons, it is hard to separate the personal and the political. Regardless of her feelings for him, leaving her husband last year would have brought down a Presidency she believes in to her bones. Some of the Clintons' closest associates have regarded their relationship for years as a partnership with staged shows of affection -- what they had to for the moment,'' as one of them put it to me. Even some of Hillary Clinton's friends wonder if she will stay with him after they leave the White House. But politics did not keep the Clintons together, according to other, closer friends of Hillary. She considered leaving him last year, they say, but her daughter and her marriage vows stopped her. Most important, they insist, she still loves him. ''She loves him, and she doesn't have to, but she does,'' one said. Part of the reason, this friend said, is their intellectual bond: ''Whether you think they're changing things for better or worse, they're always going to have something to say to each other about it.'' The scandal reversed the dynamic between them that prevailed after the health care fiasco. He had never needed her more, and she was never more potent as his loyal advocate. She was able to draw clear battle lines, with Kenneth Starr as her foe, and she relished going on the campaign trial for Democrats last fall. The Clintons still have bad days, their friends say. But privately, she speaks of him with deep admiration for his intelligence and political skills. While signs remain of iciness in their public appearances -- there are times when they barely exchange a glance on a shared podium -- the old patterns have reasserted themselves. At recent White House events, they have resumed finishing each other's sentences, and she has made her affectionate jokes at his expense. But maybe it is simply time to stop caring so much. Maybe it is time to leave wondering if the Clintons truly love each other to the historians and to focus on the accomplishments, failures and ideas that define his Presidency and would define her Senate race. If Clinton runs, she is likely to limit her husband's role, though he will try to meddle. Indeed, it has not escaped some of her friends that being forced onto the sidelines would be excruciating punishment for him, as, without a campaign of his own, he watches his wife and his Vice President run. But Hillary Clinton wants to find out what she can do on her own, they say. Further, having her husband front and center would make her look weak. And therein lies a delightful switch. For years, White House aides have praised Hillary Clinton's ability and contributions while in the next breath minimizing her influence in order to build up the President. Now, Hillary's allies are unself-consciously treating her husband the same way. ''She'd be a fool not to work with him very closely on this,'' one of them told me. ''It will, however, be Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign. It'll be her voice, and it'll be her persona. I see him playing very much a behind-the-scenes role.'' Hillary Clinton has developed a team of zealously loyal aides and outside advisers, some of whom have begun sounding out possible staff members in New York. Not surprisingly, the core members of Hillary Clinton's team are consultants that Clinton & Clinton have relied on in the past. They include Ickes, who ran Bill Clinton's campaign in New York in 1992; Mandy Grunwald, a former Clinton media strategist who worked on three Moynihan Senate races; Mark Penn, the President's pollster, and Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton friend and the party's pre-eminent finance man, who would help raise the $15 to $20 million Clinton would need. Others, including Hillary Clinton's friend Maggie Williams and the political strategist Michael Berman, are likely to play at least advisory roles. Some of Clinton's friends and advisers worry she may not have the physical strength for a Senate race. They wonder if her clothes are too muted, if she is too Midwestern and how she can possibly run behind velvet ropes and Secret Service guards. Most of all, they wonder if she can relax and handle the press with her humor rather than her hard edge. At a recent Clinton speech in Buffalo, I was yanked back when I tried to approach Clinton's rope line by an event organizer who apologetically explained that she was under White House orders to repel reporters. ''It has crossed my mind,'' Clinton said wryly, when I asked if she was worried about being attacked by her opponents and scrutinized by the press. ''But the possibility of partisan or political attacks does not serve as a deterrent. That is not anything that would prevent me'' -- and here she started laughing -- after having been through what we've been through, from deciding to run for office.'' Like a star quarterback at a pep rally, Hillary Clinton burst through the gym door at Buffalo State College to the shouts and whistles of 600 enraptured fans, most of them women. Wearing her usual uniform -- a dark pants suit and the blond helmet that ended her hair-style quest -- she strode to the center of the court with her usual grin, cheekbones soaring. ''Ask a Working Woman,'' read the purple and yellow sign over her left shoulder as she took her seat among five women who had been asked, Clinton explained, to come today in ''the clothes that they wear on the job.'' This town-hall meeting, earlier this month, provided a look at how Clinton would run for senator. It is a familiar look to anyone who has watched that other Clinton in action. For an hour, with a remote microphone and no notes, Clinton led the audience through a thicket of public-policy issues. She did not do boxers or briefs, but she went to similar lengths to relate to her crowd. When one woman said that not enough was being done to support two-parent families, Clinton tangentially recalled what she had written about the horror of divorce. ''I know that there are problems,'' she said. ''I mean, marriage is hard'' -- she began to grin as the crowd got it and started laughing -- it is hard work, and I'd be the first to tell ya.'' When the cheering stopped, she added, ''But when you have a child, you have a special obligation.'' The observation lightly reinforced a lesson Clinton's advisers believe Americans learned about the First Lady last year: she is a human being after all, one they can identify with. Another nightmare has become a tidy tale of personal growth and a selling point. For almost every speaker's problem, Clinton had a government solution, though they fell into a pattern: ''The policy that the President has proposed'' or ''Among the many proposals that the President has sent to Congress. . . .'' Summing up, she suggested that she would look to her husband to address issues discussed today. Then she began construction on one of her trademark transcontinental sentences, pounding together clause after clause down which, miraculously, subject, verb and object rattled to their point. The result was a kind of mission statement for Hillary Clinton. ''Now,'' she commenced, ''I think it would be a very good thing, not only for Buffalo or Erie County or New York but our whole country, for each of us to take a deep breath and think, You know, there but for the grace of God go I, and how can I try to help somebody else, how can I be an advocate for the kinds of things that working women and particularly single working moms or even stay-at-home moms or health care providers -- whatever -- how can I try to think of a way to make this community work as well as it can work?'' It is the all-encompassing ''whatever'' that captures the blurry scope of Hillary Clinton's waking dreams. And it is the next sentence -- a concluding, classically Clintonian pander -- that suggests how, and where, she wants to realize them: ''You know, ever since I first came to Buffalo when I was a young girl. . . .''", "headline": {"main": "The Next Clinton"}, "abstract": "James Bennet profile of Hillary Rodham Clinton as First Lady, potential senator from New York and Clintonian; holds she did not sacrifice her ambition to her husband's so much as yoke them together and regards his accomplishments as hers too; notes Pres Clinton has depended on her to achieve power, keep it and figure out how to use it; she comments, interview; photos (L)", "print_page": "23", "word_count": 8407, "_id": "4fd1ea328eb7c8105d739b37", "snippet": "On the windy Friday in February that the Senate acquitted her husband of perjury and obstruction of justice, Hillary Rodham Clinton turned her attention to her life after his Presidency.
