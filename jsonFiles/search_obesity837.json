In realms as disparate as breast cancer, menopause, arthritis and weight control, the prevailing orthodoxy finds itself under attack. For the past several months a controversy has raged over whether mammograms to detect tiny tumors in the breast have any proven value in reducing breast cancer mortality. Last week a federal study of hormone pills to treat postmenopausal women for a wide range of ailments was terminated when prolonged use of the pills was found to do more harm than good. A day or so later researchers reported that a popular operation for arthritis of the knee worked no better than a sham procedure that left patients thinking they had received treatment when in fact they had not. In all of these cases, the issue was whether commonplace medical practices were able to prove their worth in carefully controlled clinical studies. A common long-term hormone replacement therapy and arthroscopic surgery for arthritis of the knee failed that test. Mammography's value remains in dispute.", "snippet": "These have not been good times for established medical practices.
