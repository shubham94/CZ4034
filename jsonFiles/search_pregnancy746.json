Federal support for the wishful abstinence-only approach, which began in the 1980s, ballooned during George W. Bush's presidency. As the funding grew, so did evidence of the policy's failure. A Congressionally mandated study released in 2007 found that elementary and middle school students who received abstinence instruction were just as likely to have sex in the following year as students who did not get such instruction.", "headline": {"main": "End to the Abstinence-Only Fantasy", "kicker": "EDITORIAL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": 376, "_id":
