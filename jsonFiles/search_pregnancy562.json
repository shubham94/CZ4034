Writing in The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis said that this martial arts drama from the Chinese director Zhang Yimou, set in A.D. 928, ''achieves a kind of operatic delirium, opening the floodgates of image and melodrama until the line between tragedy and black comedy is all but erased.'' She added: ''Since his debut in 1987 with 'Red Sorghum' Mr. Zhang has made more controlled films but never one that's more fun. With 'Curse of the Golden Flower' he aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann. And a good thing too.'' 6 A.M.

Viggo Mortensen is the hippie salesman who turns her life upside down in 1969, as the moon walk and Woodstock loom.
