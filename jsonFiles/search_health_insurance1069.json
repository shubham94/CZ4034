{"status": "OK", "response": {"docs": [{"type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Classified", "lead_paragraph": "NETTER--Edward. Edward Netter, age 78, of Greenwich, CT and Montecito, CA, a distinguished philanthropist and business leader, passed peacefully at his home on February 16, 2011. By his side were his beloved wife of 56 years, Barbara, their daughter and son-in-law, Vicki and Bill Fitzgerald, their son, Don, daughter-in-law, Stephanie, and granddaughters, Arianna Nell (4) and Samantha Charli (2), who will forever keep \"Gramps\" in their prayers. Edward was raised in Scarsdale, NY, and following his marriage to Barbara, settled in Larchmont, NY before moving to Greenwich in 1979. Edward began his business career following graduation from the University of Pennsylvania in 1953; he joined and then became a partner of Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt, a prominent investment banking firm in New York City which evolved into Shearson Loeb Rhoades. Edward's seminal writings on what was referred to as \"surplus, surplus\" or \"redundant capital\" helped transform the fire and casualty insurance industry by demonstrating how companies could unlock value for all stockholders. Edward became legendary as one of the architects of the modern-day financial services holding company wherein varieties of investment products (e.g. mutual funds, insurance, business services, banking, etc.) are amalgamated under a common entity, and his ideas spawned many eminent transactions. Edward went on to devote his unsurpassed combination of intellect, creativity and stamina as founder of Netter International, Ltd. in 1971, and then as Chairman of its successor, Geneve Corporation, a financial services holding company that has controlling interests in numerous prominent public and private businesses which straddle the financial, distribution and manufacturing worlds principally in the insurance and education sectors, including Independence Holding Company, American Independence Corp., The Aristotle Corporation, Standard Security Life Insurance Company of New York, Madison National Life Insurance Company, Independence American Insurance Company and Southern Life and Health Insurance Company. In 2006, Edward was inducted into the Business Leader Hall of Fame at the Quinnipiac University School of Business, Hamden, CT for his enduring contribution to business through extraordinary leadership. A significant philanthropist through much of his life, Edward donated his time, knowledge and resources to many charities concentrated principally on science, education and human services, including those in the local communities of Greenwich and Montecito. Edward and Barbara have provided visionary leadership to the Barbara and Edward Netter Center for Community Partnerships at the University of Pennsylvania, whose mission, through a virtual classroom, is to provide the broad range of knowledge needed to solve the complex, comprehensive and interconnected problems of the American city. Edward was also an active trustee of Thanks to Scandinavia in New York City and a respected participant of The Greenwich Roundtable. Edward was a longtime member of The Harmonie Club in New York City, Beach Point Club in Mamaroneck, NY, and Burnham Wood Golf Club in Montecito, CA. He was an enthusiast of classical music, jazz and dance, and an accomplished competitive bridge player; he enjoyed collecting cartoons and sending them to his family, colleagues and friends; and he was a voracious reader, a student of finance, science, education and politics, an avid swimmer and tennis player, and a proud grandfather. Despite his vast accomplishments, Edward was a private man, of great humility, kindness and compassion, and always delighted in lending his talents as a mentor to assist others achieve their best. Perhaps Edward's finest achievement was his most recent---the extension of his innovative business principles and financial resources to visionary philanthropy in the form of Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy (ACGT). The courageous 11-year battle against breast cancer of their first daughter-in-law, Kimberly Lawrence-Netter, inspired Edward and Barbara to found ACGT in 2001 as the only public charity focused exclusively on cell and gene therapy research, which is widely believed to be the next significant key to the development of effective and safe treatments of all types of cancer. With 100% of contributions going directly to science, and a 17-member Scientific Advisory Council composed exclusively of pre-eminent doctors and academics in the field of cell and gene therapy, ACGT has made grants of more than $22 million to pioneering investigators at 27 renowned U.S. research institutions; and there are currently 17 ongoing clinical trials based on ACGT's sponsorship. The members of the Netter family are thankful to those dedicated and talented colleagues in the business and philanthropic communities, as well as their numerous dear friends, who have made Edward's extraordinary journey so exciting and rewarding. Funeral services will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York, NY at 11:30am on Wednesday, February 23, 2011. In lieu of flowers, donations in Edward's memory will be gratefully appreciated by Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy at www.acgtfoundation.org.", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  NETTER, EDWARD"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": 773, "_id": "4fd2b8168eb7c8105d8ad646", "snippet": "NETTER--Edward.
