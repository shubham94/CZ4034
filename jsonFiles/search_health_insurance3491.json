This wasn't quite as incongruous as it sounds: the political movement that eventually imposed apartheid had strong populist, even socialist roots. It was sincerely concerned with improving the economic status of the Afrikaner worker, and protecting him from the depredations of international capital. Unfortunately, the movement improved the lot of white labor mainly by preventing capitalists from offering industrial jobs to nonwhites, whose intense poverty made them willing to work for less. The U.S. labor movement is not as brutally direct in its slogans. Probably its leaders don't even admit to themselves that their increasingly vociferous opposition to imports is, in effect, an effort to improve the condition of American workers by denying opportunity to workers in the rest of the world. But when the Teamsters' president, James P. Hoffa, declares, as he did on this page not long ago, that ''American workers should not be asked to compete with foreigners who are not paid a living wage,'' the implications are clear. Given the low productivity of workers in third-world countries, their nations' lack of infrastructure and general lag in development, to insist that such workers be paid what Americans would regard as a living wage is to insist that they price themselves out of their jobs. And that is no accident: any policy that didn't price those workers out of the market would offer no relief to workers here.", "headline": {"main": "Workers vs. Workers", "kicker": "RECKONINGS"}, "abstract": "Paul Krugman Op-Ed column sees United States labor movement's opposition to imports as effort to improve condition of American workers by denying opportunity to workers in rest of world (M)", "print_page": "17", "word_count": 731, "_id": "4fd2135a8eb7c8105d78a6b8", "snippet": "In the 1920's, South Africa's Communist Party campaigned under the slogan ''Workers of the world unite for a white South Africa!''
