Ms. Echeverri, the singer from the Colombian band Aterciopelados, wrote the songs during her pregnancy and after the birth of her daughter, Milagros. The music has the sly lilt and electronic fringes of the Latin lounge-pop she sings with Aterciopelados, while the lyrics, in Spanish, are filled with maternal love, wonderment and unabashed observations of the changes in her own body. ''Ya Yo No'' marvels that ''I'' has changed to ''we''; ''A Eme O'' celebrates her reawakened lust; and ''Lactochampeta'' -- amid chirps and whistles -- savors nursing: ''Satisfy all your appetites with me, baby.'' Rarely has motherhood sounded so blithe or so sexy. Earth From 1992 to 1996, a Seattle band called Earth released five albums of droning, sludgy, largely instrumental rock that was something like grunge's slowed-down answer to Sonic Youth; it was also a precursor to bands from Kyuss to Sigur Ros. Among their relatively few fans were musicians, and ''Legacy of Dissolution'' (No Quarter) set loose some of them to remix Earth songs. Mogwai remakes ''Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine'' with new electronics flickering and looping around Earth's tolling guitars; Jim O'Rourke savors the minimalistic sustain of ''Thrones and Dominions.'' All six remixers are surprisingly reverent about the originals, which, indeed, are hard to top. But they should draw attention to an album that Earth's founder, Dylan Carlson, plans to start recording next month. The Kills Rock duos have lost their novelty lately, but they haven't stopped making lean, memorable music. The Kills' new album, ''No Wow'' (Rough Trade) is nearly as stripped down as its title. VV ( aka Alison Mosshart), who sings and plays guitar, and Hotel (Jamie Hince), who sings backup and plays guitar, bass and drums, do allow themselves some overdubs and drum-machine assistance. Yet they keep the songs pithy, putting two or three frazzled chords behind instant mottos like ''I hate the way you love.'' For all that the Kills owe to P.J. Harvey, they also have angles of their own. El Pus Rap-rock makes a sidelong comeback by way of this Atlanta band, which is pronounced El POOSE, but, luckily, has few other pretensions. It's not the self-pitying rap-rock of late-1990's metal bands. El Pus's songs on the album ''Hoodlum Rock: Vol. 1'' (Virgin) are closer to punk-pop and the rock forays of OutKast and N.E.R.D. They have a sense of humor that applies equally to would-be thugs and their own sexual conquests or lack thereof. Rare is the rapper -- or rocker -- who'd set out to pick up women with Radiohead's '''Kid A' in the beatbox,'' or admit it afterward. Heartless Bastards When Erika Wennerstrom announces ''I'm gonna take everything, everything!'' on the Heartless Bastards' debut album ''Stairs and Elevators'' (Fat Possum), the raw quaver in her untamed voice gives her as much bite as the distortion on her guitar. Bravado runs through her songs, which drag midtempo British rock -- from the Kinks to Bowie to Oasis -- into a grimy American garage. Between her constant fuzz-tone and her burly two-man rhythm section, the album as a whole grows one-dimensional. But before it does, Ms. Wennerstrom leaves a vivid impression. Sam Prekop Seconds into the first track of Sam Prekop's album ''Who's Your New Professor'' (Thrill Jockey), folky guitar picking is enveloped in burbling synthesizer and rustling jazz drums. That mutability of styles runs through this quietly ambitious album. Mr. Prekop is a decidedly modest singer, which makes him right for lyrics full of uncertainties and could-have-beens: ''Gotta know for sure, don't I?'' His songs ruminate amid folk and bossa nova, hovering guitar patterns and hazy jazz trumpets. They're amiable and elusive, drifting at will. Jack Johnson Recorded mostly with just acoustic guitar, bass, drums and Jack Johnson's breathy voice, the songs on ''In Between Dreams'' (Universal) are so light and self-effacing they might scatter in a tropical breeze. As Mr. Johnson vamps pleasantly, he tries to ponder mortality and ethics along with romance, aiming for something as intimate as Nick Drake minus the inner torment. But without the torment, well . . . here comes that breeze. --", "headline": {"main": "The Sexy Sounds Of Childbearing", "kicker": "MUSIC: PLAYLIST"}, "abstract": "John Pareles reviews new recordings by Andrea Echeverri, Earth, The Kills, El Pus, Heartless Bastards, Sam Prekop and Jack Johnson; photos (M)", "print_page": "29", "word_count": 707, "_id": "4fd283a18eb7c8105d852053", "snippet": "Andrea Echeverri sings about motherhood in her first solo album; also, Sam Prekop, El Pus, Earth, the Kills and more.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/13/arts/music/13Play.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "JOHNSON, JACK"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ECHEVERRI, ANDREA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "PREKOP, SAM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "HEARTLESS BASTARDS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "EL PUS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "EARTH"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "KILLS, THE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ATERCIOPELADOS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ROCK MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDINGS (AUDIO)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Jon", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Pareles"}], "original": "By Jon Pareles"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-03-13T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Women in New York City are more likely to be obese and less likely to exercise than men, which increases their risk of heart disease, diabetes and other ailments that can cut lives short, according to a report to be issued today by the city's Health Department.
