In ''False Alarm,'' Siegel, a doctor and associate professor at the New York University School of Medicine, says we waste a lot of energy and money being disproportionately afraid of terrorists, hurricanes, anthrax, SARS and so on. The notion that the most serious death threats, like obesity, often get the least attention isn't new; David Ropeik and George Gray explored it more thoroughly three years ago in their guide, ''Risk.''

A1 U.S. General on Rebuilding Iraq An American general who commanded 38,000 soldiers in the securing and rebuilding of Baghdad writes in a new essay that success in Iraq cannot be achieved solely by training local security forces. Instead, he says, the military must also work to provide essential city services, create jobs and promote local governmental control. A5 Youth React to Pope's Speech At the Mass of World Youth Day, Pope Benedict XVI seemed to enjoy himself as he made strides on this first trip abroad in defining his papacy. But the emotional charge that Catholics became accustomed to from 26 years of Pope John Paul II, scores of young people said, was less evident in this less extroverted, more cerebral pope.

A11 Split Over Confirmation Tactics Before senators begin questioning the Supreme Court nominee, John G. Roberts Jr., the debate over his confirmation is becoming a test of Senate Democrats as well. The party's liberal base is pressing for a vigorous fight against Judge Roberts as documents from the Reagan administration clarify his conservative credentials. But some Democrats are reluctant to join in on the criticism of his record. A8 Tribute for Hunter S. Thompson Hunter S. Thompson's cremated remains were blasted into the sky over his farm in Colorado, boosted by red, blue and silver fireworks around a 153-foot monument that Mr. Thompson, the writer and avatar of ''gonzo'' journalism, designed himself almost 30 years ago. A8 Accusations at U.S.O. Just as the U.S.O is increasing efforts to support soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, it has been roiled by internal concerns over its management practices.

C1 Educational Software Fades Sales of educational software -- a category that includes programs teaching math, reading and other subjects as well as reference works like encyclopedias -- has plummeted, now that free games and learning sites now available all over the Internet. C1 Soda Policy Criticized When the American Beverage Association announced a new policy curbing sales of sodas in schools the soft drink industry billed the move as a bold new plan to address the problem of childhood obesity. But critics see it more as a clever marketing ploy than a noble attempt to protect children. C1 Corporate Alliance Tested Conrad M. Black and F.
