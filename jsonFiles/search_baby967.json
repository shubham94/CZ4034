The $29.5 billion budget provides millions of dollars for longer library hours, health clinics for the poor and other welfare programs. It is based on a projection of the city's economic future that is more optimistic than either of the Mayor's previous budgets, reflecting a slight rise in the city's tax revenues. It also assumes $115 million in new taxes that the Mayor and the City Council support but that officials acknowledged may face trouble in the State Legislature. A1. CUNY ADOPTS TOUGHER STANDARDS In its sharpest change of direction since adopting open admissions in 1970, the City University of New York yesterday approved a broad plan to tighten educational requirements over the next decade. Although open admissions will be retained, students will have to have taken college-preparatory courses in high school or take extra courses at the university before getting their degree. The program will likely lead to major changes in many of the city's public high schools. University trustees also improves a tuition increase. A1. FIFTH DEATH IN PARK CRASH Bryant Fonseca turned 20 on Saturday.

REGION A PLAN TO SELL CITY HALL Short of cash? Why not sell City Hall? That, in effect, is what the Suffolk County Legislature will be considering today. As a way to raise a quick $25 million, Suffolk wants to sell its most prominent government building to a newly created public trust, which would then lease it back to the county. Most Democrats and Republicans, say they can support the concept, which has been used at the state and county level from New York to California. B5. HELP FOR MILITARY CONTRACTORS Saying New York State had lost more than 65,000 jobs since 1987 because of cutbacks in Pentagon spending, Governor Cuomo visited an electronics company here to announce a state program to help military contractors find customers in private industry.

The Mayor's proposal that each Medicaid patient have a personal doctor sounded to her like the way care is already provided at the Ryan center, where she has been going for nearly five years. The Dinkins administration's plan to eventually provide every poor person in the city with a family doctor is not new. The concept has been discussed for decades in New York and around the country as the ideal approach to preventive health care. Similarly, the plan, known as managed care, is not untried.
