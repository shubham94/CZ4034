While many states have moved forward with consumer protection laws aimed at health maintenance organizations, the sweep of the California legislation contained in 21 bills, along with similarly broad legislation in Texas, sets an important standard by which to judge national reform. The most controversial piece of the California package would allow patients to sue managed care plans for compensatory and punitive damages if the patient was substantially harmed by a health plan's action to deny, delay or modify necessary medical care. The barrier to suing would be high -- lawsuits would be allowed only when a patient could show that he had suffered significant harm or significant financial loss. But the law does not limit the amount of recovery for those losses.", "headline": {"main": "Health Care Reforms in California"}, "abstract": "Editorial praises California for leading the nation in addressing the need for managed care regulation and for giving patients the right to sue managed care plans for compensatory and punitive damages if they are substantially harmed by plan actions; says state initiatives do not replace the need for Federal legislation (M)", "print_page": "24", "word_count": 510, "_id": "4fd214ab8eb7c8105d78d23c", "snippet": "The enactment of new health care reforms in California shows that state leaders are well ahead of Congress in addressing the need for managed care regulation.
