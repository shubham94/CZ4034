The agreement is expected to alter the nation's legal, regulatory and public health landscape permanently. Among other changes, the proposed settlement would require cigarette companies to pay $368.5 billion over the next 25 years to compensate states for the costs of treating smoking-related illness, to finance nationwide anti- smoking programs and to underwrite health care for millions of uninsured children. The text was downloaded from the Web site at http://stic.neu.edu run by the State Tobacco Information Center, an information clearing house created to provide information for the public and attorneys general involved in the case. Preamble This legislation would mandate a total reformation and restructuring of how tobacco products are manufactured, marketed and distributed in this country. The nation can thereby see real and swift progress in preventing underage use of tobacco, addressing the adverse health effects of tobacco use and changing the corporate culture of the tobacco industry.", "headline": {"main": "Excerpts From Agreement Between States and Tobacco Industry"}, "abstract": "Excerpts from proposal for settlement reached by tobacco industry representatives, group of state attorneys general and plaintiffs' lawyers (L)", "print_page": "8", "word_count": 7991, "_id": "4fd1de568eb7c8105d72200b", "snippet": "Following are excerpts from the proposal for a settlement reached last Friday by tobacco industry representatives, a group of state attorneys general and plaintiffs' lawyers.
