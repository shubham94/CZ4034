Whether viewed as an affliction of the body or the mind, fat is apparently an intractable problem. ''We still have no idea how to make fat people thin,'' Paul Campos writes in THE OBESITY MYTH: Why America's Obsession With Weight Is Hazardous to Your Health (Gotham, $25), pronouncing heraldically that ''tolerance toward an almost wholly benign form of human diversity is the least we should expect of ourselves.'' We don't tolerate it, however, if this new shelf of books can be believed. We can't be fat; we must be fat. This pathos of American abundance works wonderfully in memoir, and some of these falsely triumphant books are stirring and even enlightening, bad faith being of course a central element of weight control, with all its cheating and black-is-slimming and cloaking of vanity in moral terms.", "snippet": "WHICH is the more expedient solution, the one that will produce greater happiness -- becoming thin; or deciding, through rarefied cultural perspective, that being thin doesn't matter?
