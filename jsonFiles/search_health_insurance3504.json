But state authorities have dawdled over its application to convert to for-profit status for nearly four years, and the Legislature threatens to exit Albany without approving Empire's request. Empire used to be the only insurer to extend coverage to all individual applicants -- those not covered through employers -- at rates that did not depend on the applicant's medical condition. But since 1996, the state has required every managed care plan to enroll individuals. Empire's special role ceased. The only way to preserve Empire's contribution to the uninsured is to approve the conversion. Empire would turn over all of its stock, worth perhaps $600 million, to an independent foundation. The foundation would later sell the stock, using the proceeds to help extend coverage to the uninsured. Empire would then issue new stock to pay for the information systems and other hugely expensive investments that are needed to match those of for-profit plans.", "headline": {"main": "Health Tasks Before the Legislature; A Transfusion for Empire"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "28", "word_count": 243, "_id": "4fd1fa5c8eb7c8105d75812b", "snippet": "Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the largest health insurer in New York State, cannot earn enough money to survive if it remains a nonprofit company.
