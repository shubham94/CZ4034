Douglas Bernard Kirby, PhD, a senior research scientist at ETR Associates and a pillar in the field of adolescent sexual and reproductive health, died of a heart attack on Saturday, December 22, 2012 while climbing Cotopaxi in Ecuador. Dr. Kirby was one of the world's leading experts on school and community programs to reduce sexual risk taking, and dedicated his career to promoting sexual and reproductive health among young people through his writing, teaching, and research. He authored over 150 articles, chapters and monographs on these programs, and frequently spoke nationally and internationally on his work. He served as a scientific adviser to the CDC, USAID, WHO, UNFPA, UNESCO, and the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. Dr. Kirby's most recent work focused on helping countries ravaged by HIV to strengthen their prevention education efforts through developing more impactful educational programs. Over the past year, Dr. Kirby delivered trainings for Ministries of Education, Ministries of Health and non-governmental organizations from over a dozen southern and eastern African countries on designing effective programs. Dr. Kirby was a passionate professional who was incredibly generous with his time--answering inquiries from research colleagues, policy-makers, and students with thought and depth. He was also a caring human being who took the time to build relationships, show concern, and share his support no matter how overwhelmed or busy he was in his professional life. One of Dr. Kirby's goals in life was to help make the world a better place--he achieved that goal and more. Dr. Douglas Kirby will always hold a position of influence in the field of sexual and reproductive health and will continue to serve as an inspiration to others in the field for years to come.
