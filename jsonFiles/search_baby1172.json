She thrilled us all with her stirring rendition of 'God Bless America' and sang with a passion which left few eyes dry.'' Miss Smith had been in poor health since 1976, when she suffered brain damage as a result of a diabetic coma. In January, her right leg was amputated because of circulatory problems associated with her diabetes, and on May 9, she underwent a mastectomy.", "headline": {"main": "KATE SMITH, ALL-AMERICAN SINGER, DIES AT 79"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1812, "_id": "4fd154fb8eb7c8105d638b6b", "snippet": "Kate Smith, whose vibrant voice made ''God Bless America'' an unofficial national anthem and was one of the most popular singers of the century, died yesterday afternoon at Raleigh (N.C.)

A plumber who lives on the barrier beach needs to have his blood pressure checked. A woman vacationing with her young son in Ocean Beach is worried about bug bites. They all wind up on the doorstep of the Nurse by the Sea. As the only practicing nurse on Fire Island year-round, 33-year-old Janet LaViolette of Ocean Beach said: ''I'm doing something kind of different. Nurses usually don't go out on their own setting up their own practice. They collaborate with a doctor.'' But living on an island that is accessible only by boats and authorized vehicles, and where only one doctor practices year-round, has caused Miss LaViolette, a former school nurse, to explore a new direction in nursing. She says she now believes that a nurse can do outreach and community work. ''It's just a matter of educating the public,'' she said. ''I consider what I do a service.''", "headline": {"main": "LONG ISLAND JOURNAL"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 1488, "_id": "4fd15d0f8eb7c8105d64455b", "snippet": "THE NURSE BY THE SEA - A gardener on Fire Island breaks out in hives.
