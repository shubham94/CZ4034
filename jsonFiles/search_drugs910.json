There was a time not too long ago, the 39-year-old Lippin said cheerfully, when the mere thought of crossing that bridge in an automobile filled her with extreme dread, a physiological immersion in fear most of us can only imagine. ''Somehow I figured out how to get the phone number of the 24-hour control booth for the bridge,'' she said, still dismayed by the depth of her anxiety and embarrassed about the ingenuity it inspired. Lippin -- a mother of two, a lawyer and now a Manhattan therapist who treats people with phobias -- recalled the lengths to which she used to go to avoid getting stuck in traffic on the bridge. ''I would call them, and I'd say, 'I know this sounds crazy, but I'm in a car and I'm anxious about crossing the bridge in traffic and want to know if it's clear or not.'
