For one thing, major social welfare legislation seems to run in a three-decade cycle. Medicare was created 30 years ago, Social Security 30 years before that. Then in 1991, a long-shot candidate, Harris Wofford, won a Senate election in Pennsylvania by running on health care. Republicans got the hint. At the start of the 1992 campaign year, President George Bush promised a \"comprehensive health reform program.\" But then Mr. Bush's natural passivity kicked in. White House interest faded, handing Bill Clinton the issue that became the centerpiece of his campaign. It is also the issue that may well determine whether Mr. Clinton's is remembered as a notable Presidency. One reasons is that universal health care has been both a crying national need and a potently divisive social and legislative issue for a long time. The American Medical Association used the specter of \"Socialized medicine\" to defeat Harry S. Truman's plan for national health insurance in 1945. The same demagoguery still works, but that does not change the agreed facts. Health care consumes one-seventh of the gross national product, far more than what other industrialized democracies spend to extend health care to all their citizens. Even so, the U.S. system leaves 37 million people without health insurance. And while American who can afford it get the best care in the world, the current system makes little sense in terms of economic competitiveness or social equity. It is possible to study the problem and come up with a number of solutions, including, for example, a Government financed, or single-payer, system like Canada's. The Times's editorial page has advocated the managed competition model, which borrows the mandatory participation feature of government programs -- guaranteeing that everyone is covered -- but relies on carefully structured competition between private plans to deliver health care. Mr. Clinton deserves credit for specifying universal coverage with private insurance as the anchors of his plan. By so doing, he set the boundaries for the ideological debate. The legislative struggle now under way has to do with how much of the Clinton ideology will survive and also with the architecture and mechanics of the new system. Although Mr. Clinton has shaped the debate in a positive way, the White House team has made tactical mistakes. The most serious was its decision to draft its health care proposal in secret sessions presided over by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Ira Magaziner. The lack of public hearings wasted a opportunity to build public support and increase the pressure on Congress to respond to public need rather than the health care lobbyists. The task force wound up alienating many of the experts that Mrs. Clinton gathered in the White House to create policy. They saw virtually no imprint of their work on the bill that the First Lady's inner circle put together. Another tactical misstep was to send to Capitol Hill a 1,300-page mega-bill that purports to solve every medical problem the country has ever experienced. A tighter bill would have been a tougher target for critics to hit. Political necessity also warped the Clinton plan when the task force decided to propose only those reforms that would not require a broad-based tax. That single decision shaped virtually every feature of the reform, from the controversial purchasing alliances to cost controls, and produced a bill that many in Congress have declared unworkable. These missteps made the job of the Democratic Congressional leaders immeasurably harder. They weren't helped by Republicans like the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, who characterized the Clinton effort as \"A massive overdose of Government control.\" But other Republicans, like Senators John Chafee and John Danfoth, have struggled to find a consensus plan. Until the past few weeks, the White House vacillated between trying to ram a bill through Congress with a slim majority of Democratic votes and reaching for a bipartisan compromise. When Senator Edward M. Kennedy received President and Mrs. Clinton's blessing for his modified version of their plan, that was an important signal. It meant that the season of bipartisan bargaining had begun. June is the critical month. If the committees do not finish most of their work this month, Congress will run out of time before the lawmakers break for the November elections and the entire effort could collapse. Whatever the flaws in the process of writing the bill or in the bill itself, the Clinton health reform has now created a sene of urgency on the Hill. And by assigning his wife to lead the effort, Mr. Clinton made a pact not to ditch health care reform no matter how tought the fight. For him, the real test of success will be coming away with some viable form of universal coverage. Then he can take credit for a landmark achievement in social policy that will earn him a place in history no matter what else occurs in his tenure.", "headline": {"main": "Down to Cases"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 829, "_id": "4fd1ebd68eb7c8105d73c3f0", "snippet": "It did not take a psychic to know that the time was ripe for health care reform.
