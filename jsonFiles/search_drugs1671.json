The analysts suggest that the highly touted gains in ''survival rates'' among cancer patients in recent years are partly, or perhaps even largely, a statistical mirage, caused more by changes in the way cancer is detected and defined than by any real gains in the ability of doctors to cure cancer once it is detected. However, leaders of the nation's cancer research and treatment establishment dismiss the criticism as the undocumented assertions of analysts who do not fully understand the latest advances in the clinical detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

It was carried out under a law passed by Congress in 1962 that required drug manufacturers to prove their prescription medicines were effective. The review, which consumed much money and energy at the agency, has left the consumer groups who pressed for it satisfied that prescription medicines available in pharmacies work, although there are complaints that the study took too long. Why It Lasted 22 Years When asked why the review had taken so long, Dr. Robert J. Temple, an F.D.A. official, said the Government wanted to avoid depriving consumers of needed prescription drugs.
