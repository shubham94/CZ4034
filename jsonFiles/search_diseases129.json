We, at the Mount Sinai Health System, are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend and longtime colleague, J. Lester Gabrilove, MD, one of the most beloved and outstanding physicians in the history of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Gabrilove, considered one of the fathers of modern endocrinology, greatly advanced the study of endocrinology during a career that spanned more than 70 years. He co-authored \"The Human Adrenal Gland\" and \"Diseases of the Endocrine Glands;\" published more than 170 papers in national and international journals; and impacted generations of faculty and trainees. He was a role model who inspired numerous endocrine fellows and faculty who regarded him as a master clinician-educator. Dr. Gabrilove served as Chief of the Endocrine Clinic at The Mount Sinai Hospital for 20 years, and was instrumental in founding the Clinic as well as the Division of Endocrinology, where he also served as Acting Chief. In 2007, the division was renamed the Hilda and J. Lester Gabrilove Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Disease in honor of Dr. Gabrilove and his wife. In 1995, in recognition of his lifelong contributions, he received the inaugural Distinguished Endocrinologist Award by the American College of Endocrinology. His inquiring mind--he published his last paper in his nineties--combined with his passion to advance clinical care, was a gift to his patients and the School of Medicine. We extend our deepest condolences to his daughter, Janice L. Gabrilove, MD, the James F. Holland Professor of Medicine (Hematology and Medical Oncology), and Professor of Oncological Sciences, at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; his son-in-law, Michael Dirzulaitis; and his two grandsons, Mark and Matthew, of whom he was very proud.
