While the American dollar plunged last week to post-World War II lows against the yen, frustrations grew in Japan as hopes for a bright recovery there faced away. In Tokyo, Japanese protesters -- some in animal suits -- blamed the United States for pushing up the yen. HEALTH CARE It's Raining Mergers The way health care companies are pairing two by two, you'd think the Flood were coming tomorrow. Last week -- in the second billion-dollar consolidation of home health care companies in 60 days -- Coram Healthcare agreed to buy Lincare Holdings for about $1.38 billion. On March 2, Abbey Healthcare Group and Homedco Group had announced plans for a $1 billion merger, themselves. The Coram half of soon-to-be Coram-Lincare was itself born of a four-way merger just last year. One analyst indicated the home health care business would, indeed, flood Coram-Lincare and Abbey-Homedco -- with money. She estimated that they would each command about 17 percent of the industry's $7 billion market next year. COPING Japanese Companies on Guard Fearing a relapse into recession, several Japanese companies -- Mazda Motor, Mitsubishi Materials and Sumitomo Metal Industries are included -- have announced austerity plans. Big companies, at least, seem highly capable of coping with the export-threatening rise of the yen. But the Japanese economy might not fare as well. Indeed, analysts indicated last week, the country's lifetime employment system may be in jeopardy. ARMS CONTRACTORS A Moveable, Affordable Feast Georgia's in. Washington's out. Where costs are low, military hardware manufacturing plants are bustling. Where costs are higher, wildflowers are growing around shuttered plants of the same sort. It's as if military contractors are collectively moving the party -- albeit a smaller, post-Reagan affair -- to any location where the tab will be most easily digested. Also on the in list: Colorado, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi. In some cases, the companies are even seeking what economists say are gifts of public goods like roads, schools and municipal airports -- and getting them. Georgia's Cobb County, for example, is about to pay for a multimillion-dollar rail underpass to give a warm welcome to Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest arms contractor. WEALTH The Divided States of America Picture a classroom of third-graders herded into two groups. Less than a quarter of them are sporting Hanna Andersson all-cotton separates. The rest are draped in itchy, ill-sized hand-me-downs. Hands on hearts, they chant, \"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands: one nation, under God, economically divisible . . . .\" This amendment to the egalitarian pledge seems fitting: New studies were shown to establish last week that America has become the most economically stratified of industrial nations. A very few possess much of the wealth. And, as a Brookings Institution fellow pointed out, because political campaigns in America are ruled by money, the financial extremes could well intensify. (In what could become a kind of reverse-Robin Hood legend, Republicans today are seeking cuts in Federal welfare programs and taxes.) And the country as a whole may end up suffering right along with those poorly dressed third-graders: One economics expert asserted that America, with a child poverty rate four times the average of its principal industrial competitors', could find itself at a big competitive disadvantage by the time today's children join the work force. AUTOS Mini-van Monday? If the audacious billionaire Kirk Kerkorian succeeds in buying Chrysler -- mind you, this is a big if -- and the auto maker is left heavily in debt as a result, analysts believe the bottom lines of shareholders, along with mini-van buyers, would be affected. The analysts point to Philip Morris scrambling to cut Marlboro cigarette prices two years ago in an effort to stem the loss of sales to lower-priced competitors. Chrysler, it follows, would be forced to cut prices because with the debt on its books, \"Ford and G.M. would have a field day\" going after its product lines, said the automotive stock analyst Nicholas Lobaccaro. After Philip Morris announced its cut, the company suffered a sharp selloff that left its shareholders $13 billion poorer. With Chrysler, Mr. Lobaccaro predicted, instead of a Marlboro Friday, \"you would have a mini-van Monday.\" WALL STREET Salomon Is Still Bleeding Somebody get Salomon Brothers a tourniquet! Since a pay plan cutting the compensation of its managing directors was announced late last year, the investment bank has lost 10 percent of those directors. Three were added to the list last week -- even as the firm, which reported 1994 after-tax losses of almost $400 million, announced an easing of the restrictive pay plan. Analysts were skeptical about how effective the new plan would be. If it is shunned, management will probably have to pay still more to keep valued workers. LENDING Sure, It's Less Red Tape, but ... Banks that make loans to small businesses are no doubt sighing in relief. Thanks to an overhaul of regulations aimed at encouraging banks and savings and loan associations to make more loans in moderate- and low-income areas, they face a lot less paperwork. But the relaxed reporting requirements, adopted last week, are more relaxed than some minority-rights activists believe is healthy. Under the new rules, banks do not have to collect and report information on the race and sex of their small-business borrowers -- as they have to do for home mortgages under the Community Reinvestment Act. The collection of those details was sought by community and consumer groups as a method of uncovering lending bias. But Federal regulators sided with bankers and Republicans in control of Congress and dropped the proposal. The Federal Reserve will, however, let banks, insurance companies and investment houses gather and publish data on business loans by sex and race -- on a voluntary basis. MEDIA The Last Word in Houston What to read in Houston? Why, the Chronicle, of course. The choice between it and the Houston Post was eliminated last week when Hearst, the owner of the 94-year-old Chronicle, bought the 111-year-old Post from Consolidated Newspapers -- and shut it down. At a loss for words, printed or spoken, Post staff members embraced to comfort each other. Now, as the country's fourth-largest city, Houston is the largest city in the country with a single major daily metropolitan newspaper. It has plenty of company across the nation. In Milwaukee, the Sentinel merged with the Journal on April 2, and Providence, R.I., the Evening Bulletin is set to merge with the Journal on June 5. SWINDLES 'I'm Not Entirely to Blame' No doubt, this is the headline Steven Hoffenberg would like to have dictated about his guilty plea last week to criminal conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with a $460 million Ponzi-scheme that he ran through his flagship company, Towers Financial. After the Securities and Exchange Commission had accused him of being a swindler, Mr. Hoffenberg had directed the coverage of his own regulatory troubles in what was then his New York Post. (The Post is now owned by the News Corporation.) In his court appearance last week, Mr. Hoffenberg made accusations against Towers accountants. He did the same thing earlier with one of his lawyers. But no criminal charges against these people have materialized.", "headline": {"main": "Diary"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 1218, "_id": "4fd1ef108eb7c8105d74313f", "snippet": "CURRENCY Big Bird to the Rescue?
