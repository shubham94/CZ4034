That principle underlies Federal policy for handling asbestos in schools. The policy says that school buildings should be inspected thoroughly for the presence of asbestos. Crumbling or damaged asbestos should be removed, since fibers can easily become airborne. But undamaged asbestos should be left in place and checked periodically, since removal could cause some of the material to crumble and fibers to escape.", "snippet": "The health effects of asbestos in buildings has been one of the most contentious environmental issues of the last few years, but experts on all sides of the issue agree on one thing: asbestos is a threat only if its fibers escape into the air, where..."}, {"word_count": 1223, "slideshow_credits": null, "multimedia": [], "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "pub_date": "1993-08-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/02/nyregion/going-smoke-free-more-malls-joining-in-bans-on-tobacco.html", "blog": [], "_id": "4fd1d0878eb7c8105d70a5be", "headline": {"main": "Going Smoke-Free: More Malls Joining In Bans on Tobacco"}, "subsection_name": null, "abstract": null, "section_name": "Front Page; New York and Region", "byline": {"original": "By EVELYN NIEVES", "person": [{"rank": 1, "firstname": "Evelyn", "lastname": "NIEVES", "role": "reported", "organization": ""}]}, "print_page": "1", "document_type": "article", "type_of_material": "News", "keywords": [{"value": "BRIDGEWATER COMMONS", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "SMOKING", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "SHOPPING CENTERS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "RETAIL STORES AND TRADE", "name": "subject"}], "lead_paragraph": "Harry Whitfield can no longer smoke in the office.
