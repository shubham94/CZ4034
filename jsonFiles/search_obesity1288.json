While few people are wholly satisfied with the shape of their bodies, for some, the complaints stem from more than an idealized conception of the human form. These people were born with a tendency to deposit disproportionate amounts of fat in various parts of their bodies, typically around the hips, thighs, buttocks, abdomen, breasts, knees, ankles or chin.", "snippet": "THE laments are all too familiar: ''I can't seem to lose weight in the right places.''

''Moby Dick,'' alone, runs 710 pages. Today, thanks to a small publishing house called Workman, it takes a minute. Through abridging, reabridging and editing out ''rambling soliloquies,'' Workman boasts that it has ''cut down the literary canon to a lean pistol,'' producing an audio-cassette tape that offers listeners ''Ten Classics in Ten Minutes.'' The result is light literature, the latest demonstration that in the 1980's light beer is not the only thing that is less filling. What started out as a way to justify drinking three beers instead of two - the creation of a light beer with a third fewer calories - has become part of a broader phenomenon in which less is valued above more. This is the Light Decade, or as some would have it, Lite. ''Light is a way of thinking that we've come to in the 80's,'' says Dr. Robert T. London, a psychiatrist at New York University Medical Center. ''It's an umbrella phenomenon where lightness transforms itself into the cars we drive, the lightness in a room, our diet, as well as lightness in the relationships we have.''", "snippet": "It used to take so much time -days, sometimes weeks - to read a classic.
