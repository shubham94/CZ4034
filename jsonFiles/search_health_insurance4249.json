Being born too soon, rather than too small, is the main underlying cause of stillbirth and infant deaths within four weeks of birth. Each year in the United States about 31,000 fetuses die before delivery and 22,000 newborns die during the first 27 days of life. The United States has a higher infant mortality rate than those in 19 other countries, and this poor standing has long been attributed mainly to the large number of babies in this country who are born too small, including a large proportion who are born \"small for date,\" or weighing less than they should for the length of time they were in the womb.", "headline": {"main": "Being Born Too Soon Is Worse Than Being Born Too Small"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "11", "word_count": 1034, "_id": "4fd1eca58eb7c8105d73e343", "snippet": "A NEW study of more than 7.5 million births has challenged the assumption that low birth weights per se are the cause of the high infant mortality rate in the United States.
