We circle each other, and I'm a little wary at first, vaguely conscious of keeping the steel rectangular table between us in case he makes a sudden move in my direction. It's a feeling that's not eased by the circumstances of our visit, or by his record. Owing to what the authorities characterize as his ''poor interpersonal management skills,'' evidenced by a series of assaults on prisoners and guards, I have been advised not to get too close to Charlie, probably a poor idea to shake his hand, they said. A corrections officer has been posted just outside the smashproof glass door with orders to keep his eyes glued on our encounter. Not that Charlie appears able to do much damage at the moment. His feet are shackled by leg irons, and he's cuffed to a belly chain, so when I offer my hand finally, by instinct, he can extend his own only a few inches away from his body, in the manner of a flipper. The handshake seems to break the ice, and we smile quickly and sit down on swing-out stools at opposite ends of the table. Charlie starts off by apologizing for the way he looks, the scraggly patches of beard that he missed while shaving that morning. Unlike other prisoners, who shave during their showers, Charlie gets issued a razor only after he is escorted to an observation cell on the mental-health tier, or ''bug ward,'' and then must do the job hurriedly, with one hand chained, while a guard monitors his every movement.", "headline": {"main": "Is Solitary Confinement Driving Charlie Chase Crazy?"}, "abstract": "Bruce Porter profile of Charlie Chase, considered one of most dangerous prison inmates in Massachusetts because of his attacks on other inmates, guards and self; he is being kept in solitary confinement in unit used to punish inmates for serious misconduct while in prison, treatment that appears to spur psychotic behavior; is part of class-action suit by unit inmates charging conditions cumulatively drive inmates insane; Chase comments, interview; photos (L)", "print_page": "52", "word_count": 5214, "_id": "4fd1ef388eb7c8105d7437a6", "snippet": "As I enter the interviewing room, Charlie Chase is standing there alone, dressed in his tan prison scrubs and slip-on sneakers.
