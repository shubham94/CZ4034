The streets are packed with people on the way to work in the gleaming skyscrapers that tower above Puget Sound or shop in the fashionable indoor malls that are the heart of the new downtown. The affluent crowd shuffling past is young, sharply dressed, upwardly mobile: for every briefcase, there's a backpack; for every pin stripe, a pair of blue jeans. Everyone looks fit and prosperous. The whole scene is an advertisement for the good life. I feel like I've stumbled onto the set of a credit-card commercial. Over the last decade Seattle has gained a reputation as the adopted home of America's hip and young, but it was popular even before that; in the last 20 years there have been roughly three waves of immigration. The first began at the height of the 60's and featured Birkenstock-wearing, guru-following, back-to-earth peaceniks lured by the town's frontier charm and boundless natural beauty. Many came without jobs, opting for \"quality of life\" over career track. But as word of Seattle's laid-back pace and affordability got out (and as magazines insisted on labeling it the nation's \"most livable city\"), the migration swelled. During the late 1980's a quarter of a million people moved to this corner of the Northwest.", "headline": {"main": "Seattle, Too Much of a Good Thing?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": 4058, "_id": "4fd1a7208eb7c8105d6c1ebb", "snippet": "A FERRYBOAT WHISTLE SINGS OFF NEARBY ELLIOTT Bay and a warm rain dances off the awning that covers the sidewalk espresso stand -- one of a multitude that line the wide, spotless avenues of downtown Seattle.
