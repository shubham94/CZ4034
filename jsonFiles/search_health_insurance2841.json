Frailty is not normally prized by political activists, but Stahl is an unlikely agitator. A retired medical secretary with nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, she is 85 years old, appears to weigh hardly that many pounds and spent much of her adult life in rural seclusion as the sole female resident on Little Dead Horse Lake, a small community about five miles outside Marcell, Minn. -- a town itself so obscure that it once sold T-shirts asking ''Where the hell is Marcell?'' Only in 1995, when her husband's lung disease kept him from chopping wood to heat their home, did Stahl and her husband move to an apartment in St. Paul. She describes her life until her husband's death, five and a half years ago, as the opposite of radical. ''I always had someone half a step in front of me,'' she said. ''My parents, and then my husband, then the children. I wouldn't have said boo to a turtle, literally.'' The first rumblings of Stahl's political awakening began shortly after moving to the city, when she and her husband signed up for a bus trip to Canada, organized by a local advocacy group called the Minnesota Senior Federation, to buy prescription drugs. They learned that they could much better afford his war chest of medicines by buying them abroad and smuggling them back across the border. Stahl didn't like the fact that in doing so, she was violating federal laws that prohibit anyone other than manufacturers from re-importing drugs, but she couldn't see what was wrong with saving 40 percent on the same prescriptions available at her local pharmacy. She soon began volunteering at the Minnesota Senior Federation because, as she explained, having benefited from the bus ride, it seemed the neighborly thing to do.
