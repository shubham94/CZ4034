In Mr. Mondale's case, the medication consists of a combination of three drugs. The doctor agreed to an extensive interview to discuss the nominee's health, as have the personal doctors of several other national political figures in recent years. Political candidates have become increasingly willing to release their medical records in an effort to shed light on their fitness for office.

The office has drawn attention recently because the publicized financial activities of John A. Zaccaro, husband of Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, focused on his role as a conservator. In addition, last week the top judges of New York State decided to establish formal guidelines for a conservatorship. Although each state has its own statutes concerning conservators, there are general principles regarding the system by which they are appointed. For the conservator concept has developed out of an older process under which a person is declared to be ''incompetent,'' with all of the stigma that that word carries, and an individual or individuals are assigned by a court to act as guardian.", "headline": {"main": "Your Money; Appointing A Conservator"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "30", "word_count": 769, "_id": "4fd154478eb7c8105d6376f1", "snippet": "A CONSERVATOR is appointed by a court to manage the affairs of an adult who has not been declared judicially incompetent, but who is considered unable to manage his or her finances or property.
