And this is all the more true when, as is the case with Harvard University, a great many people, including some of the most powerful people on earth, share that view. Neil Rudenstine, who was Harvard's president from 1991 to 2001, had something like a nervous breakdown a few years into the job. He recovered, and the success of the remainder of his tenure was guaranteed by a combination of courtliness and an almost hyperbolic humility in the face of his own faculty. ''He would thank you for absolutely anything'' is how one university administrator I spoke with put it. By the time Rudenstine announced his intention to retire, the university's governing board, the Harvard Corporation, concluded that the institution had grown complacent, though of course it remained matchless. And so in March 2001, the board replaced Rudenstine with Lawrence H. Summers, a secretary of the treasury during the Clinton administration and a man more inclined to flatten than to flatter a colleague's vanity. ''We didn't think we were hiring Dag Hammerskjold,'' D. Ronald Daniel, a member of the corporation, conceded. Summers, 48, says he has always believed that the best way to show your respect for your fellow man is to argue with him, generally until one or the other of you is forced to admit the error of your ways. And so over the last two years, he has patiently explained to his colleagues in the professional schools and on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences; to students, alumni and donors; and, via the print media, to the nation's elite, with footnotes and caveats and an intellectual bravura that few can deny, or possibly withstand, exactly how and why it is that the time has come for a transformation at Harvard.", "headline": {"main": "Harvard Radical"}, "abstract": "James Traub article profiles Harvard University president Lawrence H Summers; Summers is trying to transform university that perceives itself as matchless; his goals for Harvard are many and include unifying disparate branches and replacing emphasis on ways of knowing with actual knowledge; he is loathed by many faculty members, who see him as overbearing, combative and blunt; in contrast, students who have met and spent time with him tend to like him; part of Summers's agenda is to shift power, traditionally with each separate institution, back toward center; photos (L)", "print_page": "28", "word_count": 7565, "_id": "4fd246718eb7c8105d7e14f2", "snippet": "It is no easy or enviable thing to take over an institution that perceives itself as matchless.
