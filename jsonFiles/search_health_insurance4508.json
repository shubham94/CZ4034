President Reagan tossed his top aides overboard to relieve public distress over the Iran-contra scandal. President Carter fired half his Cabinet when inflation and voters' anger ran amok in 1979. Sacking the staff is Washington's folk remedy for the pain of inflamed public opinion. It only has one drawback: too often, the cure doesn't take. That is the Democrats' fear of the month. Mr. Clinton came home from the beach last week, tanned of face but electorally as pallid as ever, convinced that a fresh slug of discipline and Washington know-how from Leon Panetta -- his new chief of staff, a career Democrat and professional whip cracker -- is enough to steady his Administration. But increasingly, Mr. Clinton's loyal critics in Congress and Democratic research circles are unconvinced. And they are starting to advance the notion that what ails the White House is systemic, not localized, and that only a basic change of direction will revive his political fortunes.", "headline": {"main": "So Many Minds To Be Changed, So Little Time", "kicker": "THE NATION: CRAMMING"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1315, "_id": "4fd1c47d8eb7c8105d6f4632", "snippet": "PRESIDENT CLINTON plans to address the public's dwindling regard for his performance this week in the time-honored manner of every poll-plagued modern President: by shaking his staff up, booting some advisers out and shuffling others around....", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/11/weekinreview/the-nation-cramming-so-many-minds-to-be-changed-so-little-time.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CLINTON, BILL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REFORM AND REORGANIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIDES AND EMPLOYEES"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Michael", "lastname": "WINES"}], "original": "By MICHAEL WINES"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1994-09-11T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Washington; Week in Review"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "lead_paragraph": "It seems like a throwback to old-fashioned politics, two candidates traveling across Connecticut, speaking at luncheons, shaking hands at fairs, marching in parades, telling people face to face why they want to be elected to the United States Senate.
