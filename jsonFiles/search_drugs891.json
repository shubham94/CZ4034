The reasons reveal as much about politics as they do about economics. In a remarkable 1963 paper, Kenneth Arrow of Stanford University laid out what is now the conventional economic theory of insurance. Economists assume people do not like to take risks -- a guarantee that your prescription drug expenses next year will be $1,000 is preferred to a 1-in-10 chance they will be $10,000, even though the average is the same. Fair gambles over small stakes are acceptable, but large ones are to be avoided.
