Dr. Goad, director of the Government-sponsored Genetic Sequence Data Bank, known as GenBank, can read the cryptic language easily. It is an example of the genetic code, this particular procession of characters being the recipe for making a specific protein, the hormone that controls human growth. It will probably take more than three billion characters to encode in this way all the chemicals in the body. One day, Dr. Goad hopes, the complete recipe for a human being will be revealed.

Although she had perfect vision, she had to give up the job two years ago because she could no longer see well enough to drive or to read. Jo had become one of a small group of frustrated people afflicted with a strange neuromuscular disorder that periodically locks their eyelids shut. The condition, called essential blepharospasm, has no known cause or cure, though at least one expert, Dr. Raymond E. Records of the University of Nebraska College of Medicine, believes that the underlying cause may be a tiny stroke in a part of the brain called the brain stem. When victims become so blinded that they can no longer function, surgery that destroys nerves or muscles around the eye can usually restore useful vision, although the operations exchange one handicap for another. Blepharospasm develops over a period of months, usually in people over the age of 60 and only rarely below age 50. Men and women are equally afflicted. Some 1,000 to 1,500 new cases are diagnosed annually but the actual number is undetermined.", "headline": {"main": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "14", "word_count": 1251, "_id": "4fd149448eb7c8105d626494", "snippet": "JO had been a proofreader for 30 years, driving 18 miles each way to her job.
