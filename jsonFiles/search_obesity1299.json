Any level of obesity increases health risks, the panel noted, but it singled out a level of 20 percent or more above ''desirable'' body weight as the point at which doctors should treat an otherwise healthy adult. For those who have other health problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, or a family history of such problems, treatment of overweight should start sooner, the panel said. The 14-member panel, composed of health officials from a variety of disciplines, was convened by the National Institutes of Health to try to arrive at a consensus on current knowledge about the dangers to health of various levels of obesity. Treatment of overweight was not considered, although the panel urged that this question be the focus of a future panel.", "snippet": "Obesity is a killing disease that should receive the same medical attention as high blood pressure, smoking and other factors that cause serious illness and premature death, a Federal panel concluded here today.

''It is the only place in the world you can walk down the street at 300 pounds and no one will look at you strangely,'' said Sheila-John Mack, who came from Illinois three years ago on the Structure House plan; she has since settled in the area. So have scores of other dieters who came to lose weight. Hundreds more return periodically for reinforcement - in both a clinical and social sense; all the dieters interviewed said they have found social acceptance here that they did not enjoy at home. Many say the Durham experience has changed their lives. Miss Mack, for example, not only lost 50 pounds but also switched careers - from architectural designer to buyer and sales clerk in women's clothes - and met the man she will marry. (The meeting was at a softball game that pitted the participants in two diet programs against each other.) It is no wonder, then, that Durham, a city of about 104,000 long known as a tobacco town, has gained a reputation as ''The Diet Capital of the World.'' With its four major weight-loss programs, said to be the only concentration of this kind in the country, it is certainly the diet capital of the nation.", "snippet": "An estimated 2,000 people flock to this city each year to attend one of the many weight-loss programs that have made their home here.
