To pacify Israeli hard-liners, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would seek pardons for Jews who killed Arabs. A3 Iraq Said to Smuggle Oil United States Navy officials said Iraq had been exporting oil, with Iranian help, in violation of United Nations sanctions. They said the Iraqis and their Iranian protectors had had two confrontations with Navy warships in the past two weeks, ramming a United States frigate in one showdown. But the officials said the smugglers often avoid American warships by hugging Iran's shallow, treacherous coast. A7 Ecuador Gets Newest President The President of Ecuador's Congress, Fabian Alarcon, was named President of the country for the second time in under a week. His first promotion came the night that the elected President, Abdala Bucaram, was ousted, but was eventually set aside in favor of the Vice President, Rosalia Arteaga. After the vote, Mrs. Arteaga returned, angrily, to the Vice Presidency and called for a plebiscite on who should run the country. A9 Peru Talks With Rebels A Peruvian Government negotiator met face to face with rebels holding 72 hostages in the Japanese Ambassador's compound in Lima. The talks, the first of their kind in over six weeks, took place in a house across the street from the compound. Representatives of the Red Cross, the Vatican, Japan and Canada took part. A8 Croats Force Out Muslims Croats in the divided Bosnian town of Mostar evicted some 100 Muslims from their homes, hours after firing on 200 Muslims who were visiting a cemetery at the end of the holy month of Ramadan. NATO-led forces and United Nations police began patrolling the streets to prevent more violence. The Mayor of Croat Mostar said the Muslims were disguised soldiers. A11 Charges for Honduran Ex-Chief Prosecutors in Honduras said they would charge a former President, Jose Azcona Hoyo, with illegally extraditing a drug trafficker to the United States. The case grew out of the kidnapping, torture and murder of a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent in Mexico in 1985. The Honduran Constitution says no citizen can be turned over to a foreign country. (AP) China Seals Off Muslim Town China sealed off the northwestern town where at least 10 people were killed in a Muslim separatist riot. An exiled leader said the troubles were set off by the public execution of 30 ethnic Uighurs. (Reuters) NATIONAL A12-22 Clinton and Congress Seek Agreements on 5 Issues President Clinton and Congressional leaders agreed to try to agree on five issues: a tax credit for employers who hire people off welfare; education; tax cuts for individuals; juvenile crime and juvenile justice, and using the District of Columbia as a laboratory to test new ideas for education, employment and economic growth. They did not agree on changing campaign finance laws, health insurance for children or toxic waste disposal. A1 Campaign finance reformers faced other difficulties on Capitol Hill. Democratic and Republican leaders clashed on the terms of an investigation into the alleged abuses that occurred during the 1996 campaign. And supporters of a bill to revise the laws worried that it seemed to be losing momentum. A1 Hearings for Nominee Delayed The chairman of a Senate committee postponed hearings on the nomination of Anthony Lake to lead the Central Intelligence Agency until March 11. He said there were many ''unanswered, perplexing questions'' about Mr. Lake's conduct as national security adviser during President Clinton's first term. A19 A Losing Cosmological Bet Dr. Stephen W. Hawking, the cosmologist, conceded defeat in a famous bet he made six years ago with two professors at the California Institute of Technology. He bet that naked singularities -- places other than the centers of black holes where space and time are infinitely distorted and matter is infinitely dense -- could not exist. A scholar in Texas showed that, in theory, they could. A1 Hubble Repairmen Blast Off Seven astronauts aboard the shuttle Discovery blasted into space, heading for the Hubble Space Telescope. They are scheduled to replace two aging scientific instruments with more up-to-date ones and give the telescope a tuneup. A12 Trial Opens in Racial Killing North Carolina prosecutors began presenting their case against a white former Army private. They said he teamed up with a compatriot to kill a couple in Fayetteville in December 1995 because the couple was black. A12 Pooch Wins a Reprieve Portsmouth, N.H., pardoned Prince, a black Labrador mix who had been on death row since August for killing a rooster. But the agreement requires that a home be found for him outside Portsmouth. A15 Knife Brings a Suspension A high school honor student in Gobles, Mich., was suspended for 10 days for bringing a knife to school. She said it was a kitchen knife that she planned to use to cut a friend's birthday brownies. School board members said the action showed they were serious about weapons in schools, even though the student, Amber Nash, did not plan to use the knife as a weapon. (AP) NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 City Women's Shelter Replaces Its Entire Staff The entire staff of the only shelter for battered women run directly by New York City was replaced. Investigators said the shelter's workers had forced women to have sex, used drugs and alcohol on the job and allowed abusive husbands and boyfriends into the shelter at night. A1 Dinkins Decides Against Race Former Mayor David N. Dinkins told associates he would not run for Mayor this year. Some of the associates said he would probably endorse the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, instead. B1 Battle to Control Adelphi U. The trustees of Adelphi University won a court order blocking their removal by the State Board of Regents. The board, which put new trustees in power on Monday, said it would appeal. Each side said its trustees were in charge in the meantime. B1 Workfare Chief to Go Private Richard J. Schwartz, the architect of New York City's workfare program, announced he was leaving City Hall. He will form a consulting company to work with state and local governments on overhauling welfare systems. His career change illustrated the profit-making opportunities that have arisen from the new Federal welfare law. B3 HEALTH C8 Starchy Diet May Be Harmful People who eat lots of potatoes, white bread and white rice in the mistaken belief that it is the best way to follow a low-fat diet may do themselves more harm than good: the diet may increase their risk of diabetes, a study found. The researchers recommended eating more fiber. C8 SPORTS B14-19 LIVING C1-7 ARTS C9-18 Independents in the Oscars Independent films like ''The English Patient,'' ''Shine'' and ''Fargo'' dominated the Oscar nominations. Some of Hollywood's biggest studios, like Warner Brothers and Universal, were virtually shut out of top nominations, as was Madonna.
