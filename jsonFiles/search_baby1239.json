The Vatican show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was sponsored in large part by Philip Morris. And in Minneapolis, there is a new production of ''Peer Gynt'' at the Guthrie Theater - thanks to a grant from the Dayton-Hudson Corporation, a leading retailer headquartered there. But this year, The Exxon Corporation, the largest corporate philanthropist, has shifted more than $3 million from arts and public television to health and social welfare. Mobil Oil, another big spender, is shifting some of its arts spending to Young Audiences, a program that brings the performing arts to schoolchildren in Washington, D.C., and to the National Organization for Arts for the Handicapped. ''We've been seeking out these kinds of programs, rather than museum exhibitions for people who could otherwise afford them,'' said Herbert Schmertz, Mobil's vice president, public affairs. And as for Philip Morris, ''Whether, over time, we'll continue as strongly with the arts is a big question,'' said Barbara Reuter, the company's former contributions manager. ''With the Reagan Administration asking companies to do more in the social services, it will be harder to justify cultural programs.''", "headline": {"main": "BIG BUSINESS TIGHTENS ITS ARTS BUDGET"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 3071, "_id": "4fd12c188eb7c8105d5f610d", "snippet": "This season, the complete ''Ring'' cycle is being shown on public television's ''Great Performances,'' courtesy of the Exxon Corporation.
