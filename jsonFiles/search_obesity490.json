Perhaps 300 people -- mostly young, white, and hip -- live in each building, from one to eight people to each loft. Few were born before the mid-1980s. Rents can range from $375 for one person to roughly $800 for a space. \"To spend a few days at the McKibbin lofts is to experience what it is to be young, hungry for acceptance, and willing to put up with just about anything in order to gain a foothold in the city's competitive, and thriving, underground art and music scenes,\" Ms. Buckley writes. \"This could have been Greenwich Village 60 years ago, or SoHo 30 years ago, or the East Village in the 1990s.\"", "snippet": "Also in Morning Buzz: the scuttling (for now) of St. Vincent's expansion plan; doctors on the state medical board's watch
