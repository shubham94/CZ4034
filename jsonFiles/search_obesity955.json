In the spring of 2000, another one will open on the strip, and a sixth is 10 miles down the road in East Norwich. These are not places where you will learn the names of obscure French mushrooms and the presentation will be so artful you won't want to mess it up. These are steakhouses, where the menu needs no translation and the food laps over the plate. In spite of more than two decades of warnings about the dangers of red meat, there are more steakhouses feeding more steaks to more Long Islanders than ever before.", "snippet": "NIGHT after night, the parking lots are jammed with expensive cars as patrons crowd into four restaurants along the two-mile strip of Northern Boulevard between Great Neck and Roslyn.

Twenty years ago, children consumed twice as much milk as soda. Today the reverse is true. This national appetite for empty calories is crowding out important nutrients found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and dairy products. It also contributes to rising obesity rates. Last month a coalition of concerned nutrition experts and organizations, including the American Public Health Association, urged the Food and Drug Administration to supply consumers who want to cut back on sugar with important information that is not now readily available to them. At the moment, labels list only total sugars in a given product. They do not say which sugar occurs naturally and which is derived from an added ingredient like white or brown sugar, corn syrup or honey. The group's petition asks the agency to set a recommended daily intake for refined sugar, and then require that all food labels disclose how much is in each serving, and what percentage of the maximum daily intake that represents.", "snippet": "Since 1983, consumption of sugars and other caloric sweeteners by Americans has risen nearly 30 percent.
