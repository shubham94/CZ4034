Chuck Errig, Baltimore Because your rep was performing her duties when she got robbed, the company should reimburse her for what was, in a sense, a travel expense. Companies routinely pay for employee foul-ups -- making dozens of ectoplasmic photocopies before getting a legible one; making lackluster feature films with J. Lo and Ben. Your rep's behavior, while more risible, is akin to such ordinary business blunders. (This would not be the case if she'd been robbed later that evening on her way home from the theater.) However, if she is a persistently unwary traveler, you might assign her some other sort of work, or a wily guide. As a practical matter, how will she put in for reimbursement?

Neighborhood residents refused to take it lying down. By the fall, some three months after the closings -- and long after demonstrations at the five other closed houses (in Harlem, Brooklyn and Queens) had faded -- the protest at Engine Company 212 was still going strong. Firefighters and local residents draped the facade of the two-story, redbrick building on a scrubby section of Wythe Avenue with banners reading ''fire cuts kill'' and ''budgets slashed, brooklyn burned.'' In a tent on the sidewalk in front of the firehouse, volunteers from the neighborhood took turns sleeping each night. By day, they collected signatures on a petition, determined to get their firehouse reopened. Their goal was not as quixotic as it might seem. In New York City politics there are few issues more volatile than firehouse closings -- especially after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, when the Fire Department lost 343 men and New York City firefighters became known around the world as America's Heroes. But even before that tragedy, politicians knew that closing a firehouse was not to be done lightly.
