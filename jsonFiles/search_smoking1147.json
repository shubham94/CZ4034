Communities from New York to Oregon have reported human health problems that they fear are linked to exposure to dioxin, although the links have not been proved scientifically. Officials in Missouri say the number of sites there believed contaminated by the chemical has risen to about 100, and Gov. Christopher S. Bond has asked his Legislature to set up a special fund to help clean them up. Dioxin, he said, could lead to ''public hysteria'' if not handled properly. Accord on Animal Research Research biologists and environmental scientists generally agree that in laboratory experiments on animals, dioxin has more harmful effects, and in smaller doses, than any chemical man has produced. Twenty-five millionths of a gram is known to be potent enough to kill a two-pound animal. There are 28 grams in an ounce.", "snippet": "The deadly chemical dioxin, an unwanted byproduct of herbicides, pesticides and other industrial products, is raising increasing concern among government agencies, scientific researchers and people who may come in contact with it.
