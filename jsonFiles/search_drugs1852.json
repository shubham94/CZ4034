Now the editor of the nation's leading medical journal is concerned about a ''medical-industrial complex.'' Its components aren't the old-line companies that produce drugs, supplies and equipment but, rather, new suppliers of health care and medical services. These include proprietary hospitals and nursing homes, diagnostic laboratories, home care services, kidney dialysis centers and other businesses with a combined annual gross income estimated at $40 billion. Some are owned by large corporations but many are owned in whole or in part by physicians. And that is what most disturbs Dr. Arnold S. Relman, writing in The New England Journal of Medicine. He says the growth of this private industry is ''the most important recent development in American health care.'' The new entrepreneurs are welcome in some respects. Governments and nonprofit voluntary institutions have been unable to meet the soaring demand for quality care at affordable costs. Perhaps private enterprise can do a better and cheaper job, at least in some services, and raise more capital for needed facilities. But Dr. Relman asks troubling questions about the long-term implications.", "headline": {"main": "Medicine as Enterprise"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": 449, "_id": "4fd10a3d8eb7c8105d5bd190", "snippet": "President Eisenhower once warned of a ''military-industrial complex.''
