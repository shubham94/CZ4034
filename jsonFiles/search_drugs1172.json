Chief of staff to Richard Nixon, Haldeman served from the President's election until April 30, 1973, when he, along with his college friend John Ehrlichman and other top Nixon appointees, resigned amid mounting accusations of efforts to cover up the political scandal that began with the break-in of the Democratic national headquarters at the Watergate complex. H. R. Haldeman, a successful Los Angeles advertising executive, worked for the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket in 1956. Looking, he said, for an adventure beyond advertising, he was drawn to Nixon by opportunity as well as ideology -- both he and Nixon were active in California business circles. But he also admired Nixon's \"fighting\" spirit. Haldeman served as Nixon's chief advance man in his race against John F. Kennedy in 1960, as manager of Nixon's 1962 gubernatorial bid and as manager again of Nixon's triumphant 1968 Presidential campaign.", "headline": {"main": "Growing Up A Haldeman"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "30", "word_count": 9076, "_id": "4fd1d7738eb7c8105d715c09", "snippet": "The turbulent Washington waters have claimed many public figures over the years, but few as powerful as Harry Robbins (Bob) Haldeman.
