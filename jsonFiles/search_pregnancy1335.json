Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 120 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). Am\u00e9lie (Ms. Tautou) is a waitress in Paris and tinkers with the lives of her friends. When she falls in love with Nino (Mr. Kassovitz), she can't be direct and let him know how she feels. Instead, she pulls him into an elaborate courtship dance that turns life in Paris into a game of Twister with a treasure hunt added to the mix. Nino trails after Am\u00e9lie, still the mystery woman to him, as she leaves clues about herself everywhere. By the climax, the movie segues into a rumination on loss and the perils of being too playful. The film's original French title was ''Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain,'' and Mr. Jeunet deflates the self-mocking pomposity of the title by the last third of the movie. Yet there is no denying that ''Am\u00e9lie'' is, to paraphrase its title, fabulous (Elvis Mitchell).", "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": 3225, "_id": "4fd26be38eb7c8105d82477b", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series.
