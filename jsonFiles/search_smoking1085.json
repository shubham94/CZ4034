They are expressing concern that 6.8 percent of all babies - 12.4 percent of black babies - are low weight, that is, under 5 1/2 pounds, at birth. Research has demonstrated conclusively that the risk of death increases as birth weight decreases. Doctors are asking other questions too: Why, when science is continually finding new ways to prolong life for the elderly, do nearly 40,000 American babies die each year in the first 12 months of life? And why is the infant mortality rate for blacks still, as in 1965, almost twice the infant mortality rate for whites? For the interrelated problems of infant mortality and low birth weight, many of the solutions are already known to medical experts.", "snippet": "Federal officials and public health experts are asking why, in an age of medical miracles, the decline in the nation's infant mortality rate has slowed perceptibly.

A combination of ignorance and male conceit led most to think of infertility as a woman's problem. Faced with the ego-threatening possibility that they might be unable to father children, many men even refused to submit to examinations. In the last decade or two, much has been learned about the contribution of male infertility to the fact that one couple in seven is involuntarily childless. It is now known that a problem with the man is the primary cause of infertility in about 30 percent of these couples and is a contributing cause in 20 percent more. In other words, just as men are 50-50 partners in parenthood, they are also 50-50 partners in the failure to achieve parenthood. New causes of male infertility are being discovered almost every year as more couples seek explanations for their difficulty in becoming parents. There is now even a subspecialty in urology called andrology, the study of male fertility.", "snippet": "THOUGH people have known probably since they evolved that it takes two - a man and a woman - to produce a baby, until the 1960's little if any attention was paid to the man when a couple failed to conceive.
