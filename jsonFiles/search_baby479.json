My general mood today is: -- Ecstatic. -- Generally happy. -- Fine. -- I want to kill the person next to me on the F train flossing. Most days I feel: -- Dandy. -- Strangers on the train. -- Like ''I've got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby.'' -- Like I could beat a baby seal to death and laugh the whole time. When I have time to myself and my mind wanders, the thoughts are: -- Positive. -- Negative. -- Sex. -- Bela Karolyi. If I was informed that my recent girl/boyfriend was seen on a date just eight days after the breakup, I would: -- Wish them the best. -- Wonder with whom. -- Follow her/him and consider going to that store in the East 30's that sells C.I.A.-like equipment where you can listen to people up to a mile away without their knowledge. -- Hope he/she got food poisoning. The effect of living in a crowded, noisy, expensive city and working in a dead-end job in a windowless office where the ''big'' thrill is signing yet another co-worker's birthday card with some dopey line you don't even mean and then, later, Thursday night drinks and random hook-ups that leave you embarrassed and will eventually make you wonder if New York is really for you to the point where you feel: -- Excited to meet the day. -- Satisfied that life is offering you more than you ever imagined in college. -- What was the question? -- A cold coming on. Let's say I just saw your old girl/boyfriend and she/he looked really happy and couldn't recall your name. That would make you feel: -- Confused. -- Hurt. -- Gassy. -- Like punching the questioner in the face, hard, like a bunch of times. I watch reruns of ''Law & Order'' even though I have seen them many times before, and there are books I have not read, and that art history class at the New School, and even just a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge at dusk -- but then, there's the Burritoville menu right there by the phone and so I: -- Think about showering this week. -- Feel lonely. -- Look at Craigslist's ''casual encounters'' section and then feel dirty. -- Think I'll have a ''California Chicken Bab-o-rito'' with a side of plantains. Seriously, though, if you learned that someone just saw your old girl/boyfriend, like, 20 minutes ago with this super-hot girl/guy, and they looked really happy, how would you feel? -- Like tackling you and stuffing a sleeve of thin mints down your throat. -- I want to go home now. -- I hate forms and I hate this office and wish I was dead. -- Depressed.", "headline": {"main": "Take This Quiz and Call Me in the Morning", "kicker": "Op-Ed Contributor"}, "abstract": "Author John Kenney humorous Op-Ed questionnaire to determine if a patient is at risk for depression; drawing (M)", "print_page": "13", "word_count": 503, "_id": "4fd25dfd8eb7c8105d80ce1d", "snippet": "A simple questionnaire to determine your risk for depression.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/16/opinion/16kenney.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COMEDY AND HUMOR"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MENTAL HEALTH AND DISORDERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEPRESSION (MENTAL)"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "John", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Kenney"}], "original": "By John Kenney"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-04-16T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Opinion"}], "meta": {"hits": 1, "offset": 0, "time": 32}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
