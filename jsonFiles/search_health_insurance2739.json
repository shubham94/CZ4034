Mr. Cook, left, who took over day-to-day operations during chief executive Steven P. Jobs' recovery from cancer surgery last year, will essentially become the No.2 person at Apple. ''Tim has been doing this job for over two years now, and it's high time we officially recognized it with this promotion,'' Mr. Jobs said in a statement. Mr. Cook, 44, will continue to overseeing worldwide operations and leading the Macintosh division, and will work with Mr. Jobs and the executive team to lead Apple's overall business, Apple said. The company also said Jon Rubinstein, head of the iPod unit, will retire March 31 and be succeeded by Tony Fadell, vice president for iPod engineering. (AP) Pension Agency Objects to Airline's Reorganization Plan The government agency that insures corporate pensions has objected to United Airlines' reorganization plan, saying in court documents that the carrier has changed a deal covering the termination of its pensions. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation said in a filing that the airline's disclosure statement, which details its financial model, is ''unconfirmable.'' United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, must get bankruptcy court approval of the statement before asking creditors to vote on restructuring. The agency complained that the plan was inconsistent with a settlement the parties reached last spring for the airline to turn its pensions over to the government. (Reuters) Medical Device Maker Posts a Quarterly Loss Boston Scientific said yesterday that it had lost ground to its only medical device rival in the lucrative market for drug-coated heart stents, reporting a $269 million third-quarter loss and slowing sales of a stent that provided big profits last year. The performance, hurt by a $598 million expense for a legal settlement, fell short of company's projection and Wall Street's expectations. Boston Scientific executives said in a conference call with analysts that its Taxus stent has lost market share to the Cypher stent made by Johnson & Johnson's Cordis Corporation. The company, based in Natick, Mass., said it lost 33 cents a share and the results compared with a profit of $258 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 2 percent, to $1.51 billion. (AP) Bank of America's Purchase of MBNA Advances Delaware's banking commissioner yesterday approved the proposed $35 billion acquisition of MBNA by the Bank of America Corporation, moving the buyout of the world's largest independent credit card issuer one step closer to completion. The approval of the Delaware banking commissioner, Robert Glen, was required because MBNA is based in Wilmington, Del. Bank of America is based in Charlotte, N.C. (AP) Justice Department Approves Software Merger Adobe Systems said late Thursday that the Justice Department had approved its $3.4 billion acquisition of Macromedia. Adobe and Macromedia, two of the largest providers of graphic design software, must wait for several European jurisdictions to approve the deal before it can close. Adobe's Illustrator and Macromedia's Freehand are two of the leading products for vector graphics illustration, a term for drawings that are stored as collections of points and objects instead of pixels. A combined company would also own a substantial part of the market for Web site-building tools. (AP) Profit Rises 21 Percent at Insurer UnitedHealth The UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest health insurance companies, reported a 21 percent increase in third-quarter profit on membership gains and lower-than-expected medical costs. The company forecast profit growth would continue through 2006 at an annual rate of at least 15 percent. UnitedHealth predicted a Medicare prescription drug benefit would add 2 million to 3 million members to its rolls next year, potentially increasing 2006 earnings by 5 cents a share. UnitedHealth said it expected to complete its acquisition of PacifiCare Health by year-end or early in 2006. UnitedHealth said its third-quarter profit rose to $842 million, or 64 cents a share, from $698 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15 percent, to $11.3 billion. (Reuters) Bush Seeks End to Lumber Trade Dispute With Canada President Bush told the Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin yesterday that it was time to find a solution to a long-running trade fight between the two countries over softwood lumber. A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said Mr. Bush and Mr. Martin spoke by telephone for about 20 minutes, and trade was a major part of their discussion. Mr. Martin criticized the United States government last week for its position on trade in lumber, saying Washington was ignoring a North American Free Trade Agreement ruling against United States duties on Canadian softwood lumber. (Reuters) Developer's Bid for British Grocer Is Accepted A billionaire property developer, Robert Tchenguiz, and two partners won the right to buy Somerfield, a British grocer, for \u00a31.08 billion ($1.9 billion) to gain control of its real estate. The bid, 197 pence for each share in Somerfield, was accepted, Anthony Cardew, a spokesman for Somerfield, said yesterday. The investor group includes Tchenguiz, Apax Partners Worldwide and Barclays Capital. Mr. Tchenguiz will get control of 1,300 Somerfield and Kwik Save stores. Somerfield is based in Bristol, England.
