The plan will take effect this fall for most of the 5,700 adults with children who live in city shelters. $(Page 1.$) Clinton's Manhattan Bash President Clinton plans to celebrate turning 50 by concentrating on one of his driving priorities -- raising campaign funds, this time through an elaborate birthday bash at Radio City Music Hall. Some of the biggest money will be raised after the Radio City show at a dinner at the Waldorf, where the ticket minimum is $10,000 per person. $(1.$) A Manhattan baker had the task of making the birthday cake for the Presidential bash. But first he had to get permission to miss class. $(9.$) Requiem for a Music Store After a lifetime of selling scores to instrumentalists, vocalists and a conductor or two -- from private-school band directors in her Upper East Side neighborhood to stick wavers from across town at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall -- Ruth Binzer is closing the sheet-music store her father bought, her mother ran and she and her sister inherited. $(21.$) Out of Sadness, Garden Grows For more than two years after Kali Ann Poulton disappeared in a Rochester suburb, people hoped, or prayed, that she was still alive.

And so people began arriving at Gleason Estates, at the raised flower bed dedicated to Kali on the first anniversary of her abduction. $(21.$) 'Someone Who Wants to Help' Three years ago in Crown Heights, Rabbi Israel Shemtov rescued a woman who had been shot. On Monday, he talked a man out of jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge. But he has also been charged over the years with assault, rioting and just plain getting in the way. ''Why should I put my neck out?'' Rabbi Shemtov asked. ''Sometimes with a yell you can let someone feel there is someone who wants to help.'' About New York by David Gonzalez. $(21.$) Criticism Over Drugs at Dance The Morning Party, an annual gay dance that draws thousands to Fire Island Pines, raises hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Gay Men's Health Crisis. But it is widely known that drugs have become an integral part of the dance, with critics contending that Gay Men's Health Crisis is turning a blind eye to the drug use that impairs judgment and reduces inhibitions, leading to the sexual behavior that can result in transmission of the AIDS virus. $(22.$) More Surgery for Officer A police officer who was ambushed and shot in the head in Washington Heights underwent a second round of surgery. Hospital officials said his condition was deteriorating and then stabilizing from one hour to the next. The Police Department continued to search for a suspect. $(23.$) Police Report Cited in Suit In an unusual civil rights lawsuit being heard in Federal District Court in Manhattan, three current and former officers in the corruption-ridden 30th Precinct are accused of hitting and wrongly arresting a mother and her son in Harlem in 1991. To bolster the case, lawyers for the mother and son have enlisted the aid of the Mollen Commission report. $(23.$) Official May Veto Language Bill In a signal that he may veto a bill to make English the official language of Suffolk County, County Executive Robert J. Gaffney issued a statement saying that he would oppose the measure if he concluded that it singled out Hispanic people. $(24.$) REGION Witnesses Crucial to Inquiry Witnesses like Michael Russell, who saw the crash of T.W.A. Flight 800, have helped shape both the technical inquiry into the cause of the crash and the F.B.I.'s hunt for clues to any possible criminal acts. $(21.$) Preliminary examination of all four engines from Flight 800 largely rule out the idea that engine failure caused the crash. $(24.$) Queens Hit by Another Jet Piece An eight-foot section of a wing flap broke off a T.W.A. plane and plunged onto a Queens street, where it left deep gashes in the roadway.
