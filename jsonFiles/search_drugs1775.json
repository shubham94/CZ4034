The notion of fever as beneficial persisted for more than 2,000 years, and countless patients were actually treated with ''fever therapy'' to aid their recovery from such ailments as syphilis, tuberculosis and even mania. Then, in the mid-1800's, aspirin compounds that rapidly reduced fevers became commercially available and the medical view of fever changed abruptly. For the next hundred years, physicians and patients focused on bringing down fevers, sometimes with such drastic measures as cold baths and alcohol rubs. Now, the view of fever is undergoing yet another about-face, thanks to recent research that has in essence documented the benefits suspected by the Greeks. Fever, the studies indicate, evolved at least 300 million years ago in cold-blooded vertebrates as a means of helping the body fight off invading organisms.", "headline": {"main": "FEVER: NEW VIEW STRESSES ITS HEALING BENEFITS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1545, "_id": "4fd141878eb7c8105d619c36", "snippet": "THE ancient Greeks, who regarded disease as an imbalance of ''humors,'' believed fever cured the sick by cooking the bad humors and helping the body get rid of them.

O'Neill Jr., Democrat of Massachusetts, say they expect a public works jobs bill to be at the top of the agenda of the new Congress. Both say further that they expect the President, who has assailed such programs as counterproductive \"makework\" legislation, to reverse himself and support the measure in an effort to reduce unemployment, now at 10.8 percent.

Baker Jr., the Senate majority leader, said, \"I would anticipate that the President will support some form of jobs program.\" Both the House and the Senate approved separate public works jobs bills in the post-election session of Congress, but they were withdrawn under threat of a Presidential veto.
