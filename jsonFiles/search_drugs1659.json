Although the percentage of nicotine addicts has declined dramatically since the Surgeon General's first ''Report on Smoking and Health'' 20 years ago, 55 million Americans - nearly a third of the adults and 20 percent of the teen- agers - continue to use tobacco. According to surveys, a majority of the adults who do so say they would like to quit, and most have tried to at least once. The pleasurable effects of nicotine - and the unpleasant effects of its absence - are a major reason why so many people have difficulty giving up tobacco. For those dependent on nicotine who have tried to shake the habit and failed there may be some hope. It comes in the form of a nicotine gum recently approved as a prescription drug by the Food and Drug Administration. Sold under the trade name Nicorette, the gum is the first antismoking substance to have gone through the extensive clinical and safety tests required for such F.D.A. approval. Dr. John W. Farquhar, director of Stanford University's heart-disease prevention program, likens Nicorette to methadone, which used to limit the pangs of withdrawal from heroin. In an interview in Patient Care magazine, he said that ''both substitutes prevent withdrawal symptoms without producing the 'pleasures' of the addicting drugs.''", "headline": {"main": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": 1264, "_id": "4fd138fb8eb7c8105d60c9e2", "snippet": "NICOTINE is the most widely used addicting drug among Americans except for caffeine.
