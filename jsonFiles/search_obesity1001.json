A1 Hillary Rodham Clinton received a warm welcome while visiting Neve Shalom, Israel, an Arab-Israeli village, to plead the case for a land-for-security plan. That plan is now seen as much more her husband's priority than that of the Israeli Prime Minister. A11 Russia's Institutional Poverty State institutions in Russia have fallen prey to the country's shrinking budgets and rising inflation, squeezing out money to pay for food, clothes and medicine at prisons, hospitals and orphanages. At one women's prison, the official daily food allowance is 65 kopeks, which is about three cents. A3 New Effort for Nazi Victims Germany's banks and industrial conglomerates are urgently trying to devise a broad plan to compensate Holocaust survivors and Poles, Russians and other Europeans enslaved by the Nazis.

A10 Another Slaying in Iran A third dissident writer who disappeared in Iran in the last month has been found dead, and hopes that the country might be moving toward a more tolerant new day are giving way to fears of darker times ahead. Although the attacks have outraged many people in Iran and prompted calls for swift Government action, the main effect has been to expose President Mohammad Khatami's relative impotence. A6 U.S. Issues Terrorist Alert United States Embassies in four Persian Gulf countries warned of a ''strong possibility'' that terrorists might attempt an attack against one or more American targets in the region in the coming month. The warning was unusually precise and was accompanied by a show of particular concern. A7 Church Group's Growing Pains The World Council of Churches, an organization dedicated to promoting Christian unity, has found itself in the unusual position of balking at accepting a new member.

A10 NATIONAL A18-28 President Clinton Deflects Calls for His Resignation President Clinton rebuffed Republican calls for him to admit to lying under oath and said flatly that he had not committed perjury. Mr. Clinton deflected suggestions that he should step down, saying he has no intention of resigning. A1 Republican governors, state party leaders and strategists around the country said the party's march toward impeachment would cause no lasting political damage. A1 The pressure intensifies daily on Jim Leach of Iowa, one of 20 or 30 Congressmen, most of them Republicans, who have remained publicly uncommitted on whether Mr. Clinton should be impeached. A25 There may or may not be enough rebellious Republicans to stop impeachment on the House floor this week. But the real question is whether there are enough of them willing to break with the rules set by their leaders for the handling of the impeachment vote. A27 In opposing a censure of President Clinton, many Republicans argued that the Constitution contains no words allowing Congress to take that step. Perhaps not, but that has not stopped lawmakers of yesteryear.

Mr. Kerrey, a 55-year-old Democrat who was briefly a candidate in the 1992 Presidential contest, said Vice President Al Gore's strong lead in the race for the nomination influenced his decision not to make a second bid. A20 Victims of Domestic Violence The killings of a Seattle woman and her child have struck a nerve among advocates for the victims of domestic violence, because the woman had carefully followed procedures to insure their safety, and yet the system failed them. A18 Serious Crime Lower Again Serious crimes dropped another 5 percent in the first half of this year, extending a six-year trend, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported today. A23 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Adult Form of Diabetes Rising Sharply in Children The number of children with Type 2 diabetes, an incurable disease that can cause kidney failure, blindness and poor circulation and that occurred mostly during middle age or later, has risen sharply, as childhood obesity has become an epidemic in America. A1 Drawing a Line on Spending Lavish holiday parties once thrown by the expelled president of one of the city's largest municipal union locals have come under scrutiny, as investigators try to identify the line at which spending by union officials crosses the line from profligacy into illegality.
