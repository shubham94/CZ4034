And the Pontiff concluded his encounter with the often fractious American branch of the church by invoking Abraham Lincoln in a ringing call for the faithful to carry their religious values into the political arena. [ Page A1. ] NEW YORK CITY EDUCATOR ACCEPTS CHANCELLORSHIP Rudolph Franklin Crew agreed to accept the chancellorship of New York City's public schools, challenging New Yorkers to join him in a crusade to improve education that he likened to the civil rights struggle and promising to fundamentally change the system's central bureaucracy. \"My first role is going to be to listen to people, to reach out to people, to synthesize a movement,\" he said. \"And it is a movement. Some people will call it reform. Some will call it restructuring. This is not a faint-hearted exercise.\" A day after the city's Board of Education voted, 5 to 2, to offer him the job after a highly contentious search, Dr. Crew, the Superintendent of Schools in Tacoma, Wash., said he would review the job description of every administrator at the board's downtown Brooklyn headquarters and reassign anyone not directly involved in teaching and learning. [ A1. ] 'MIRACLE MAN,' WITH SOME DISSENTERS Less than two years into Dr. Crew's tenure as Superintendent in Tacoma, a piece of astonishing news circulated through the schools that hug the hills of that blue-collar mill town. In one year, the standardized test scores for students in the two major grade levels went up by an average of 19 percent. The turnaround was attributed to Dr. Crew, a man described by some as a sort of miracle worker. But even while he was being praised in national education journals and by a majority of the school board and the political leaders in Tacoma, some dissenting voices were emerging in the school trenches -- among teachers and parents. [ A1. ] FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION IN TACOMA Dr. Crew's acceptance of the schools chancellor's post was met with relief and joy from many parents, as well as union leaders and elected officials in New York. But in Tacoma, his decision provoked feelings of frustration and betrayal. The Tacoma Public School Board met in a hastily scheduled meeting to discuss what one member called \"potential litigation\" involving Dr. Crew's contract, which the board had recently extended for three years, with an increase in salary. [ B3. ] THE EDUCATION OF MAYOR GIULIANI The latest contretemps over the school system has proved to be less about the education of students than the education of Mayor Giuliani. Try as he might, Mr. Giuliani learned that even he could not gain control of the city schools -- and their budget -- by mayoral fiat. His force of will, and a display of power that might have made even Fiorello La Guardia wince, weren't enough. They couldn't overcome the obstacles that stood in Mr. Giuliani's way, and still do: the law that curtails the Mayor's power over the schools and the knotted politics behind the law. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [ B3. ] REGION UPROAR OVER H.I.V. SCREENING The New Jersey Insurance Department has provoked an uproar among medical experts and state civil libertarians by quietly proposing rules that would allow health insurers to screen new applicants for the AIDS virus and to reject those whose tests are positive or who refuse to be tested. As the administrative proposal came to light, the State Medical Society and civil rights advocates protested that the policy could allow insurers to circumvent existing Federal and state laws that forbid insurers to deny coverage to applicants who have H.I.V., the AIDS virus. [ B4. ] POLICE SEARCH FOR LINK IN 5 MURDERS The police in Bridgeport, Conn., said that they are examining five unsolved murders of women involved in prostitution or drugs to see if the murders were committed by an Easton man arrested on Saturday and charged with stabbing and raping a woman in an abandoned building in Bridgeport. Detective Sgt. Joseph Sherbo said the man, 31-year-old Darrell Monks, had not been questioned since his arrest at 12:30 A.M. on Saturday in Easton, where he lives with his parents.
