Mrs. Clinton acknowledged this month that 1,400 names from an official invitation list for a White House holiday party had been sent to her campaign and put on fund-raising lists. She said that the use of the list was an accident and that no wrongdoing had occurred. Her Senate campaign on Friday called the complaint a political stunt. Clifford J. Levy (NYT) ALBANY: MINORITY POLICE RECRUITMENT The New York State Police Academy is having difficulty recruiting women and members of minority groups. In the class of 84 troopers that graduated last week, four were women, three were black and one was Hispanic. The seven-month gap between taking the police examination and entering the academy is a major factor, said Col. Harry J. Corbitt, deputy superintendent at the academy. ''A lot can happen in seven months when you're in your mid-20's,'' the age of many applicants, he said. For example, in the most recent class, of the 149 women the academy admitted, six entered and four graduated.
