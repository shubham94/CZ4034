We agree: scientists are generally skeptics. As cautious pragmatists, our work has improved life expectancy and quality. Epidemiology demonstrated the hazards of smoking, the benefits of lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, that infant sleeping position reduces SIDS, sun exposure causes melanoma and folate supplementation helps prevent birth defects. Some were \u201cbolts from the blue,\u201d and since no one knows what bolts remain undetected, we keep looking. Uncertainty along the way is the hallmark of science and the price of progress. Premature media pronouncements erode public trust. Good epidemiologists eschew these. Clinical trials, also in our toolbox, are useful but no panacea because we cannot randomly expose people to risks and because participants are self-selected and often unrepresentative. Granted, epidemiology is time consuming, expensive and requires public will. But don\u2019t lose the forest for the trees: epidemiology has hugely improved health.", "headline": {"main": "Letters", "print_headline": "Do We Really Know What Makes Us Healthy?"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "20", "word_count": "1718", "_id": "5485860579881040e1d4c199", "snippet": "Gary Taubes (Sept. 16) urges caution in accepting premature epidemiologic results.
