Somewhere between the ages of 2 and 3, most children learn to control elimination most of the time. While occasional accidents are common and accepted in early childhood, beyond the preschool years incontinence is nearly always cause for humiliation and distress. Eight to 10 million Americans, most of them adults, face this distress daily. They suffer from what medical experts call bladder incontinence, the inability to prevent the release of urine at inappropriate times. Rather than risk public disgrace, many people, children and young adults among them, become social recluses. For the elderly, incontinence is often the symptom that exhausts their family's ability to cope; the aged relative may be placed in a nursing home, where untreated incontinence adds significantly to the cost of care. Many people with the problem, young and old alike, are too embarrassed to mention it to their physicians. If and when they do, the doctor, who may also be embarrassed in addition to being unfamiliar with the problem, may dismiss the patient's complaint without much investigation. Among the elderly, the situation is even worse, because so many people, doctors included, incorrectly think incontinence is a normal and uncorrectable consequence of age and illness.", "snippet": "ONE of the earliest lessons children are taught about socially acceptable behavior is that there is a proper time and place for the elimination of body wastes.
