George E. Pataki just as chatter about his political future reached a fever pitch. It swirls around a bill to allow women and girls of any age to get without a prescription a so-called morning-after pill, which can prevent pregnancy after sex. People on both sides of the issue are eager to see whether Mr. Pataki, above, a third-term Republican who supports abortion rights, will sign the bill or veto it. But associates of the governor, speaking on the condition of anonymity, say he is likely to veto the measure as it is now because he has certain objections to it.", "headline": {"main": "Pataki Faces a Dilemma", "kicker": "OFF THE TRAIL: 2005 MAYOR"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 440, "_id": "4fd284bb8eb7c8105d8543c1", "snippet": "Hanging over the becalmed Albany summer is a combustible political issue that lawmakers left for Gov.

Long known for its ardent denunciations of society's obsession with image, the feminist health guide Our Bodies, Ourselves (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, paper, $24.95) turned 35 this year and received a drastic makeover, like a contestant on ''The Swan'' concerned with brow furrows. The ''New Edition for a New Era'' is smaller than the proudly unwieldy editions of the past, with punchier graphics and a pink cover -- a clich\u00e9d feminine color one suspects would've horrified the original authors, who met at a 1969 women's liberation conference in Boston. The old ''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' celebrated the average and anonymous. The new one submits to glitz, with endorsements from the actress Julianne Moore and Eve Ensler, creator of ''The Vagina Monologues'' -- a pet piece of performance art among Hollywood stars. The text includes a disquisition on ''vulva chic'' and the increasing popularity of Brazilian bikini waxes and labioplasties. While the old ''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' would have taken an outraged position toward such oppressive, patriarchal procedures, the new edition blandly tsks at their trendiness and leaves it at that.", "headline": {"main": "A Feminist Classic Gets a Makeover", "kicker": "ESSAY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "27", "word_count": 1284, "_id": "4fd2487b8eb7c8105d7e5391", "snippet": "\"Our Bodies, Ourselves,\" now available in a slick new edition, has come a long way, baby.
