Legions of critics said it was ludicrous for the overweight girls to blame a fast-food company instead of their own nutritional ignorance, lack of willpower, genetic predispositions, failure to exercise or whatever else may play a role in the multifaceted problem of obesity. Commentators and late-night comedians had a field day deriding ''frivolous'' lawsuits, and a federal judge, in dismissing the case in January, explained that ''it is not the place of the law to protect them from their own excesses.'' Yet now the food industry is behaving as if the suit (now amended and refiled), or at least the fast-growing campaign to hold food companies responsible for adverse nutritional effects, may not have been so frivolous after all. Kraft Foods, an industry giant that makes Oreo cookies, Velveeta cheese and Oscar Mayer cold cuts, among other items, announced last week that it would work to reduce the portions in single-serving packages, develop healthier products with the help of experts and eliminate snack-food promotions in the schools. (The company will continue, however, to sell its snacks in school vending machines.) The move was presented as a statesmanlike effort to help combat the obesity epidemic, but analysts suggested that the company was scrambling to take the high road in advance of a potential litigation explosion like the one that staggered the tobacco industry. Kraft is a sister company of Philip Morris and is thus well positioned to understand the legal risks of selling unhealthy products.", "snippet": "Almost everyone laughed when two Bronx teenagers sued McDonald's last year for making them obese.
