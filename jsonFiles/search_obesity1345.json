Often there is no advance warning, and the first sign of trouble is sudden, unexpected death. Yet considerable scientific evidence shows that, while heart disease rarely strikes before midlife, it actually begins in early childhood, with damage occurring for decades before we have any inkling of its presence. Although we may think of childhood as a time of innocence and invulnerability, this is when lifetime habit patterns are formed and the foundations for health are laid. For far too many of us these youthful underpinnings are anything but sound. Screening programs among schoolchildren in various parts of the country show that as many as a third of them can already be described as facing a high risk of premature heart disease. They may have raised cholesterol levels in their blood, high blood pressure, excessive body fat and inadequate exercise habits, and/or they may be cigarette smokers. Many can also be classified as having coronaryprone type A personalities, exhibiting unhealthy reactions to stress.", "snippet": "MOST of us give little thought to protecting ourselves against heart disease until this leading killer strikes a friend or parent or until we ourselves develop signs and symptoms of impaired cardiovascular function.
