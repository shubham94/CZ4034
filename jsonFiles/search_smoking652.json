The issue before them: whether the state should add a provision to Louisiana's drinking law that would prohibit 18- to 20-year-olds from entering bars. The law currently allows them into bars, even while it prohibits them from buying or drinking alcohol. The law is widely flouted, however, and most of the task-force members -- highway officials, state legislators, local sheriffs, a representative from Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) -- were united on the need to change what they saw as a loophole. The loophole, they believed, was encouraging college students to spend their nights carousing rather than studying. They also felt it was contributing to the carnage on the state's highways. In 1995, Louisiana had 883 traffic fatalities, of which slightly more than half were alcohol-related -- the third highest rate in the country. In seeking to close the loophole, however, the task force faced a formidable obstacle: Charles Tapp, one of its members. A lobbyist for the state alcohol industry, the silver-haired, tart-tongued Tapp was on the attack from the moment the first witness was seated. ''You're the executive director of what organization?'' he snarled at Sharron Ayers, who represented the Louisiana Alliance to Prevent Under-Age Drinking, a coalition of grass-roots groups, state agencies and private organizations. Closing the loophole, she said, would make it harder for young people to drink.", "snippet": "Shortly after 9 o'clock on the morning of Dec. 3, 1997, the 14 members of the Governor's Task Force on Driving While Intoxicated and Vehicular Homicide took their seats in a hearing room in the Louisiana State Capitol Building in Baton Rouge.
