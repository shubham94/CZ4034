This vast, glorious piazza promises all sorts of civic delights, but in fact it's one of the few immediately gratifying spots in Trieste. The rest takes time -- exactly what most of us are unwilling to give up. With a convoluted history of serial conquest, culminating in a century-long tug-of-war between Italy and Austria, a melting-pot population, a street plan that ranges from serenely rational to bewilderingly crooked and steep, and a forbidding limestone plateau crowding it down to the waterfront, Trieste is like a modernist novel -- complex, layered, ambiguous. It makes you dig for significance. But don't worry, the story has a happy ending: the patient visitor will go away well satisfied (and wonderfully well fed), rewarded by an experience unavailable to those looking for a quick and easy foreign fix.", "headline": {"main": "The Quiet One"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 3330, "_id": "4fd291418eb7c8105d869fdc", "snippet": "A MEDIUM-SIZE seaport teetering on the edge of what we recognize as Italy, Trieste is a mysterious and puzzling place.
