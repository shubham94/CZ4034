Recommended changes include eating less animal protein and especially less red meat, less animal and dairy fat and fewer egg yolks, and replacing these with more poultry, fish, meatless main dishes, low-fat dairy products, fruits and vegetables. The association also recommended a modest increase in complex carbohydrates (starchy foods) and a reduction in salt. The three-phase scheme starts with the ''prudent diet'' the association has recommended for all Americans since 1961 and progresses when needed to an increasingly strict low-fat, low- cholesterol diet.", "snippet": "The American Heart Association, encouraged by recent proof that lowering high cholesterol can prevent heart attacks, yesterday outlined an aggressive and progressive dietary plan to help Americans lower their blood fat levels.
