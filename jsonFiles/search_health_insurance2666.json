The pageantry around the death of the pope began with a huge public Mass in St. Peter's Square and then the first rites of John Paul's funeral. A1 The next pope faces challenges so urgent that many church leaders and analysts worry that even a pope with the charisma and capacity of John Paul II will have to resort to a strategy of triage. A1 Italy remembered Pope John Paul II formally and officially for his role as the leader of the Catholic Church. Rome's teeming Catholic immigrant community bid an intensely personal goodbye to the man who many said had transformed their lives. A1 The power structure that governed the Roman Catholic hierarchy for the past 26 years has fallen away. At the moment of Pope John Paul II's death, an ultraconservative 78-year-old Spanish cardinal temporarily became the leading decision-maker in Catholicism. A13 Pope John Paul II, in the final hours of his life, lay serene, visitors said, in the expectation that he soon would be in heaven. Interviews with visitors to the pope's bedside and Vatican reports portray him as tranquil and comfortable in the face of death. A12 Arab news cameras and reporters joined the throng focused on St. Peter's Square. Satellite channels are working to be more competitive in covering non-Arab issues. A14 Timetable on Syrian Withdrawal A United Nations envoy said Syria's leaders had promised to pull out all of their military and intelligence forces from Lebanon by the end of the month, before the nationwide elections scheduled for the end of May. The withdrawal of Syrian forces is one of the central demands of the Lebanese opposition. A1 Kashmir Transport Threatened Bus service across divided Kashmir is about to resume, and threats from militant groups operating on the Indian side of the disputed territory have begun to sow fear among would-be passengers. Indian security forces have promised to fortify protection. A4 Assyrian New Year Sanctioned Thousands of Assyrians have converged to openly celebrate their new year in Turkey for the first time. The Assyrian New Year, like many other expressions of minority ethnic identity, had been seen by Turkey as a threat. But this year, the government, with an eye toward helping its bid to join the European Union, has officially allowed the celebration. A6 Iraqi Assembly Appointments The Iraqi national assembly appointed a speaker and two deputy speakers, taking the first step, though a largely symbolic one, toward installing a new government. The leaders of the top political parties settled on a prominent Sunni Arab and the minister of industry in the interim government as speaker. A11 NATIONAL A16-20 A New Brand of Tutoring Grows Largely Unchecked Propelled by the No Child Left Behind law, the federally financed tutoring industry has doubled in size in each of the last two years, with the potential to become a $2 billion-a-year enterprise, according to market analysts. It is virtually without regulation, causing concern among school districts, elected officials and some industry executives. A1 Giving Year for Charities Giving by foundations hit a record last year thanks to gains in asset values and a stream of gifts from philanthropists. An estimated $32.4 billion spilled out of the nation's roughly 66,000 independent, community and corporate foundations in 2004, according to estimates to be released by the Foundation Center. A16 Lobbying on Medicare Cuts Doctors are mobilizing a nationwide lobbying campaign to stave off cuts in their Medicare fees as Congress hunts for ways to rein in the soaring cost of the insurance program. Medicare will cut payments to doctors by 4 percent to 5 percent in each of the next six years, Bush administration officials say. A20 Suit Over Same-Sex Benefits Michigan has become the focus of attention with the filing of a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union in which 21 same-sex couples ask the state courts to clarify whether a recent court ruling that gay and lesbian state workers should be ineligible for health benefits for their partners in future contracts means the loss of their benefits. A16 Salinas Races to Save Library Unless Salinas, California can raise $500,000, the John Steinbeck, Cesar Chavez and Gabilan Libraries will be shuttered, victims of the city's $9 million budget shortfall. Residents, writers and celebrities staged a read-in over the weekend. A16 An Embattled Delicacy Restaurants have removed foie gras from their menus because of protests by animal rights advocates, who say the techniques used to produce it should be outlawed. Opponents persuaded the California Legislature last year to pass a bill that will ban foie gras in 2012 unless producers can prove the technique is humane. A17 SCIENCE/HEALTH New Guidelines for Cancer Risk The E.P.A. has issued new guidelines for determining whether a chemical causes cancer in humans. Agency officials say that they will take into account a larger array of scientific data before declaring that a substance has carcinogenic properties, a risk assessment that takes a step back from previous guidelines.
