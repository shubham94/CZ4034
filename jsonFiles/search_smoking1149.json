They have begun a series of experiments and studies that so far have led them to believe that indoor levels of several pollutants, especially nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and airborne particles, ''may at times exceed'' Federal standards for the quality of air outside. In the current issue of the laboratory's bulletin, Prof. B.B. Kebbekus writes that, although the outdoor atmosphere ''has been the subject of vast monitoring campaigns during the past two decades, indoor air is perhaps more relevant to human health.'' Professor Kebbekus said that nitrogen oxides from the burning of natural gas in stoves and other appliances, as well as particulates from cooking, smoking, cleaning and dusting, ''also can exceed the levels commonly found in congested urban areas.''", "snippet": "NEWARK BECAUSE people spend 80 to 90 percent of their time indoors - at home, at work, shopping and traveling - researchers at the New Jersey Institute of Technology's air-pollution monitoring laboratory here believe that the quality of indoor air is..."}], "meta": {"offset": 0, "hits": 1, "time": 25}}}
