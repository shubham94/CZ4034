As strains of the tubercle bacillus have become resistant to the drugs that have long controlled the infection, tuberculosis has once again become a deadly disease in the United States, as well as in less developed countries. Only a few years ago, the United States Government set the year 2010 as the date for eliminating tuberculosis from this country. But now Federal health officials say the disease is out of control in several areas of the country, including New York City, where it has become a major problem in hospitals and homeless shelters and among people who are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes the disease, has become resistant to as many as seven drugs.", "headline": {"main": "Mechanism Explained For Drug Resistance In Some TB Strains"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 1254, "_id": "4fd1bdb98eb7c8105d6ea9b1", "snippet": "TUBERCULOSIS researchers have made a laboratory discovery that they say paves the way for the development of new and more powerful drugs against the infectious disease, which has become a growing public health threat throughout the world.
