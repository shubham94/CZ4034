Previous ''Twilight'' exposure: A friend once discussed ''the pregnancy scene'' with Judge because she needed to get it off her chest. Name the four ''Twilight'' books. Something about an apple? The titles are mostly about fruit. One is called ''Breaking Dawn,'' I think, but I could be conflating zombie television. What do you mean? Like, am I mixing up ''Breaking Bad'' or ''Walking Dawn''? Or ''Walking Dead''? You know, to make ''Breaking Dawn''? [Correct answer: ''Twilight,'' ''New Moon,'' ''Eclipse,'' ''Breaking Dawn.''] You might be. Who plays Edward Cullen? Oh! It's that pale kid. Possibly -- is his name Justin? [Correct answer: Robert Pattinson.] Why is Alice in a mental institution? Something about her being pregnant with a vampire baby. [Correct answer: She was having visions of the future.] What are the people in the diner thinking about when Edward reads their minds? How pale he is. [Correct answer: Money, sex and, in one case, a cat.] Who is Jacob? Jacob is a sexy werewolf! [Correct answer: Sexy werewolf.] Everyone knows that one. Yeah! Because of the whole Team Edward vs. Team Jacob thing. Also, Jacob reminds me of Anthony Kiedis in the ''Under the Bridge'' video. Why don't the Cullens eat people? Maybe a person was nice to them once and so they're mainstreamers, like in ''True Blood'' or ''Buffy''? Wait, is Edward's last name Cohen? [Correct answer: They're ''vegetarian'' vampires. They eat animals instead.] Cohen? No. Cullen. With an ''l.' 'Oh, I was going to say maybe it's not kosher. What happens to Twilight vampires in the sun? They're very shiny? They look like marble, like the Lincoln memorial. [Correct answer: They sparkle.] What human sport do vampires play? Lacrosse. Because they're European. [Correct answer: Baseball.] Team Edward or Team Jacob and why? Team Jacob because all of Edward's weird, sappy, sad, virginy, purity, shiny crap is crap.
