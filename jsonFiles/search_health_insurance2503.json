[Page A1.] Skilling Maintains Innocence Despite Mistakes at Enron Jeffrey K. Skilling admitted in testimony at the Enron fraud trial that he made mistakes, but continued to profess his innocence and blasted the government for charging him with conspiring to defraud Enron investors. [C1.] Repeat of an Auto Bailout Unlikely This Time Just over 25 years ago, Chrysler teetered on the brink of bankruptcy, hobbled by falling sales, heavy payroll costs and bloated debt, and the federal government helped with a bailout. Today General Motors and Ford are in similar positions. But a replay of the federal help is unlikely. [C1.] The Ford Motor Company said it planned to shut its truck plants in St. Paul, Minn., and Norfolk, Va., the latest closings as part of its restructuring program called the Way Forward. Both plants, which are among the oldest at Ford, will shut in 2008, the automaker said. Both opened in 1925 and together employ about 4,300 hourly and salaried workers. [C4.] Pension Accounting Plan Will Cut Corporate Worth A proposal by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to revise the way corporations account for pension obligations would wipe away 8 percent of the nation's corporate wealth, reflecting how poorly current accounting rules reflect a pension fund's need for cash versus a company's ability to provide it, according to a study by an actuarial firm. [C1.] A Chip Maker Turns His Focus to the Sun T.J. Rodgers, who founded Cypress Semiconductor to make high-speed computer memories and the newer specialized chips that go into iPods and high-end Mercedes Benzes, is working on a new kind of chip these days, the kind that soak up the sun's rays to produce electricity.

[C3.] Fidelity Closing Two More Popular Mutual Funds Fidelity Investments said it was closing two large, popular mutual funds to new investors, two weeks after closing its biggest fund, the $65 billion Contrafund. Some analysts interpreted the closings as pre-emptive steps to prevent sagging returns that can result when a fund gets too big. [C5.] Michael Jackson Overhauls His Finances The pop star Michael Jackson, who has been burdened with hundreds of millions of dollars of debt, said he had revamped his finances, an arrangement that would probably force him to sell part of his stake in a song catalog that includes hits by the Beatles. [C2.] General Electric Posts 9% Increase in Profit General Electric said its earnings increased 9 percent in the first quarter and that revenue rose 10 percent as the company benefited from stronger sales of aircraft engines and health equipment. Jeffrey K. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, said the company expected a strong year -- orders are up 33 percent overall and 67 percent for equipment. G.E. said it should also be able to sell the last of its slower-growing insurance businesses, GE Life, in the next 12 months. [C3.] Anticipation of Technology Profit Lifts Stocks Stocks rose as anticipation of better-than-expected earnings from technology companies tempered concern about higher interest rates and oil prices.

The ad, a 30-second spot, is being shown on cable and network television in New York City, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo and Albany. Mr. King's campaign staff did not disclose how much is being spent for the commercials. PRODUCER -- Jay Rabinowitz, Surreal Communications. ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with Mr. King standing outdoors in a blazer and an open-collar shirt, with trees in the background. It then slowly zooms in on a black-and-white photograph of Mr. King at age 7, with his father, mother and younger brother. Mr. King then describes his concerns about the medical care provided to his father, who died of cancer in 1994. The ad continues with Mr. King in 2006, sitting and strolling while speaking with various people, in suburban-looking yards and on streets. It ends with Mr. King speaking into the camera. THE SCRIPT -- Mr. King narrates the ad, telling viewers: ''I'm Charlie King. I'm running for attorney general. And here's one reason why: My father was my hero. When he died from cancer, I wondered whether he received the best medical care possible. As attorney general, I'll fight to make sure medical decisions are made by you and your doctor, not by insurance companies that deny necessary treatment.'' The ad then returns to Mr. King among various New Yorkers as he says: ''You can help, too. Join my people's campaign and share with me your stories of insurance company abuse. Together we can make New York better.'' At that point, a man speaks in support of Mr. King, saying, ''We're with you, Charlie.'' At the conclusion, Mr. King looks into the camera and says, ''I'm Charlie King, running for attorney general.'' SCORECARD -- By emphasizing his family, specifically his father's death from cancer, Mr. King takes the safe route of focusing on medical care, an issue that his campaign staff suggests resonates with all New Yorkers. Mr. King's appeal to New York residents to call or write in with personal examples of health care claim denials are meant to tap into voter discontent over the health care system. In a six-candidate Democratic primary battle that has been dominated by Andrew M. Cuomo, the former housing secretary, and Mark Green, the former New York City public advocate, the King ads are intended to raise the candidate's visibility. Mr. King is hoping to heighten his recognition among the large number of voters undecided about the attorney general's race. JONATHAN P.
