When the chemistry fizzles, as in the teaming of Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston in ''Along Came Polly,'' the only thing produced is an irritating heat rash. Watching these two go at it is almost as uncomfortable as observing the 60-something Woody Allen nuzzling a beauty less than half his age. Theoretically the notion of Mr. Stiller as a phobia-ridden risk assessor for an insurance company loosened up by Ms. Aniston as a carefree daredevil isn't wholly implausible. But this flat romantic comedy, written and directed by John Hamburg (one of the writers of ''Meet the Parents'' and ''Zoolander'') fails to provide any reason a spunky free-spirited girl-next-door like Ms. Aniston's character, Polly Prince, would give Reuben Feffer, Mr. Stiller's uptight nerd, a second glance. True, Reuben is a nice Jewish boy, but as we all know, nice has nothing to do with hot. Reuben is so obsessed with statistics that he counts the seconds to himself as he makes love and makes personal choices based on a device that analyzes data and spews out percentages.", "headline": {"main": "A Romance Battles the Odds: Risk Assessor Woos Daredevil", "kicker": "FILM REVIEW"}, "abstract": "Stephen Holden reviews movie Along Came Polly, written and directed by John Hamburg and starring Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston; photo (M)", "print_page": "6", "word_count": 698, "_id": "4fd235278eb7c8105d7c6a8d", "snippet": "Quirky romantic pairings are always a risky gamble in Hollywood, but out of those rare occasions when the odd-couple friction sets off the kind of sparks generated by Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn in ''The African Queen,'' movie legends are...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/16/movies/film-review-a-romance-battles-the-odds-risk-assessor-woos-daredevil.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "ALONG CAME POLLY (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HAMBURG, JOHN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "STILLER, BEN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ANISTON, JENNIFER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Stephen", "lastname": "HOLDEN"}], "original": "By STEPHEN HOLDEN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2004-01-16T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Movies; Arts"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "lead_paragraph": "New York City's Correction Department spent an average of nearly $59,000 per inmate in the 2003 fiscal year.
