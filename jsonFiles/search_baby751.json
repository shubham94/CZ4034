One is on the floor, waving his legs in the air, doing yoga. The other is a grouchy-looking middle-aged guy in tasseled loafers, slacks and a duffel coat he hasn't bothered to take off. He sits hunched, moodily sipping red wine, quite oblivious to the serene first-class space, with its subdued motif of the Orient. He's trying to control his temper. His name is Tom Stiffler. He sports a green-faced watch with golf clubs crossed at the stroke of noon, and he's a top executive for an automobile company. He's on his way to Germany and he has just about had it. He has come in to Chicago today from St. Louis. He was supposed to be flying through Atlanta on TWA to Stuttgart but there was a cancellation. Now, if nothing else goes wrong, he'll be landing at 6 a.m. in Frankfurt, where he'll jump into a car for a high-speed autobahn drive to make a meeting he doesn't believe he needs to attend. ''My trip today is happening because it makes people feel better when they can touch someone,'' he says. ''But if you need to see me once a week, you don't need me. You need a baby sitter.''", "headline": {"main": "Nowhere, U.S.A."}, "abstract": "Richard Rayner article on business travelers at O'Hare International Airport, Chicago; notes goal of many airports is to convince business travelers that they never need leave airport at all, making downtown cities they serve redundant; photos (L)", "print_page": "42", "word_count": 4572, "_id": "4fd216c28eb7c8105d7919ac", "snippet": "In the United Airlines first-class lounge at O'Hare International Airport, there's sushi for lunch and only two travelers in evidence.
