She was a 49-year-old, diabetic computer operator from Nutley, N. J., with a lifelong smoking habit and a blood-starved left ventricle. The extremity of her condition had been driven home a week earlier by a crashing heart attack. She was wheeled into Operating Room 21 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center at 7:30 A.M. For the next eight hours her life was in the hands of blue-and-green-gowned nurses, physician-assistants, anesthesiologists and surgeons of various rank and experience who cut veins out of her legs, sawed her sternum in half, spread her ribs and then made way for Dr. Mehmet Oz, probably the most accomplished 35-year-old cardiothoracic surgeon in the country. He strode into the arena in his rubber clogs, hands upraised, ready for a sterile towel, latex gloves and the delicate work of securing a future for Donadio's faltering heart. At the invitation of Oz and his patient, there were two other people on hand in surgical gowns and masks: a second-year medical student named Sally Smith, stationed at Donadio's feet, and a 52-year-old healer named Julie Motz, who was standing at Donadio's head. As volunteers in Oz's Cardiac Complementary Care Center, they worked for free through the operation, seldom moving except to reposition their hands. As Oz requested sutures and clamps and units of lidocaine, Motz called softly to Smith to move her hands from the small toe of Donadio's right foot to a point on the sole known as \"the bubbling spring.\"", "snippet": "JOYCE DONADIO HAD ARRIVED AT THE confluence of paradigms.
