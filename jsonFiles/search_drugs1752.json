And despite their higher cost -from two to five times as much as popular supermarket brands - business is booming, retailers say. Caswell-Massey, the Manhattan pharmacy, sells between 5,000 and 10,000 packages a year of one product alone, ''Monkey Brand Black Toothpowder,'' from India. Foreign cachet is only part of the appeal. The products look and taste different from ordinary brands, transforming routine brushings into unusual sensory experiences. In addition, some are free of the artificial colors, flavors and sweeteners that health-conscious consumers often object to even in minute quantities (although there is no evidence that such ingredients are harmful when used in accepted quantities). It is the absence of fluoride in most of these products, however, that concerns some experts. Fluoride, studies have shown, is effective in protecting teeth from dental caries. In other cases, ingredients found in these dentifrices remain unrecognized or unevaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration and dental authorities. This new melange of toothpastes generally falls into two categories: those of foreign manufacture, which may contain ingredients not found in American toothpastes, and American-made ''natural'' products, which differ in formulation from leading brands.", "headline": {"main": "Beauty; TAKING A PASTING"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "68", "word_count": 1659, "_id": "4fd1374e8eb7c8105d609b90", "snippet": "Containing unfamiliar ingredients from distant corners of the globe -including Indian tree-bark extracts and a scarlet dye made from tropical insects - exotic toothpastes vary widely in color, flavor and composition.
