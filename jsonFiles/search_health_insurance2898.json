Leading labor attorney and former Chairman of Proskauer Rose, whose commitment to the firm helped to fuel its growth and worldwide reputation, died on October 1, at his home in Greenwich, CT. The cause was cancer. Born in New York City's Hell's Kitchen, Edward graduated with distinction from Cornell Unversity Law School, where he was Managing Editor of the Law Review, having previously served as an aerial navigator in World War II, earning recognition for his courage in combat over the Pacific. He joined Proskauer in 1948 and immediately distinguished himself in the field of labor relations, earning the respect of both management and labor. He served as a member of the Labor Committee of the New York City and State Bar Associations and on the New York City Board of Collective Bargaining for 23 years. Edward was appointed special labor counsel to the City of New York by former mayors Lindsey, Beame, Koch and Dinkins. He was also a former Director and member of the Executive Committee of the American Arbitration Association and served as an arbitrator until the time of his death. Edward was a consummate New Yorker, tall and gracious, whose intellect, kindness, sense of humor, and passion for fairness will be missed by all who kenw him. He is survived by his loving wife Marlys, and his adoring children from his former marriage to Melba Silver, Ann, Erik, Owen, and Adam, daughterin-law Carlotta Mast Silver, and grandson Eli Edward Silver. A memorial service will be held at 10:30 am, on Thursday, October 7, 2004, at the American Museum of Natural History, entrance on Columbus Ave at 79th St. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to charities dedicated to securing equal rights and educational opportunities for those less advantaged. SILVER--Edward. The partners, counsel, senior counsel, associates and staff of Proskauer Rose LLP mourn the loss of our esteemed senior partner and former chairman Edward Silver. Having joined Proskauer as a young associate in 1948, after graduating from Cornell Law School, where he was the managing editor of the Cornell Law Review, Ed set his sights on labor-management relations from the very start, and went on to enjoy a 40-year career as one of the country's preeminent labor lawyers. Ed represented some of the nation's largest employers, serving a wide range of clients in almost every industry, including telecommunications, broadcasting, publishing, transportation, health care, brewing, maritime, and insurance. Although Ed was a ''management - side'' labor lawyer and a skilled and successful negotiator, he enjoyed the respect, if not admiration, of those on the ''other side of the table'' because of his fairness, decency and unswerving integrity--qualities that he prized above all others. Ed was a key figure in the labor affairs of New York City and was appointed by three mayors as a City representative to the Board of Collective Bargaining. He also served as special labor counsel to the City and participated for twenty years in negotiations representing municipal employees. Ed also served as Arbitrator in the settlement of outstanding issues in the 1983 Metro North strike. Noting his important role in New York City labor relations, The New York Times applauded Ed for his ''tough, fair bargaining'' and referred to him as a ''muchneeded pro.'' Ed's leadership and sense of fairness and decency also served Proskauer well. As Chairman of the Firm until 1991, Ed helped to change the Firm's management style by bridging the generations. A visionary and true pioneer, Ed was also instrumental in the Firm's 1990 move to Manhattan's West Side. Ed was a Director and Member of the Executive Committee of the American Arbitration Association; a Member of the New York City Commission on School Facilities and Maintenance Reform and a Director of the Citizens Budget Commission. Ed served on the Labor Committees of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, the American Bar Association and the New York Country Lawyers' Association. A life-long champion of the underdog, Ed received the Judge Learned Hand Human Relations Award from the American Jewish Committee in 1984 and the 1988 B'nai B'rith International Distinguished Achievement Award.

The National Basketball Association is deeply saddened by the loss of Edward Silver, beloved father of our colleague Adam Silver. Loving husband of Marlys Silver and devoted father of Ann, Erik, Owen and Adam, he was preceded in death earlier this year by his first wife and mother of his four children, Melba Silver. Edward Silver will be remembered as one of the nation's leading labor lawyers and as the former Chairman of Proskauer Rose, one of the country's most prominent law firms. Over the span of 48 years with Proskauer Rose, Ed counseled his clients, including the NBA, with wisdom, integrity and devotion. All the members of the NBA Family send their heartfelt condolences to Adam and his family. A service to celebrate the life of Edward Silver will be held in New York at the Museum of Natural History on Thursday, October 7, at 10:30 AM. The entrance is on Columbus Avenue at 79th Street.
