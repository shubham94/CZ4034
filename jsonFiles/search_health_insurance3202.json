He wanted to reassure a skittish financial community worried that cascading stories of malfeasance by big business will further undermine public confidence. Mr. Bush recently talked of looking for inspiration in another president who led the nation in an era of corporate wrongdoing: Theodore Roosevelt. But Mr. Bush might not realize that Roosevelt was far more radical than any Republican of today. In fact, Roosevelt advocated a restructuring of government-business relations more radical than most Democrats now seek. While President Bush has proposed relatively minor reforms -- like hiring additional S.E.C. regulators -- these look tame when compared to Roosevelt's calls for a fundamental government intervention in the economy. He wanted national incorporation to make sure no corporation stayed in business if it violated the law repeatedly. He called for strict regulation of the stock market and a stronger Federal Trade Commission. He said he would like nothing better than to force companies to open their books to federal investigators and to make executives personally liable for jail when their corporations broke the law. The government should act like a referee, throwing cheaters out of the game to ensure fair play.", "headline": {"main": "The Nation; For T.R., Government Was the Solution"}, "abstract": "Kathleen Dalton article contrasts ex-Pres Theodore Roosevelt's battle for government regulation to battle corporate malfeasance with Pres Bush's free-market-age sensibilities; photo (M)", "print_page": "5", "word_count": 736, "_id": "4fd21d8a8eb7c8105d79e89a", "snippet": "PRESIDENT Bush went to Wall Street on a mission last week.
