That question has preoccupied a growing number of scientists in recent years, as well as many of us who exercise. In the late 1990s, Dr. Fred Gage and his colleagues at the Laboratory of Genetics at the Salk Institute in San Diego elegantly proved that human and animal brains produce new brain cells (a process called neurogenesis) and that exercise increases neurogenesis. The brains of mice and rats that were allowed to run on wheels pulsed with vigorous, newly born neurons, and those animals then breezed through mazes and other tests of rodent I.Q., showing that neurogenesis improves thinking.", "headline": {"main": "Phys Ed: Your Brain on Exercise", "kicker": "Well"}, "abstract": "A number of new studies have begun to tease out the specific mechanisms and, in the process, raised new questions about just how exercise remolds the brain.", "print_page": null, "word_count": 864, "_id": "4fd39ba18eb7c8105d8da5bb", "snippet": "A number of new studies have begun to tease out the specific mechanisms and, in the process, raised new questions about just how exercise remolds the brain.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/your-brain-on-exercise/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Gretchen", "lastname": "REYNOLDS"}], "original": "By GRETCHEN REYNOLDS"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2010-07-07T00:01:28Z", "section_name": "Health"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National", "lead_paragraph": "After years of effort to coax empathy from machines, robots and devices designed to soothe, support and keep us company are venturing out of the laboratory.", "headline": {"seo": "Discovering a Soft Spot for Circuitry; Robot Machines as Companions", "main": "A Soft Spot for Circuitry", "sub": "Machines as Companions ;", "print_headline": "SMARTER THANK YOU THINK; Circuitry With a Feel for Humanity", "kicker": "Smarter Than You Think"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": "2405", "_id": "54182eae79881018c379083a", "snippet": "After years of effort to coax empathy from machines, robots and devices designed to soothe, support and keep us company are venturing out of the laboratory.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/05/science/05robot.html", "multimedia": [{"subtype": "xlarge", "url": "images/2010/07/05/us/05robot1_span/05robot1_span-articleLarge.jpg", "height": 330, "width": 600, "legacy": {"xlargewidth": "600", "xlarge": "images/2010/07/05/us/05robot1_span/05robot1_span-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargeheight": "330"}, "type": "image"}, {"subtype": "thumbnail", "url": "images/2010/07/05/us/05robot1_span/05robot1_span-thumbStandard.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2010/07/05/us/05robot1_span/05robot1_span-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": "75"}, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "Robots", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Artificial Intelligence", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Elder Care", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Dementia", "is_major": "N", "rank": "4", "name": "subject"}], "byline": {"contributor": "", "person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Amy", "lastname": "HARMON"}], "original": "By AMY HARMON"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2010-07-05T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Science"}, {"type_of_material": "Blog", "blog": [], "news_desk": null, "lead_paragraph": null, "headline": {"main": "10 Ways to Use NYTimes.com for Research", "kicker": "The Learning Network"}, "abstract": "Going beyond Site Search: tips for finding information on virtually any topic of academic, personal or professional interest on the Times Web site.", "print_page": null, "word_count": "909", "_id": "5230738979881007d5916e52", "snippet": "Going beyond Site Search: tips for finding information on virtually any topic of academic, personal or professional interest on the Times Web site.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/10-ways-to-use-nytimes-com-for-research/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": "Education", "keywords": [], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Holly", "middlename": "Epstein", "lastname": "OJALVO", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2010-07-01T12:40:00Z", "section_name": "U.S."}], "meta": {"hits": 3, "offset": 0, "time": 30}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
