But it was also abundantly clear that no one was thinking of inviting Lassie in for a snack of milk and Lick 'n Crunch treats (Oreo-style cookies from Three Dog Bakery, made with carob instead of chocolate, which is bad for dogs) or of decking her out in a Swarovski-crystal heart-shaped dog tag, or of painting her nails with Opi's Pawlish. You can be just as sure that Timmy wasn't saving up his allowance to buy Lassie a $14 squeaky toy Chewy Vuitton or Jimmy Chew and that his mother wasn't stretching the household budget to cover Le Chien et Le Chat cedar-scented laundry detergent. No, Lassie belonged to an honorable but almost-extinct breed of household pet, one that knew its place in the family of man.
