The steps of the cloth painting are described in detail. Nakunte chooses the whitest cloth in the marketplace and then makes mud ''black as a starless night.'' She proceeds to draw with her painting stick, explaining to the child in her womb. ''Listen, my baby, do you hear the drums that call?'' she asks, drawing a border of drums. ''Mmmmmmmm, the calabash flower smells so sweet. Can you smell the sweetness, my baby?'' she says, as flowers appear on the intricate bogolan.
