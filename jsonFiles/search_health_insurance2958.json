After effectively paralyzing emergency rooms at Wheeling Hospital, Ohio Valley Medical Center and Weirton Medical Center for almost two weeks, most of the surgeons returned to work on Jan. 13, after legislation was introduced to amend malpractice liability language and lower the cap on damage awards for pain and suffering. That bill, which has passed the House of Delegates, is now under review in the West Virginia Senate. Many surgeons have said that if it fails, they'll walk out again -- or simply look for jobs in other states. Their protest has already inspired some of their peers: surgeons in coastal Mississippi have just walked out, and doctors in New Jersey are planning a slow-down this month. Loch Adamson Stephen Alatis, orthopedic surgeon, Weirton: ''I was born and raised in Weirton. Whenever I spoke to other doctors, they kind of smirked at the fact that I was actually back in West Virginia. They thought I was an idiot for coming back.'' Dante Marra, orthopedic surgeon, Wheeling: ''Everything is in my wife's name. I can't even participate in the American dream of owning a home, because it would be fair game for a trial attorney.'' Eduardo Esper, cardiothoracic surgeon, Wheeling: ''We're not prepared, having spent all night with a patient, for that patient to come back and sue us. And the majority of the time, those suits are promoted by lawyers that I believe are greedy.'' Patrick Rosario, cardiothoracic surgeon, Weirton: ''Nobody lives forever. Once you get that concept into the system -- that and that just because somebody gets a bad result doesn't mean that there should be a lawsuit -- it'll be great.'' Ahmad Rahbar, cardiothoracic surgeon, Wheeling: ''I did not take the Hippocratic oath to practice medicine in this environment. I am always looking at the patient as sort of a potential enemy -- and that is not a healthy situation to be in.'' Robert Zaleski, orthopedic surgeon, Wheeling: ''I made a decision to come back to my hometown, Wheeling, in 1980 and be part of my roots.
