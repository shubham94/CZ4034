A persuasive, insistently leftist indictment of the American health care system, as well as a funny valentine to all things French -- and many things Canadian, British and Cuban -- the film shows that while Mr. Moore remains a radical partisan, he has learned how to sell his argument with a softer touch. He's still the P. T. Barnum of activist cinema, but he no longer runs the entire circus directly from the spotlight. To that shrewd end almost an entire hour has lapsed before Mr. Moore lumbers in front of the camera in ''Sicko,'' his aw-shucks grin and baseball cap firmly in place. By that point he has introduced a wealth of evidence (photographs, news clips and archival footage) and a sprawling cast of characters (patients, health care workers and Washington politicians), each another piece in the evolving puzzle. How did we get here and why?, Mr. Moore asks in his faux-folksy, at times icky-sticky voice-over. Though of course there's never any doubt that this director of ''Bowling for Columbine,'' a blistering attack on American gun culture, believes he knows who is to blame for the state of the nation's health care and why.", "headline": {"main": "Aw, Shucks!
