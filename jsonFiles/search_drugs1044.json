And it was inevitable that once enough people were on these regimens, problems would emerge. The inevitable has occurred. New prescriptions for fenfluramine (the ''fen'' of the fen-phen combo) increased by 6,390 percent in the last four years, and last year the total number of prescriptions for fenfluramine and phentermine (the ''phen'' of the combo) exceeded 18 million. There are no sales figures yet for Redux, or dexfenfluramine, which has been sold in this country since June 1996, but they too are likely to be stratospheric. Serious Health Problems The big news, however, is not that Americans have shrunk significantly with the aid of these drugs. The average weight loss in a year's time has been only about 20 pounds, 5 1/2 pounds more than was achieved by dieting alone, and some or all of the weight is regained when the drugs are stopped. The drugs work mainly by curbing people's appetites and bingeing tendencies and making it easier for them to resist high-calorie foods.", "headline": {"main": "Obesity drugs: Weighing the risks to health against the small victories.", "kicker": "Personal Health"}, "abstract": "Jane E Brody Personal Health column on evaluating risks to health of weight-loss drugs known as fen-phen and Redux (M)", "print_page": "9", "word_count": 1175, "_id": "4fd1fee08eb7c8105d760141", "snippet": "WITH one-third of Americans seriously overweight and perhaps half of them desperate to achieve a healthier and more socially acceptable size, it was inevitable that the weight-loss drugs known as fen-phen and Redux would take the country by storm....", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/03/us/obesity-drugs-weighing-the-risks-to-health-against-the-small-victories.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "WEIGHT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REDUX (DRUG)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "OBESITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FENFLURAMINE (DRUG)"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Jane", "middlename": "E.", "lastname": "Brody", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By Jane E.
