The gathering concern was evident in the Surgeon General's extraordinary plea last week that children be frankly told about sex, drugs and AIDS. Although recent studies have shown conclusively that the virus that causes AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, can pass between men and women through ordinary intercourse, important questions remain about how easily the virus spreads this way, how often it already has and whether a major epidemic among heterosexuals is likely. So far, the proportion of the country's AIDS cases attributable to heterosexual contact remains small. Some experts fear that the AIDS virus is spreading insidiously among heterosexuals and that a surge in cases is in store. Because of the estimated average lag of at least five years between a patient's infection with the virus and diagnosis of the deadly disease, the experts note, statistics on current disease patterns could be dangerously lulling.", "headline": {"main": "HETEROSEXUALS AND AIDS: THE CONCERN IS GROWING"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2048, "_id": "4fd170d58eb7c8105d663f0a", "snippet": "HEADING off the proliferation of AIDS among heterosexuals has begun to preoccupy many health officials, who recognize that past ignorance and inertia allowed the fatal disease to course through the populations of homosexual men and intravenous drug...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/28/science/heterosexuals-and-aids-the-concern-is-growing.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Erik", "lastname": "ECKHOLM"}], "original": "By ERIK ECKHOLM"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1986-10-28T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Science; Health"}, {"type_of_material": "Review", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Book Review Desk", "lead_paragraph": "WHEN TEENAGERS WORK The Psychological and Social Costs of Adolescent Employment.
