A new research report published last week in the journal Science challenges the view that dialysis treatments help schizophrenics, but proponents of dialysis argue that the study is inconclusive and that more research is needed. Dr. Herbert Wagemaker, director of psychiatry at the University of Louisville Hospital in Kentucky, says that he has several patients in research projects who have been ''doing very well for eight or nine years on maintenance dialysis'' treatment for schizophrenia. ''There are only three or four days a year when their symptoms break through and require medication,'' he said.

The waste of a life at a young age is deeply disturbing, but it is made even the more poignant as many parents almost unavoidably identify with the loss. When two young boys attending the same school died 10 days apart in Dix Hills, L.I. recently, there was even more than the usual community pain. It was possible, at least in the minds of the parents and some doctors, that some deadly contagion was in the air. The parents not only identified with the loss of other parents but imagined it happening to themselves. Although health officials stressed that no public health threat was at hand, the reassurances did not salve the fear of most parents. In fact, a panic that drew national attention ensued. Throughout this period, health officials had to stay sensitive to that panic but still keep a tight lid on their own emotions so that they could go about their painstaking medical work. Scores of pathological and other tests were needed to determine if the two deaths were linked. Additional virological and bacteriological tests were needed to rule out an unrecognized outbreak of a communicable disease.", "headline": {"main": "BRINGING CALM TO THE TRAGEDY IN DIX HILLS", "kicker": "THE DOCTOR'S WORLD"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1349, "_id": "4fd1104c8eb7c8105d5c5c57", "snippet": "Almost nothing touches people as much as the death of a child.
