''Sitting Fit Anytime,'' with Susan Winter Ward, Yoga for the Young at Heart, $19.95 for VHS (43 minutes), (800) 558-9642 or www.yogaheart.com. For a nation of couch potatoes, here comes the ultimate workout: seated yoga. Seated yoga is not as lazy as it may seem, however, because the cure lies or, for that matter, sits, in the cause: too much sitting creates aches and pains. But doing yoga while sitting heals them. New Age logic, to be sure, but the exercises in ''Seated Yoga,'' featuring Carol Dickman, and ''Sitting Fit Anytime,'' with Susan Winter Ward, are surprisingly effective. And relaxing. ''If you focus 100 percent on what you are doing, you will receive 100 percent of the benefits,'' advises Ms. Dickman, a woman who would have us all be impressively polite to our body parts. ''Invite your head to start to move,'' she intones. ''Allow your eyes to close.'' As for our shoulders, we ought to ''invite them to remain relaxed.'' ''Invite your entire body to relax,'' she proposes. Wholeheartedly taking her up on the invitations, I promptly fell asleep. I had been performing the postures, or exercises, on my bed, so much better for sleeping than my chair at work, my car, a bus, my sons' hockey arenas or any of the other places I could be sitting and doing yoga. On awakening, I am happy to report, I heard Ms. Dickman soothingly command, ''Let go of any judgments,'' for then I knew that she would never judge me harshly for slipping into slumber. And who was I to judge anyone, anyway, especially since my head was spinning from the neck-circles as well as from the accolades on the video box by that renowned yogi Raquel Welch, who gushes that the lithe, dark-haired Ms. Dickman is ''endlessly resourceful and an excellent coach.'' For me, endlessly resourceful and excellent is an exercise called the Mess Around, in which you make circles with your torso, loosening up all those limbs and whatnot. Other stretches untied the knots, accumulated from hunching over my computer keyboard, that were holding my neck and upper back hostage. Ms. Winter Ward, whose long gray hair is as wiry as her body is agile, directs her video to ''beginners, baby boomers and seniors.'' In ''Sitting Fit Anytime,'' which might be subtitled ''And Anywhere,'' we are asked, ''How much time do we spend sitting each day?'' Plenty! So don't just sit there! Roll your head, your hips, your ankles. Sitting, she says, puts stress on your lower back. The solution? Stretch. Arms up, reach for the sky. Put one ankle over your knee and stretch forward. Lace your fingers between your toes and squeeze. And, of course, breathe. I'm not quite sure what my boss would think if I suddenly sat back and shot my legs way up in the air, but I know my hamstrings would be delighted.", "headline": {"main": "No Yoga Studio Nearby?
