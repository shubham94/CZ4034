Scientists have documented insomnia, depressed immune function, greater susceptibility to heart attacks and elevated levels of corticosteroids, the so-called stress hormones, in recently bereaved people. But a bereaved person is by definition someone who has lost an intimate. Is it even possible that vicarious grief -- grief for people you have never even known -- can afflict the body as well? Two public-health researchers, Ralph Catalano and Terry Hartig, believe it can. They have introduced a term -- communal bereavement'' -- for what they call ''the widespread experience of distress among persons who never met the deceased.'' Catalano, a professor of public health at the University of California at Berkeley, and Hartig, a lecturer in the psychology department at Uppsala University in Sweden, were not conducting their empirical research in the aftermath of Sept. 11, but the applications to it are obvious. In the weeks after the terror attack, it was clear that sadness had become, among other things, a public-health problem: pharmacies reported filling more prescriptions for antidepressants; doctors observed that chronic-pain patients were suddenly complaining of flare-ups. In a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press the week after Sept. 11, 71 percent of Americans said they felt depressed, and 23 percent said they had been suffering from insomnia.

The landmark case concerned an 18-year-old boy whose mother came down with German measles while she was pregnant with him. Since doctors failed to diagnose this illness, the mother went ahead and had the child, who is now deaf, mentally retarded and nearly blind. The court's decision to award the boy damages has stirred up an impassioned debate among French politicians, lawyers and philosophers, and with good reason. Even if the mother's measles had been detected, the boy's handicap could not have been prevented -- only his birth. That might have been better for the parents, who could have simply waited a few months and started another pregnancy. But would it have been better for the boy himself never to have existed?
