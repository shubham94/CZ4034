Their studies ask whether in the long run the benefits of vigorous exercise outweigh its risks, particularly with regard to the heart. Thus far, researchers say, their studies show that while strenuous activities like jogging can sometimes precipitate a heart attack, over a lifetime exercise directly lessens the chances of heart attack and premature death, even for people who have already suffered one heart attack. The studies also show that to be most protective, exercise should be ''vigorous.''", "snippet": "AS physical fitness increasingly becomes an American passion that is pursued  at times to the point of injury and even death, researchers are racing to clarify its effects on health and longevity and the physiological mechanisms that may account for...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "FIXX, JAMES", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "HEART", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "LONGEVITY", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "EXERCISE", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "RESEARCH", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "1", "type_of_material": "Series", "word_count": 2395, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
