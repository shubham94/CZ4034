''I don't feel like a one-man trend,'' he said. ''It's just that my wife makes more than I do, and we couldn't live on my salary.'' Mr. Parisi is the first man working for the New Jersey Bell system - and one of the few men in America - to take advantage of a paternity-leave program. For six months, he was a ''househusband'' in his apartment in Hackensack, N.J., while his wife, Kathy, a supervisor for New Jersey Bell, went back to work last May, two months after the baby was born. Mr. Parisi is one of many fathers being scrutinized by a team of investigators in a $350,000 international study of male parenting by the Fatherhood Project of the Bank Street College of Education in Manhattan. Funded by the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Family Fund and the Levi Strauss Foundation, the two-year project is the first systematic attempt to determine the extent of the ''new fatherhood,'' the phenomenon of increasing male involvement in child rearing.", "headline": {"main": "PATERNITY LEAVE: A NEW ROLE FOR FATHERS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "18", "word_count": 1550, "_id": "4fd117e08eb7c8105d5cfc91", "snippet": "Vinny Parisi dandled his 10-month-old daughter, Dana, and talked about what it feels like to be studied by researchers, hailed as a pioneer and seen as the embodiment of a ''new phenomenon'' in fathering.

By Arthur Levitt Jr. As with most people who buy their own businesses, the odds against Robert Johnson were high. He was confronted at the start with an intimidating list of problems. He had no money, after laying out the purchase price, with which to start building up the business; he had no business experience or training, and he didn't know where to go for advice (beyond the help offered by the local Internal Revenue Service office on how to fill out 10 different Government reporting forms). There were no tax breaks, no Government loans, no expense accounts. Although he purchased the company from his uncle for what he thought was a good price, most everyone else would not have regarded it as a bargain. The Chicago business - Gamecraft of Illinois, which designed and produced board games - had been barely surviving since it was founded in 1968. Sales were declining, and stacks of bills were unpaid. What Johnson did have was a strong conviction that his energy and imagination would make the business succeed. ''My sense of my own worth became tied up in it,'' he says.
