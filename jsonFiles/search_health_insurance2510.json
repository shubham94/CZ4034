Poultry from bird-flu-infected countries has been banned in Europe but smuggling seriously undermines those bans, says Gen. Emilio Borghini, commander of the Military Police Health Service in Italy. A1 Berlusconi Suffers Setback Silvio Berlusconi's fight to remain prime minister of Italy suffered a possibly fatal blow, after the Interior Ministry announced that there were not enough contested ballots to overturn the thin victory of his challenger, Romano Prodi. A6 Iran Promises End to Israel President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran said that Israel is a ''constant threat'' and predicted that it was on the verge of ''being eliminated.'' A7 U.S. Program to Reshape Iran A new office of Iranian affairs in the State Department is poring over applications for a program to change the political process inside Iran. The plan, not yet approved by Congress, would include scholarships, exchange programs, radio and television broadcasts and other activities aimed at shaking up Iran's political system. A7 Israel Threatens Gaza Strip Israeli generals threatened to re-invade the Gaza Strip if Palestinian rocket attacks continued, keeping up a war of words and weapons even as Jews, Muslims and Christians celebrated their holy days. A7 Tensions Mount in Africa With the unrest in Sudan's Darfur region spreading into neighboring countries, Chad broke off relations with Sudan and threatened to oust 200,000 Sudanese refugees after staving off a rebel incursion into its sand-strewn capital. A3 NATIONAL A9-11 Bush Supports Rumsfeld, Despite Generals' Critique President Bush offered his full support to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in an effort to quell widening calls from retired generals who have urged that Mr. Rumsfeld resign his post. A1 Ruling on Arrests of Homeless A three-judge federal appeals court panel ruled that arresting homeless people for sleeping, sitting or lying on sidewalks and other public property when other shelter is not available was cruel and unusual punishment. The ruling essentially invalidates a Los Angeles ordinance. A9 Professor to Be Deported Federal authorities have decided to deport a former Florida professor and Palestinian rights activist, who was indicted in 2003, after failing to convict him on charges he helped finance terror attacks in Israel. A10 Bushes Report 2005 Income The president and Laura Bush reported adjusted gross income of $735,180 for last year and paid federal income taxes of $187,768, slightly less than in 2004, according to a copy of the couple's 2005 return released by the White House.

A1 Agent Was Cleared in 1976 Thirty years ago, a retired F.B.I. agent, R. Lindley DeVecchio, now charged with aiding in mob murders was accused of selling handguns to undercover officers.

B1 Beliefs B6 SPORTSSATURDAY D1-6 Whispers Grow, Bonds is Silent The embattled Barry Bonds ignored reporters who descended upon him in Los Angeles as the San Francisco Giants prepared to play the Dodgers. Bonds was a bigger story than the game because he faced new questions about a federal grand jury investigating him for perjury. D1 ARTS B7-16 A Hit Show for Beckett at 100 In the surprise hit show of Ireland's monthlong festival celebrating Samuel Beckett, who was born on April 13 100 years ago, the star does not say a word. The popularity of ''Eh Joe,'' a relatively unknown 1965 script, has been one of many pleasant revelations during a month in Dublin where Beckett is inescapable. B7 BUSINESS DAY C1-7 Exxon C.E.O.
