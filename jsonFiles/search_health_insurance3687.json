Decline; Dow Jones Rises 17 Points The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.34 points, to 2,552.65, as trading was slow and investors awaited the meeting Tuesday and Wednesday of the Federal Open Market Committee. Investors expect the Federal Reserve's policy-making panel to raise short-term interest rates a quarter percentage point to head off inflation. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.47 point, to 1,315.31, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.73 points, to 10,552.56. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond declined to 6.15 percent from 6.16 percent on Thursday. [Page C3.] Economy Growing at a 4.3% Rate Torrid consumer spending helped the gross domestic product -- the nation's output of goods and services -- grow at a brisk annual rate of 4.3 percent in the first quarter of the year, the Commerce Department reported. [C4.] Priests Say They Were Duped In Rome, two priests, the Rev. Peter Jacobs, 73, an American, and Monsignor Emilio Colagiovanni, 79, a scholarly Italian, provided a clerical cloak of respectability for a money manager who authorities suspect embezzled more than $300 million from American insurance companies. Both men insist they were duped by Martin R. Frankel, who disappeared last month and is wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. [A1.] Campbell Earnings to Fall Short Campbell Soup said that earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter would fall 8 cents to 10 cents a share below analysts' forecasts of 38 cents a share and that it planned to reorganize its soup operations. Mark M. Leckie, the president of the company's domestic soup division, will leave the company. He will be succeeded at the new North American division by F. Martin Thrasher, now the company's president of European and Canadian operations. [C4.] Nissan's Western-Style Meeting In Japan, where annual shareholders' meetings, are traditionally closed affairs, Nissan Motor moved to Western-style openness, allowing news coverage. But the reward for the troubled company's president, Yoshikazu Hanawa, left, was a scolding gadfly shareholder who identified himself only as Mr. Tamura and demanded his resignation, saying, ''You've made mistake after mistake.'' Next Tuesday, 1,374 companies, or 88 percent of Japan's listed companies, are to hold their meetings. [C2.] Latin-European Trade Meeting Set Seeking to increase trade and gain a counterweight to American global economic dominance, leaders of Latin America and Europe, the world's second- and third-largest trading blocs, are to meet in Rio de Janeiro this weekend and early next week. Their summit meeting, their first, has already proved contentious on several basic issues, notably French insistence that farm products be excluded from any free-trade pact. [C2.] In Indonesia, a Step Toward Health In Indonesia, the agreement this week between PT Astra International and its creditors on how the big company, which assembles Toyota utility vehicles and Honda motorcycles, will pay back more than $1 billion in debt is being heralded as evidence that the nation is on the mend. But Indonesia is by no means well. [C2.] BBC's New Head Stirs Controversy The British Broadcasting Corporation stirred passionate debate by appointing as its new head Greg Dyke, a millionaire Labor Party supporter associated with ''Baywatch'' and a puppet called Roland Rat. He has been head of Pearson Television, but the Conservative opposition focused on his Labor ties.
