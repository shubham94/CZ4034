It has upgraded warning signs, sirens, evacuation routes, and seismically reappraised bridges and buildings. Now, the community is trying to become the first to build a $4 million seismically sound evacuation tower that could rise over the crest of even 18-foot tsunami waves. While California is often seen as the epicenter of earthquakes in the country, new studies show that parts of the Pacific Northwest, stretching from Northern California to British Columbia, are at even greater risk of a catastrophic earthquake lasting as long as five minutes.
