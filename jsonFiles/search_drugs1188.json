It may seem an act of considerable vanity for a chicken farmer to build himself a copy of the President's office. But Don Tyson is a realist to his thick fingertips, as befits a man who presides over the largest abattoir the world has ever seen -- every week, Tyson Foods reduces 25 million chickens to plucked and gutted shadows of their former selves -- and he sees politics as a series of unsentimental transactions between those who need votes and those who have money. His office decor is an accurate, not immodest statement about where, in a world where every quid has its quo, power lives.", "headline": {"main": "The President's Past"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "20", "word_count": 12575, "_id": "4fd1dbfd8eb7c8105d71d245", "snippet": "A good place to begin thinking about how Bill Clinton became who he is today  is the Arkansas town of Springdale, where a short, red-faced man known as Mr. Chicken sits in a room modeled after the Oval Office of the President of the United States...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/magazine/the-president-s-past.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CLINTON, BILL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Michael", "lastname": "Kelly"}], "original": "By Michael Kelly"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1994-07-31T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine; Washington"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "National Desk", "lead_paragraph": null, "headline": {"main": "A Closer Look at the Two Plans", "kicker": "THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: COMPARE AND CONTRAST"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "8", "word_count": 630, "_id": "4fd1c0c88eb7c8105d6ef313", "snippet": null, "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/30/us/the-health-care-debate-compare-and-contrast-a-closer-look-at-the-two-plans.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CLINTON, BILL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REFORM AND REORGANIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEALTH INSURANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Monica", "lastname": "BORKOWSKI"}], "original": "By MONICA BORKOWSKI"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1994-07-30T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; U.S."}], "meta": {"hits": 2, "offset": 0, "time": 48}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
