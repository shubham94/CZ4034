That was the underlying theme of the latest episode of \u201cFriday Night Lights,\u201d as we watched Epyck lash out, fight and get suspended and Buddy\u2019s son roll into town with his quasi-vegan-induced anger and disillusionment.

It seems to take Buddy Jr. about 10 seconds of being in Dillon to steal his father\u2019s credit card and break into the booze and another 20 for everyone to figure that the cure for what ails Buddy is going to be two-a-days. I\u2019m already feeling too optimistic about Buddy\u2019s future, and I don\u2019t want to feel optimistic.
