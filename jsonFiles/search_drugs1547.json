The agency is working with the Reagan Administration's Office of Management and Budget to prepare the specifications for the expected $11.7 billion cut in this fiscal year's budget. ''The thing is purposely designed to have an unappealing result, and it will,'' he added. The measure, which sets deficit ceilings that decline to zero by 1991, was signed into law in December.

''No Grand Inquisitor has in readiness such terrible tortures as has anxiety,'' wrote Soren Kierkegaard in ''The Concept of Dread,'' ''and no spy knows how to attack more artfully the man he suspects, choosing the instant when he is weakest, nor knows how to lay traps where he will be caught and ensnared, as anxiety knows how, and no sharpwitted judge knows how to interrogate, to examine the accused, as anxiety does, which never lets him escape, neither by diversion nor by noise, neither at work nor at play, neither by day nor by night.'' Kierkegaard, Donald W. Goodwin writes in his new book, ''discovered anxiety in 1844.'' Surely, there were individuals before that who suffered from the unfortunate afflictions of anxiety - what Rollo May called ''a nameless and formless uneasiness,'' a vague, persistent feeling of ''uncertainty and helplessness.'' In 1621, Robert Burton expounded upon similar varieties of psychic distress in ''The Anatomy of Melancholy''; in the same century, Pascal wrote of the despair that accompanies man's realization that his life is ''swallowed up in the eternity before and behind it.'' Still, it was with the progressive loss of faith in the old certainties of religion and reason, that anxiety -along with dread and alienation - became elevated into a philosophical concept used to define the condition of modern man.", "headline": {"main": "Books of the Times; Fears and Phobias"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": 908, "_id": "4fd156558eb7c8105d63aaa6", "snippet": "ANXIETY.
