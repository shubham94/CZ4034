Temperatures plunged below 30 degrees, threatening to ruin the fluffy, delicate blossoms that covered the apple groves like a pinkish-white blanket. Growers wandered all night through their orchards, hooking up rows of heaters on the ground and hovering overhead in helicopters to force the warm air earthward. The Crist Brothers Orchards, a $1.5 million operation that spans 103 years and four generations of Crists, was able to defeat the frost. But the threat of frost pales in comparison to that posed by a rancorous controversy over a farm chemical that, until recently, has been used widely by Mr. Crist, as well as by many of the country's 15,000 apple growers. The 23-year-old product, known as daminozide and marketed under the trade name of Alar by Uniroyal Inc., is a plant growth regulator: It makes apples redder and firmer and enables an entire apple crop to ripen uniformly for easier harvest. It also lengthens the fruit's storage life.", "headline": {"main": "POLISHING THE APPLE'S IMAGE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": 2118, "_id": "4fd15a528eb7c8105d63fb25", "snippet": "FOR Roscoe Crist, a snowy haired apple grower in New York's Hudson Valley, the first weekend in May was an unusually frightening one.
