Indicative of the trend, for the first time since the survey began in 1975 the number of seniors who say they have tried marijuana has actually declined. Although use of drugs remains extremely high, the leader of the study, Dr. Lloyd Johnston of the University of Michigan, discerns a ''gradually increasing conservatism'' among teen-agers and says, ''The dramatic rise over the last two decades in the proportion of young people involved with illicit drugs appears at or very near an end.'' A similar trend toward a leveling off of drug use has been reported by the military. The study, a yearly sampling of about 17,000 seniors throughout the country that is sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, found significant changes in patterns of use from 1979 to 1980. Daily use of marijuana, the most widely used substance, was down by 12 percent, though nearly one in 10 seniors still said they smoked it daily.", "snippet": "Use of illicit drugs by young people in this country shows clear signs of leveling off, according to the results of a survey of high school seniors reported today.
