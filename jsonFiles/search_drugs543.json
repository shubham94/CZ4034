A1 As the Senate prepares for a bitter debate about whether to begin pulling troops from Iraq, Senator John Kerry insists on setting a date for all American combat troops to be withdrawn, frustrating some Senate Democrats who say in interviews that his new stand may complicate their hopes of taking back a majority in Congress in 2006.

Behind the News -- Last fall, it seemed that an indictment on perjury charges was imminent for Mr. Rove, the president's senior adviser, as part of the leak investigation. The decision not to charge him eliminates a major distraction for the White House and allows Mr. Rove to focus on the midterm elections. But a cloud hangs over the executive branch: I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff and the only person charged in the investigation, is expected to go on trial on perjury and obstruction of justice charges in January. Mr. Cheney may be called to testify. PLEADED The News -- Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of prescription drugs. Behind the News -- Mr. Kennedy, 38, the son of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was sentenced to court-ordered drug treatment and probation in connection with a late-night car crash last month near the Capitol. After the accident he denied he had been drinking, announced he was addicted to prescription painkillers and checked into the Mayo Clinic for a month of treatment. For Mr. Kennedy, it was the latest in a long line of revelations of personal troubles; the effect on his standing among the voters of his home state is yet to be seen. APPEALED The News -- The Supreme Court made it easier for death-row inmates to challenge states on the issue of lethal injection. Behind the News -- The justices ruled in the case of Clarence E. Hill, above, a Florida inmate who had been scheduled for execution last January for the killing of a police officer. The court said Mr. Hill could challenge Florida's method of lethal injection under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, an appeals route with few obstacles. Death penalty opponents have questioned whether the drugs used eliminate pain. If not, they say, it is a cruel and unusual punishment. In their ruling, the justices gave no indication of where they stand on the issue. FREED The News -- Abu Bakar Bashir, an Islamic cleric linked to the bombings of two nightclubs in Bali three years ago, was released from an Indonesian prison. Behind the News -- American officials said they were disappointed in the release of Mr. Bashir, whom they consider to be an important operative for Al Qaeda. Mr. Bashir had served a little over a year of a 30-month sentence after being convicted of conspiracy in connection with the bombings, which killed 202 people. The judges in the case said Mr. Bashir knew the perpetrators and may have encouraged them. But as he returned to his hometown there were signs his influence may be waning: the crowd that welcomed him was far smaller than expected. SUED The News -- KFC was sued by a nutrition advocacy group seeking to have it stop using partially hydrogenated oils in its fried chicken and other foods. Behind the News -- The lawsuit by the Center for Science in the Public Interest came after the group had unsuccessfully petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to require warning signs in restaurants regarding use of the oils, a major source of trans fats, which nutritionists consider unhealthy. KFC said the suit was frivolous and that the company took health issues seriously. It said it was reviewing the use of alternative oils, but that maintaining the flavor of the original Colonel Sanders fried chicken recipe was important.", "headline": {"main": "Legal Notes From All Over | June 11-17", "kicker": "THE WEEK"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 594, "_id": "4fd2783a8eb7c8105d83a868", "snippet": "CLEARED    The News -- The special prosecutor in the C.I.A. leak case decided not to bring charges against Karl Rove.
