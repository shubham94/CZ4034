My friend has had deep-vein thrombosis, is obese and has high blood pressure. I say we should take the train. Can you help? Susie Young, Toronto The best advice I can give is for your friend to consult her doctor. Deep-vein thrombosis is a serious health hazard and, in spite of what the airlines may say, there is published medical research to indicate a link between the condition and flying. It is clear that lack of movement, cramped seats and reduced air pressure in the cabin have a combined impact on blood-clotting mechanisms. And obesity is an additional risk factor, according to Dr. Richard Dawood, a Londoner who specializes in travel-related medicine. At an altitude of 30,000 feet, the cabin is pressurized to 8,000 feet, the equivalent of sitting on top of a mountain. The low cabin air pressure makes your heart and lungs work harder and can be dangerous for people prone to strokes or who have heart problems.", "snippet": "I am having difficulties finding out what illnesses can affect whether someone should fly or not.
