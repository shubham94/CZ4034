In 1967, the first full year of the Medicaid program, Federal and state payments totaled $1.5 billion. To deal with what the Reagan Administration terms the ''unconstrained growth'' of Medicaid, which is now the fastest growing program in most state budgets, President Reagan has proposed limiting Federal contributions to the program in the hope of saving $1 billion in the fiscal year 1982 and up to $5 billion annually by 1986.", "headline": {"main": "U.S. LIMIT ON MEDICAID WOULD SHIFT BURDEN TO STATES"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "12", "word_count": 1526, "_id": "4fd121d88eb7c8105d5e4350", "snippet": "At the close of a long Congressional debate in 1965 over a bill assuring medical care for the aged, a hastily written measure was tacked on to deal with health care for the poor.
