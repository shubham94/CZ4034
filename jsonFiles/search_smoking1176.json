Over the same period, the report said, deaths caused by contraception or sterilization have begun to occur at nearly the same rate as they do from pregnancy itself. The lesson to be drawn from the data, the report said, is that health problems associated with birth control must receive increased attention, not because such practices have become more dangerous but because they are being used by more women. The study, by Federal epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, is believed to be the first to have been done in this country on both birth control practices and the complications of pregnancy.", "snippet": "The total number of women who died in pregnancy or in efforts to avert pregnancy or childbirth has decreased dramatically in recent decades, according to a report published in today's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.

In first grade, I was a member of a four-kid gang that went around imitating TV Westerns. We'd disrupt class to play out scenes, picking up chairs and hitting people over the head with them - except, unlike on TV, the chairs didn't break, the kids did. Finally, the teacher called my parents in and said, 'Obviously, he's being influenced by these TV shows, and if he's to continue in this class, you've got to agree not to let him watch television anymore.' So, from first to second grade there was a dark period during which I didn't watch TV at all. And I calmed down and the gang broke up.'' What's notable about this memory is that it was recounted, in the course of a Playboy interview this month, by Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC. For it is top-ranking network executives who have long permitted the level of violent programming to remain so high, despite inexorably mounting evidence that violence on television begets violence in real life.", "snippet": "''Television did have an effect on me right from the beginning.
