Other light fare - it generally contains about a third fewer calories than comparable products - that is to appear soon includes potato chips, snack foods, fruit drinks and cookies. Industry executives and market analysts predict that the upsurge of light foods, which has been under way for two years, will continue and they venture that when the scramble to offer new products is over, low-calorie foods could constitute up to 10 percent of the $300 billion American food market.
