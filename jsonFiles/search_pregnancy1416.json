The parents who devote hours each night to the ritual of their children's bedtimes. The children with roomfuls of toys who complain of nothing to do. The parents whose phone conversations are really interruptions interrupted by conversation. The children who won't do their homework unless their parents are nearby. The parents who intervene on their children's behalf whenever a teacher delivers a bad grade, a rebuke, a punishment. The children so incapable of dealing with frustration they explode in rage whenever something goes any way other than theirs. The parents who acknowledge their children's fury; ''I see you're angry,'' they say, until they, too, become so frustrated they cannot reprimand except by screaming. The children who think of no one but themselves. The parents who think of no one but their children. These are the parents, and these are the children, whom John Rosemond would expunge from the national fabric. Among an ever-growing group of usually conservative, often Christian givers of authoritarian child-rearing advice, he is the expert of the moment, largely because of a recent public dispute with T. Berry Brazelton over the timing of toilet training. But Middle America saw his day coming long before the potty wars hit the papers. Twenty years ago, Rosemond (''Train them by 2!'') was a family therapist in Gastonia, N.C., with an occasional article in the local paper. Today, his weekly column appears in about 150 newspapers. His practice boarded up, the 51-year-old Rosemond wanders the country eight months of the year, the Johnny Appleseed of discipline, putting on nearly 250 shows annually. He publishes a bimonthly magazine, Affirmative Parenting. He operates a Web site. And his eight books, which have sold a total of more than a million copies, have experienced a 30 percent increase in sales over each of the last two years. There's more in the works: an infomercial to market a ''take it home'' effective-discipline kit; a series of nine hourlong programs being developed for possible placement on PBS; a series of ''news'' segments to be marketed to television stations. In the fall of '99 you'll even be able to take a cruise with John Rosemond. And when you return home, if he has done his job, you will, in his words, ''fling open the door and say, 'Hey, kids, things will never be the same!'
