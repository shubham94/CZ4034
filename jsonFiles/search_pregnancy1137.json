Two for the Title TENNESSEE (31-4 Last Season) The joy fades in Knoxville when the Lady Vols don't win the N.C.A.A. championship, and it fades even more when Connecticut wins instead. UConn beat Tennessee in last season's final, but this could be a year for change. Tennessee returns three gifted starters -- the 6-foot-2 senior F Shyra Ely, the 5-10 junior G Shanna Zolman and the 5-9 senior PG Loree Moore -- and possibly the best freshman class ever. The best of the six freshmen, the 6-3 F Candace Parker, is recovering from leg surgery. Coach Pat Summitt said, ''They are quick learners, but sometimes I go home and I feel like a first-grade teacher.'' LOUISIANA STATE (27-8) The best player in women's college basketball may be Seimone Augustus, L.S.U.'s 6-1 junior guard. Last season, she averaged 19.4 points a game and made 52.8 percent of her shots, and Coach Pokey Chatman said, ''When she touches the ball, something special is going to happen.'' Chatman took over for Sue Gunter, who retired after 44 seasons. She has five solid freshmen, led by the 6-5 C Sylvia Fowles. The 5-3 point guard Temeka Johnson said, ''It's just a good feeling about this team, like a feeling that I've never had before.'' Two More for the Final Four CONNECTICUT (31-4) After winning the past three national titles and four of the past five, UConn faces life without the all-American Diana Taurasi. The best returning players are the 6-foot junior F/G Barbara Turner, the 6-2 junior G Ann Strother and the 6-3 senior C/F Jessica Moore. Plenty of talented freshmen join them, including the 5-7 PG Ketia Swanier. Coach Geno Auriemma said, ''I think we have a chance to be pretty good.'' Translation: Anything short of the Final Four will be disappointing. TEXAS (30-5) All starters return, except for the workhorse center Stacy Stephens. And without Stephens, there will be more movement on the perimeter. The key worker inside will be the 6-foot-3 sophomore F Tiffany Jackson, and the 6-5 sophomore C Kalee Carey must be a force, too. If those two succeed, the 6-2 senior F Heather Schreiber and the 5-6 senior PG Jamie Carey will be even more effective from 3-point range. Anyone who expects to beat the Lady Longhorns must be ready to run with them. Four More at the Door GEORGIA (25-10) Year in and year out, the Lady Bulldogs are a top team, but never a national champion. This version, deep in the backcourt, needs help upfront, especially with the 6-foot-5 C Christi Thomas having graduated. The 6-3 freshman Tasha Humphrey must learn quickly how to dominate the boards. NORTH CAROLINA (24-7) After watching Duke win the past five Atlantic Coast Conference tournaments, Carolina thinks it is ready to take over. This team has good defense and needs outside shooting. The best players are sophomores: the 6-foot-1 F Camille Little (14.3 points a game) and the 5-6 PG Ivory Latta (14.0). STANFORD (27-7) The graduation of the all-American F Nicole Powell may actually help, because this team is more athletic and may be harder to defend. ''We have a very different team,'' Coach Tara VanDerveer said. It is laden with seniors, including a secure backcourt in the 5-foot-9 Kelley Suminski and the 5-7 Susan Borchardt. DUKE (30-4) Alana Beard, the all-American guard, is gone, and the 6-foot-3 junior C Mistie Williams sees a positive in that: ''To be able to play as a team and not have to focus on one player will be great.'' Williams and the 6-foot junior G/F Monique Currie become the mentors for a strong group of freshmen. Eight Ready To Soar OHIO STATE (21-10) Plenty of talent, but the 6-foot-5 sophomore C Jessica Davenport is the only tall veteran inside. The 5-9 sophomore G Brandie Hoskins and the 5-9 senior G Caity Matter run a sound backcourt. BAYLOR (26-9) A team on the way up. The best players are the 6-foot-1 junior F Sophia Young (16.7 points, 8.6 rebounds) and the 6-2 senior C Steffanie Blackmon (15.6 and 6.9 rebounds). MINNESOTA (25-9) Point guard Lindsay Whalen, last year's star in the Final Four, is gone, but C Janel McCarville, a 6-2 senior workhorse, is back, broken left hand and all. The newcomers are excellent. TEXAS TECH (25-8) A final-16 team for the past five seasons. Should be a contender again, especially with the 6-foot-5 senior C Cisti Greenwalt returning from illness. NOTRE DAME (21-11) The 6-foot-2 senior F Jacqueline Batteast has scored in double figures in 72 of her 90 games. PG Megan Duffy, a 5-7 junior, is a 3-point shooter who needs backcourt help. VANDERBILT (26-8) The 6-foot-3 sophomore F Carla Thomas leads a team with only two seniors. Graduation took Jenni Benningfield and Hillary Hager, the key scorers. PURDUE (29-4) Shereka Wright and Erika Valek must be replaced, and Purdue has been effective at reloading. Two sophomores -- Katie Gearlds and Erin Lawless -- are the keys. BOSTON COLLEGE (27-7) The 6-foot-4 F Kathrin Ress of Italy, who played nothing like a freshman in last year's postseason, returns. So does the 5-9 senior G Jessalyn Deveny, who is dangerous from the outside. Long Shots? Here Are Five RUTGERS (21-12) Although the senior F Shalicia Hurns is gone because of legal problems and the senior G Cappie Pondexter is out until January for personal reasons, talented freshmen may carry the Scarlet Knights. VILLANOVA (23-7) An always dangerous ballcontrol team that Coach Harry Perretta said would be ''a little bigger and a lot slower.'' DEPAUL (23-7) The 6-foot-2 junior F Khara Smith (20.4 points, 11.7 rebounds) returns to the nation's highest-scoring team (84.4 points a game). PENN STATE (28-6) The senior Tanisha Wright and the 5-7 senior Jess Strom make a fine backcourt, but how do you replace Kelly Mazzante? Coach Rene Portland is out on medical leave. LOUISIANA TECH (29-3) The Lady Techsters will be better when the 5-foot-10 junior G Erica Smith-Taylor, their top returning scorer, comes back in January after pregnancy.", "headline": {"main": "The Favorites", "kicker": "COLLEGE BASKETBALL OUTLOOK"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "word_count": 1011, "_id": "4fd244358eb7c8105d7dddae", "snippet": "Frank Litsky handicaps this season's top teams.

The series, which appeared on weekdays from 1974 to 1989, was aimed at latchkey kids -- the ones who, as women entered the workplace, had to fend for themselves after school. Rather than treat the captive demographic to escapist fantasies, ABC addressed the kids with macabre parables on social issues, the kind that affected children who weren't, say, getting enough attention from their parents and were furious about it. A selection of the early specials -- those produced by Martin Tahse from 1974 to 1977 -- have recently been released on DVD. Shot mostly on location in a shadowy style, and characterized by the shuffling, soundtrack-free sequences that used to dominate nonstudio television before digital editing, the early After School Specials often seem like film-school projects -- awkward, visually ambitious and full of near-hysterical emotionalism.", "headline": {"main": "The Sins of the Fathers (and Mothers)", "kicker": "TELEVISION: DVD"}, "abstract": "Virginia Heffernan reviews DVD collection of ABC's After School Specials, series that appeared from 1974 to 1989; photo (M)", "print_page": "30", "word_count": 593, "_id": "4fd257118eb7c8105d800c48", "snippet": "Monstrously neglectful parents are everywhere in ABC's After School Specials, a selection of which have recently been released on DVD.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/arts/television/05heff.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2004/12/05/arts/05heff.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2004/12/05/arts/05heff.75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "AFTER SCHOOL SPECIALS (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MCNICHOL, KRISTY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDINGS (VIDEO)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Virginia", "rank": 1, "lastname": "HEFFERNAN"}], "original": "By VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2004-12-05T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts"}, {"type_of_material": "Letter", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: Re ''Trying to Avoid 2nd Caesarean, Many Find Choice Isn't Theirs'' (front page, Nov. 29):", "headline": {"main": "Giving Birth: The Caesarean Debate"}, "abstract": "Dr Marc Siegel letter responds to Nov 29 article; says he does not believe that issue of whether vaginal delivery should be performed in pregnancy after prior Caesarean should be framed as matter of woman's right to choose", "print_page": "12", "word_count": 196, "_id": "4fd280958eb7c8105d84bcad", "snippet": "To the Editor:    Re ''Trying to Avoid 2nd Caesarean, Many Find Choice Isn't Theirs'' (front page, Nov. 29):", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EED81731F936A35751C1A9629C8B63", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "SIEGEL, MARC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CAESAREAN SECTION"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2004-12-05T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Letter", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: I was lucky enough to give birth to my daughter in July at a wonderful small hospital where the practice is made up of four certified nurse-midwives and two ob-gyns.", "headline": {"main": "Giving Birth: The Caesarean Debate"}, "abstract": "Emily Bloch letter notes that she gave birth to her daughter in July 2004, and had medication-free birth even though she was in active labor for 24 hours; drawing0", "print_page": "12", "word_count": 213, "_id": "4fd254e68eb7c8105d7fcf10", "snippet": "To the Editor:    I was lucky enough to give birth to my daughter in July at a wonderful small hospital where the practice is made up of four certified nurse-midwives and two ob-gyns.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00EED81731F936A35751C1A9629C8B63", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BLOCH, EMILY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRICS"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2004-12-05T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Review", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Book Review Desk", "lead_paragraph": "SPIRIT AND FLESH Life in a Fundamentalist Baptist Church.
