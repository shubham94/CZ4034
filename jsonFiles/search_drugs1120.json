Brock is a 32-year-old journalist who has taken the 60's counterculture credo that the personal is political and given it a whole new meaning -- describing Anita Hill as \"a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty\" and interviewing Arkansas state troopers about Bill Clinton's sex life. He'd invited to his place perhaps two dozen men and women in their 20's and 30's and early 40's who, like him, made their living trying to tear down the liberal establishment, or what remains of it. There were editors from The American Spectator -- the country's most raucous journal of conservative opinion. It was in The Spectator that Brock published his savaging of Hill (later expanded into a best-selling book) and his \"troopergate\" allegations about the President. To judge by his elegant French-cuffed shirt, let alone the town house, his association with The Spectator hadn't hurt him.", "headline": {"main": "The Counter Counterculture"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "32", "word_count": 5058, "_id": "4fd1ecab8eb7c8105d73e5b2", "snippet": "IT WAS COCKTAIL HOUR ON THE OPENING DAY of the new, Republican-dominated Congress, and the long, chandelier-lighted parlor of David Brock's town house in Georgetown was filling up with exuberant young conservatives fresh from events on the Hill....", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/magazine/the-counter-counterculture.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By James Atlas;"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1995-02-12T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "lead_paragraph": "In contract after contract, American doctors and hospitals are agreeing to be paid for their services in a way that many of them once thought unthinkable.
