That cow, identified only as No. 133 in a British government report, died two months later, as others on the same farm fell ill. An autopsy on one in 1985 found its brain full of holes, like a sponge. Sick animals turned up on other farms, and by 1986 the British knew they were facing an epidemic of a terrible new cattle disease. By 1994, the illness had spread to people, probably from eating beef. So far, the number of human cases has remained relatively small, 137, mostly in England, out of millions there who may have eaten contaminated meat. But the disease inspires fear because it is fatal, the incubation period is uncertain, people have no way of knowing they have been infected until they get sick and the symptoms are horrific. The disease attacks the brain, leaving a person mentally and physically helpless. Many victims were young, including some in their teens and 20's.", "headline": {"main": "Sheep Ailment May Hold Clues to Mad Cow Disease"}, "abstract": "Mad Cow disease, emerging for first time in 1984 in West Sussex (England) and spreading to humans where it caused variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, may be controllable using same theory of genetic markers used to breed sheep resistant to similar prion disease scrapie; University of California, San Francisco, neurologist Dr Stanley B Prusiner theory of misfolded proteins called prions and earlier research studies on brain disease Kuru discussed; impact of Mad Cow disease and scrapie on livestock imports and feed practices in effort to reduce spread and potential human transmission outlined; US program to have American scrapie-free by 2007 discussed; photo; drawing (M)", "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1299, "_id": "4fd29b088eb7c8105d87ab2f", "snippet": "No one knows for sure when or where the first cow went mad, but the first recorded case occurred in December 1984 when a dairy cow on a farm in West Sussex began to stumble around and act strange.
