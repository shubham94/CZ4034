For 50 years, patients with advanced stages of rheumatoid arthritis have had the option of being injected with a liquefied gold compound. Now, the SmithKline Corporation appears close to introducing the first oral form of a gold compound for treating rheumatoid arthritis, the most serious form of arthritis. The drug ranks among the most anxiously awaited new medications to enter the advanced stages of Government review in recent years. The reason for high hopes is that the drug, which SmithKline calls Ridaura, could greatly expand the use of gold treatments among the nation's five million rheumatoid arthritis patients. Many of these patients, a group that spans all age brackets but is largely composed of elderly people, have been unable to withstand the side effects of gold injections, which include nausea and other gastrointestinal problems that can be as debilitating as the disease itself. As a result, phyicians are reluctant to prescribe the treatment even among relatively young and robust patients. In almost all cases, gold injections are regarded as a drug of last resort.", "headline": {"main": "THE GOLD BUG BITES SMITHKLINE", "kicker": "WHAT'S NEW IN PHARMACEUTICALS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "21", "word_count": 1742, "_id": "4fd123f18eb7c8105d5e8418", "snippet": "They do not know why it works, but physicians have ample proof that gold can be effective in reducing the crippling, and eventually fatal, symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.

Just as consumer advocates and health groups were unleashing a new round of criticism of the Government's ability to keep harmful medications off the market, the Reagan Administration announced a plan June 23 to shorten the Food and Drug Administration's 20-yearold review process by about 20 percent. The announcement came six days after consumer advocates petitioned the Government to prohibit the sale of benoxaprofen, an antiarthritis drug sold by Eli Lilly & Company under the brand name Oraflex, which had been inconclusively linked to the deaths of nine Americans. The deaths, occurring as they did in the first few months after the drug was marketed, raised questions about the quality of the F.D.A.'s review of its safety. Even before approval in this country, more than 30 deaths in Britain were loosely linked to Oraflex, but the agency was not aware of them. Britain suspended sales last month and Lilly then withdrew it from the market. The Background Most aspects of the Oraflex case, including scientific and legal issues, are still under investigation; many people in the F.D.A. and outside experts say it represents an isolated instance. The handling of the medication by the agency did disclose basic administrative problems, such as a department's six-month delay in opening its mail, poor communication with the British authorities and, apparently, poor enforcement of rules requiring manufacturers to report adverse reactions in other countries.", "headline": {"main": "SPEEDING F.D.A.
