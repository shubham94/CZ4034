The popular children's books ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' by Roald Dahl and ''Chocolate Fever'' by Robert Kimmel Smith presaged the current best seller, Sandra Boynton's ''Chocolate: The Consuming Passion'' (Workman, $4.95), an amusing closer-to-fact-than-fiction tribute to that universally coveted derivative of the cacao bean. After the beans were carried to the Old World in the 16th century by a Spanish adventurer who got them from the Aztecs, the prized cache was kept secret for years by the Spanish nobility, who believed chocolate to be an aphrodisiac. In 1775 the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus gave the cacao tree the genus name Theobroma, Greek for ''food of the gods.'' Today chocolate candy is a favorite gift of lovers, and chocolate flavoring is a popular enticement to get children to drink their milk or swallow their medicine. Though times are hard - or, perhaps, because they are hard - chocolate is enjoying greater popularity than ever. Consumption of other candies and snack foods is down, but that of chocolate continues to climb - up more than 8 percent in 1981 over 1980. Americans consume nearly two million pounds of chocolate and chocolate-type candies a year, a third more than any other form of candy. Per capita annual consumption of pure chocolate (minus peanuts, caramels, cherry cordials, etc.) is about three pounds.", "snippet": "FEW people would need more than one guess to pick America's favorite candy - it's chocolate, of course.
