The discovery concerns an enzyme that breaks down dopamine, a pleasure-enhancing chemical in the brain. Using a technique for imaging the living brain, reseachers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, L.I., have found that the enzyme is 40 percent less active in smokers, suggesting that dopamine levels would presumably be somewhat higher.", "snippet": "Discovery of an important biochemical difference in the brains of smokers suggests a new way, independent of nicotine, in which smoking may become addictive.
