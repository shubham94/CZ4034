In addition, she has hormone deficiencies and chronic heart failure. Her life expectancy today is only about two more years and she is too intelligent to have many illusions about the future. This grim portrait illustrates the human side of a frontier of medical research called ''gene therapy.'' Despite their variety, the young woman's life-threatening disabilities seem to result from a single defective or missing gene among the many thousands that make up any person's hereditary endowment. The result of that single gene defect is a grave form of anemia - beta zero thalassemia major.", "headline": {"main": "PATIENTS WAIT, BUT IS KNOWLEDGE RIPE FOR HUMAN GENE THERAPY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "20", "word_count": 1029, "_id": "4fd123198eb7c8105d5e6a63", "snippet": "The 21-year-old woman has ''gargoyle'' features, short stature and multiple bone deformities that have led to several fractures.
