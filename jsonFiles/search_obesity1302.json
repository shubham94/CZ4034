Although the usual image of camp is that of a horde of healthy children enjoying a wide range of supervised activities, camp is not just for the able-bodied. Throughout the country this summer, thousands of children with health problems such as cancer, diabetes, asthma, vision and hearing defects, hemophilia, obesity, crippled or missing limbs and mental retardation will be riding horses, swimming, camping out, canoeing, making handicrafts, studying nature and pursuing other activities associated with summer camp. For some handicapped or chronically ill children, this will be their first time away from home (except perhaps for a hospital stay) since the onset of their illness. For these children, it will also be their first chance to enjoy activities usually reserved for the hale and hearty, but in a setting in which they don't have to try keeping up with normal children. It may also be the first chance in years for their parents to enjoy a vacation alone. The camp experience, physicians have found, often breaks the vicious cycle of a family caught up in a child's illness.", "snippet": "THERE may still be snow on the ground in some parts of the country, but now is the time for children and their parents to start thinking seriously about summer camp.

They say that ''Americans don't need to be told to lose weight'' and present no evidence to substantiate this statement. The concept that height and weight make a murky standard is not valid, even if one were to give up the use of frame differentiation. The height- weight standards confuse people when they are used as esthetic standards, or as body-image concepts of masculinity and femininity. However, they are not confusing when they relate to life expectancy.", "snippet": "To the Editor:     It was amazing to learn that William Bennett and Joel Gurin, the authors of ''The Dieter's Dilemma: Eating Less and Weighing More,'' appear to be against the dissemination of health information (''A Matter of Fat,'' Op-Ed, March...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "GURIN, JOEL", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "BENNETT, WILLIAM", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "GLENN, MORTON B", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "STANDARDS AND STANDARDIZATION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "DIETING", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "26", "type_of_material": "Letter", "word_count": 496, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
