They could not face having another. The disease It causes digestive problems, breathing problems, lung infections, with an almost continual threat of death from early childhood onward. The woman ended her next pregnancy by abortion. But now she is pregnant again and plans to have this baby. Genetic testing that has become available only within the last several months has given her solid assurance that the child will be free of the disease. This is the human side of a revolution in diagnosis of genetic diseases that is unfolding today because of scientists' growing ability to find and interpret the messages of the human genes. Today such diagnoses are becoming available for an ever increasing roster of disorders caused by a fault in one or another single gene among the 50,000 to 100,000 that humans possess. Individually, most of these diseases are quite rare, although cystic fibrosis afflicts an estimated 30,000 Americans and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy appears about once in every 5,000 males born alive.", "snippet": "THE couple already had two children afflicted with the grim reality of cystic fibrosis.
