The study recommended the ''professionalization'' of caseworkers who deal with troubled families, as well as extensive changes in the ways that health-care and child-protection agencies recognize and respond to cases of abuse and neglect. Mayor Koch and some other city officials did not dispute the findings and said many of the recommendations were being put into effect. Other city officials, however, disputed the study's methods and findings, and the head of the mayoral task force that commissioned the study disavowed it yesterday, complaining about its methods and what he said was the premature release of the draft report. Although the study's data date from 1980, city officials acknowledged yesterday that confirmed cases of child abuse and neglect in the city had soared 140 percent in the last decade to more than 20,000 children in 1982. Of those, they said, 112 died of parental abuse or neglect.", "headline": {"main": "CHILD-ABUSE STUDY IS CRITICAL OF CITY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1864, "_id": "4fd13ce78eb7c8105d61330e", "snippet": "A two-year study of violent and suspicious childhood deaths suggests that two to three children under 6 years of age are dying each week in New York City as a result of parental abuse or chronic neglect and the failure of private and city agencies to...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/23/nyregion/child-abuse-study-is-critical-of-city.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "FONTANA, VINCENT J"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REFORM AND REORGANIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHILD ABUSE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By ROBERT D.
