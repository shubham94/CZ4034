''You know,'' says Art Herrera, who still cannot recall the moment without tears, ''it was the first time we held our son when he wasn't hooked up with wires and tubes to some machine.'' For the next 15 minutes, Mr. Herrera and his wife, Jan, sat with the body of their 11-week-old son, alone in a special room alongside the busy neonatal intensive care unit at Denver's Children's Hospital. ''When I think back on that day, even now I don't remember the ugly parts as much as I do that special time we had alone with Adam,'' said Mrs. Herrera, who, like her husband, is a schoolteacher in northern Colorado.

The study, by the State Commission on the Quality of Care for the Mentally Disabled, found that hospitals in the state often require, through written agreement or tradition, that psychiatric institutions provide either a therapy aide or registered nurse during hospital stays for their residents. This rule, the study says, costs the state $1.2 million a year, or the equivalent of the annual salary of 93 therapy aides, as well as overtime costs and disruptions at the mental hospitals.
