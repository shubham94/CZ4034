Now a research team from the National Institute on Aging and the University of Iowa has found in a three-year study of more than 8,200 people 68 and older that regular moderate activity like walking or gardening can reduce the risk of severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The research team, headed by Dr. Marco Pahor, who has since gone back to Rome, reported that those who took frequent walks were half as likely to develop this often-fatal condition as were inactive people of the same age. They suggested that exercise prevented hemorrhage by improving the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the gastrointestinal tract. This, in turn, can reduce the risk of bleeding caused by insufficient oxygen under a variety of circumstances, including the body's usual reaction to stress. Furthermore, by stimulating bowel function, exercise may reduce a person's chances of developing several intestinal disorders, including ulcers and diverticulosis, all of which increase the risk of hemorrhage.", "snippet": "THE potential benefits of regular physical exercise for older people continue to mount: reduced risk of heart attack, high blood pressure, arthritic pain, fractures from falls, among others.
