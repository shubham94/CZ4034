The Democrats have also embraced a bipartisan bill now pending in the Senate that would make it easier for workers who lose their jobs to buy health coverage. That is of critical importance in this era of downsizing and job shifts. House Republicans have embraced these provisions but have added to their bill amendments that are not only bad health policy but could delay passage of any useful health-care reform this year. The Senate bill, written by Nancy Kassebaum and Ted Kennedy, would require insurance companies to sell policies to workers who leave their jobs but have been continuously covered by their employers. The bill would also limit the length of time that insurers could refuse to cover an applicant's pre-existing medical problem and forbid insurers to drop chronically ill enrollees.", "headline": {"main": "Sensible Health Reform, for Now"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "24", "word_count": 529, "_id": "4fd1c7778eb7c8105d6f8d8f", "snippet": "The House is expected to vote today on two versions of health-care reform --  a sensible if limited Democratic bill and a harmful Republican version.
