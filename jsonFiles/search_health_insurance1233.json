The famous quote by the former N.F.L. commissioner Bert Bell - ''On any given Sunday, any team in the N.F.L. can beat any other'' - has been a source of reassurance for both fans and television programmers for decades. The league's carefully maintained competitive balance almost guarantees that every week will feature several compelling games between high-quality, evenly matched opponents. Almost. Bell would never imagine a week like this, in which the best (the Patriots) and most fascinating (the Eagles, the 49ers) teams have byes, while the top contenders face pushovers and the mediocre slug it out with the middling. Matchups that looked good when the schedule was announced now merit double-digit point spreads. Case in point: the Colts vs. the Saints, a rematch of Super Bowl XLIV that promised to be a seesaw offensive battle, is now little more than a three-hour wake for Indianapolis and a chance to watch Sean Payton coach New Orleans from the booth instead of the sideline. Granted, Curtis Painter, like a frozen burrito under a filling station heat lamp, is slowly warming to the Colts' starting quarterback job. His completion percentage has gone up every week, and the Colts offense no longer looks like an intramural team playing in a downpour. Also, Drew Brees offered hope that Payton might find a way to stand on, or slightly above, the field on the surgically repaired leg he broke in last week's game. ''I'm envisioning some kind of hovercraft on the sideline,'' Brees said. Levitating coaches: another thing that Bert Bell could never imagine. Pick: Saints. Bears (3-3) at Buccaneers (4-2) in London Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Bears by 1. The Buccaneers rookie defender Adrian Clayborn tried fish and chips for the first time as soon as Tampa Bay arrived in London on Monday. ''It didn't sit well with me at all,'' Clayborn told The Tampa Tribune. ''It messed up my stomach bad.'' Do not let Clayborn anywhere near steak and kidney pie. You would think that most Americans have encountered fish and chips by now, and conversely, that most Britons would be able to differentiate a football team worthy of international acclaim from, say, the Bears. However, Lovie Smith (whose Bears stayed in the United States until Thursday) expects something close to a home-field advantage. ''I'm told we have a big following overseas,'' Smith said, not realizing that many Londoners are still expecting to see William (The Refrigerator) Perry. Smith does not expect his Bears to be jet-lagged, any more than Raheem Morris expects his players to be cramped up from too much bangers and mash. Smith also hopes to win some new fans. ''I know the guys are excited about showing our brand of football over there,'' he said. The Bears brand includes Jay Cutler's occasionally uttering profanities, heard by a microphone, about the coordinator Mike Martz. Though if you really want to hear Cutler swear, get him to try bubble and squeak. Pick: Buccaneers.", "headline": {"main": "Looking for Exciting Matchups?
