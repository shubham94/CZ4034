The alcoholic: a red-nosed individual who drowns his troubles in drink and is usually found in a bar or on Skid Row. So goes the mythology that has long kept alcohol addiction, an affliction that alters the lives of 70 million Americans, in the Dark Ages. The fear of heart attack and cancer now sends people scurrying to doctors' offices for early detection, but few are willing to have this other leading killer diagnosed at any stage. Perhaps no other disease is so universally colored by social stigma that physicians tend to turn their backs on its manifestations and victims deny its existence, even to themselves.", "headline": {"main": "A NEW ATTACK ON ALCOHOLISM"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "47", "word_count": 5854, "_id": "4fd164778eb7c8105d6511fc", "snippet": "ALCOHOLISM: A mysterious and incurable result of a personality disorder; at worst, a moral disease; at best, a pyschological one.

According to doctors' estimates, 30 percent of AIDS patients also show symptoms of brain disease or damage to the spinal cord. Some of these patients show clear signs of dementia, including memory loss, inability to plan or make decisions, and a remarkable indifference to everything. Others develop partial paralysis, loss of muscle coordination or even worse problems in control of their bodies. These cases have often been puzzling. The virus that causes AIDS has been thought to be remarkably specific in its onslaught, attacking key immune defense cells called T-4 lymphocytes. While this attack cripples the entire immunological system, there has been no reason to think the destruction of these specialized cells causes damage to the brain.", "headline": {"main": "GRIM NEW RAVAGE OF AIDS: BRAIN DAMAGE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1843, "_id": "4fd152948eb7c8105d6350a7", "snippet": "EVIDENCE is mounting rapidly of a grim new dimension to acquired immune deficiency syndrome: The fatal disease can devastate the victims' brains as well as their immune defense systems.
