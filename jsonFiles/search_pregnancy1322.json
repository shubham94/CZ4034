By the 19th century and well into the 20th, the capital city, Havana, with its thick sea walls and rococo facades, was a cosmopolitan magnet for businessmen, artists and tourists alike. Its casinos were lavish; its night life was tireless. It was where you went to be extravagant, liberated and bad. Even the moralizing political liberation of the 1950's and 60's had its glamour. The revolutionary troops, with their scruffy-chic beards and berets, were popular international heroes for a time. And they were led by two genuine superstars: the baby-faced Fidel Castro and the Byronic Che Guevara. When their pictures appeared in the news, readers alternately flinched and swooned. With global capitalism triumphant, yet another fantasy is on the horizon: the revival of the island as the vacation spot it once was, a semitropical dream come true.", "headline": {"main": "Stylists Of the Epic And the Surreal", "kicker": "PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW"}, "abstract": "Holland Cotter reviews photographs of Cuba in its revolutionary and post-revolutionary phases, at Grey Art Gallery and Cuban Art Space; photos (M)", "print_page": "29", "word_count": 1683, "_id": "4fd229238eb7c8105d7b265c", "snippet": "CUBA, shaped like a scythe, lies in the Caribbean 90 miles off Florida.
