South Korea was outraged, because of the safety risks and because it wants to avoid inheriting liability for the waste in the event of North Korea's collapse. A1 Sotheby Executives Accused Sotheby's, the world's oldest and best known auction house, suspended several senior executives amid charges that they readily offered their services to smuggle a protected work of art out of Italy. Sotheby's denied that such abuses were systematic and said the journalism used in the investigation constituted entrapment. A9 Ecuador Chief Loses a Vote Ecuador's Congress voted to remove President Abdala Bucaram for ''mental incapacity.'' Lawmakers said they were exasperated by his six months in office, during which the President sang and pulled political stunts while Ecuador fell into economic crisis. Mr. Bucaram, a showman who cheerfully referred to himself as ''El Loco,'' called the vote a ''coup by Congress'' and said he would not recognize it. A5 Riots in South Africa Mixed-race South Africans, known as coloreds under apartheid laws, held a violent protest in Johannesburg. It erupted as part of a demonstration against local utility rates they said were higher than those in nearby black areas of Soweto. But it also reflected fears of many mixed-race people that they are being left out of the new South Africa. A15 Gore Meets Chernomyrdin Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin of Russia said that a summit meeting between Presidents Clinton and Boris Yeltsin would be held in late March, as scheduled. Mr. Chernomyrdin was in Washington for two days of talks with Vice President Al Gore. Progress on crucial matters between the two countries, like the question of NATO enlargement and other security issues, has been immobilized for the last six months by Mr. Yeltsin's illness. A19 No Progress in Peru Crisis Two hours of negotiations between leftist rebels in Peru and a commission chosen to represent the Government produced little if any progress towards the release of 72 hostages held inside the Japanese Ambassador's residence for more than seven weeks. The rebels denied that they were willing to discuss safe passage to a third country and sought to disparage a recent diplomatic tour by President Alberto Fujimori. A7 Opposition Struggles in Serbia Although President Slobodan Milosevic has recommended the restoration of opposition victories in 14 of Serbia's largest cities, the opposition may have a tough time governing: departing officials of Mr. Milosevic's Socialist party have left municipal coffers bare and are organizing resistance to the new administrations. A13 NATIONAL A20-27 Clinton Offers a Budget Intended to Reach Balance President Clinton introduced a $1.69 trillion spending plan for 1998 as a step to producing a balanced budget by 2002. He called it ''the best chance in a generation'' to balance the budget. A1 The Clinton budget has the glow of newness on it, but already the White House is working on elements of a compromise with Republicans, most likely including some sort of cut in the capital gains tax. A1 President Clinton asked Congress to provide health care for half of the 10 million children without health insurance. A25 The budget seeks $21 billion over five years to restore benefits to legal immigrants, reverse cuts in the food stamp program and create jobs for welfare recipients. A25 Simpson Suit Focuses on Money The families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman urged the jury weighing punitive damages against O. J. Simpson to make an example of him. Lawyers for Mr. Simpson said he was already $850,000 in debt and had no hidden assets to draw on. He has already been assessed $8.5 million in compensatory damages for Mr. Goldman's death. A20 Discard Cynicism, Clinton Says Telling the annual National Prayer Breakfast that politicians needed to rid themselves of ''this toxic atmosphere of cynicism,'' President Clinton invoked self-criticism and called for a moratorium on the politics of blame to concentrate more on working together. A26 Transportation Chief Confirmed The man who headed the Arkansas Highway Commission under Gov. Bill Clinton, Rodney Slater, was confirmed as Transportation Secretary under President Clinton. Mr. Slater is the fifth of Mr. Clinton's nominees to receive Senate confirmation. A22 Arrest in Clinic Attacks A 15-year-old in a Tulsa suburb was arrested by Federal agents on charges that he bombed and shot up an abortion clinic. A27 Youth Catches S.A.T. Error Colin Rizzio, a 17-year-old from Peterborough, N.H., encountered trouble on a question on the S.A.T. math test. The question had already been reviewed by a dozen people, and the College Board did not initially agree with his assertion that the officially approved answer was wrong. But after his E-mail inquiry and some review, the board is now sheepishly conceding that he was right -- and adding up to 30 points to the scores of some 45,000 of the students who took that test. A1 Dog May Get a Pardon Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and the state's Executive Council asked the town of Portsmouth to pardon a 3-year-old Labrador retriever, Prince, who faces execution for killing a rooster. A hearing is scheduled, and the City Attorney has said he wants to settle out of court. (Reuters) NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Passenger Jet Is Forced To Evade 2 Fighters A Boeing 727 passenger jet bound for Kennedy International Airport had to take sudden evasive actions after one or two F-16 fighter jets from the New Jersey Air National Guard repeatedly converged on it. Two flight attendants and a passenger were thrown to the 727's floor. A1 Police Union Investigated A Federal grand jury has subpoenaed 10 years of financial records from New York City's 29,000-member police union. The subpoena came two weeks after officials and lawyers of the smaller transit police union were indicted on racketeering charges. It is the first public indication that the investigation is now focusing on the politically potent Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. A1 More Environmental Spending The Pataki administration said it would speed up its plans to spend money from a bond act for environmental projects. In his budget last month, the Governor projected spending only about $500 million over five years from the bond act, far less than the $900 million he had suggested as he campaigned for it last fall. B1 No to Desegregation Plan The Whitman administration refused to order desegregation of a predominately black and Hispanic high school in Englewood, N.J. Officials said any plan to merge Englewood with the largely white school districts of surrounding Bergen County towns would increase the school's racial imbalance. B4 Airport Expansion Approved The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey approved spending $93 million to extend one of the runways at Newark International Airport. The project is expected to help curtail delays of up to 90 minutes at the airport, and will also allow Newark to accommodate larger, nonstop flights to the Far East and the farthest South American cities. B7 SPORTS B9-16 WEEKEND C1-33 BUSINESS DAY D1-17 America Online to Expand America Online Inc. said it would add 50,000 more modems to its on-line service by April, increasing its daily capacity by 60 percent, two months ahead of its previously announced timetable.
