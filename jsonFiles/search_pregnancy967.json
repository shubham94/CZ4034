[C1.] BACK TO MORGAN -- Morgan Stanley said that it had secured the return of Jon A. Anda, a senior investment banker, a small coup for a firm that has worked hard to replenish its pool of investment banking talent. [C1.] L-3 CHIEF EXECUTIVE DIES -- Frank C. Lanza, chief executive of L-3 Communications, one of the nation's largest military contractors, died at age 74 while recovering from surgery, setting off speculation over the future of the company that he helped found nearly a decade ago.
