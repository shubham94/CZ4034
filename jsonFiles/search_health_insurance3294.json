Carl McCall, has found. The audit also found that 27 percent of youths with special needs had not been evaluated, as required, when they entered the state juvenile justice system. The audit was based on a survey of 100 youths. A spokesman for the state's Office of Children and Family Services, Bill Van Slyke, said the study's methodology was flawed, and he called the report politically motivated. Somini Sengupta (NYT) BRONX: EX-TEACHER SAID TO ADMIT ABUSE -- A former teacher at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in the Bronx recently admitted to engaging in numerous sexual encounters with a student but cannot be prosecuted because the statute of limitations has expired, Edward F. Stancik, above, the special commissioner of investigation for the city's schools, said yesterday. Mr. Stancik recommended dismissing the former teacher, now assigned to administrative duties at a Bronx high school. The incidents, which occurred from 1981 to 1984, came to light last year when the former student, now 34, told the police about them. Mr. Stancik said the man later admitted the encounters to Mr. Stancik's investigators.
