Deutsche Telekom named Ren\u00e9 Obermann, above, to replace Kai-Uwe Ricke, who submitted his resignation Sunday after losing the confidence of big shareholders. [Page C1.] INTERNET VIA SATELLITE -- Companies like WildBlue and Hughes Network Systems, which provide Internet service via satellite, are filling one of the biggest gaps in the country's digital infrastructure. Roughly 15 million households cannot get broadband from their phone or cable provider because the companies have been slow to expand their high-speed networks in areas where there are not enough customers to generate an adequate profit. [C1.] BIG PAYDAY AT GOLDMAN -- Traders at Wall Street investment banks are priming themselves for another big bonus haul this year. And Raanan A. Agus, manager of one of Goldman Sachs' largest internal hedge funds will be in line for one of the firm's richer paydays. He is evidence that the real money on Wall Street is being made not by investment bankers cutting high-profile deals, but by anonymous traders making risky, bets with their firm's capital. [C1.] VALUE OF METS DEAL -- Experts in the realms of sports marketing, corporate identity and brand building offered sharply divergent views of the value of the huge deal that will name the new ballpark of the New York Mets for Citigroup. Under the deal, the new Mets stadium, scheduled to open in spring 2009, will be called Citi Field. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C5.] IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE -- The Mets stadium deal could have been worse. The new ballpark could have been named for some company overcharging in Iraq or a scandalized corporation or a geeky-sounding electronics firm that may or may not still exist when the gates open in 2009. Sports of the Times: George Vecsey [D1.] READY FOR BOARDING -- Airlines have been boarding passengers for decades, long enough, it would seem, to have figured out the best way to get people on and off a plane. But they haven't. Spurred by financial pressures and packed planes, airlines have come up with a wide variation of boarding techniques, from the simple back-to-front protocol to much more complicated strategies. The goal is to get planes back in the air faster. [C1.] BATTLE OVER HEALTH PLAN -- A legal battle over a plan to offer free or low-cost health care to all uninsured residents in San Francisco has been set in motion by a group of the city's most important and beloved constituents: restaurants. A culinary trade group with more than 800 members has sued the city, saying a central provision in the program violates federal employment law. [A14.] FEDERAL HEALTH PLAN -- The health insurance industry has proposed an expansion of Medicaid and new tax breaks with the goal of guaranteeing coverage for all children in three years and for virtually all adults within 10 years. New members of Congress, especially those elected on a pledge to help the uninsured, are likely to embrace many of the proposals, which provide a benchmark for debate on the issue. [A14.] MEN'S HEALTH -- In recent years, women's health has been a national priority. Pink ribbons warn of breast cancer. Pins shaped like red dresses raise awareness about heart disease. Yet statistics show that men are more likely than women to suffer an early death. Now some scientists are beginning to ask a question that in some circles might be considered politically incorrect: Is men's health getting short shrift? [F1.] VIETNAM TRADE VOTE -- Legislation to normalize trade relations with Vietnam was defeated in the House, four days before President Bush makes his first visit to the country. The measure failed to win the necessary two-thirds majority it needed to pass under a procedure adopted in an effort to rush it through with limited debate. The measure will be voted on again, possibly as early as today, under normal procedures which will require only a majority for passage. [C1.] MICROSOFT ALLIANCE -- Microsoft plans to unveil a technology industry alliance today to make software from competing companies and partners work better together. The move is latest effort by Microsoft to move from being a company that insists on the advantages of its own products to one that can adapt when customers use other companies' goods. The alliance will be announced in Barcelona, Spain, at an event for European software developers. [C3.] NEW TIVO FEATURES -- TiVo plans to introduce features that will allow people to use its digital video recorders to watch some video programming from the Internet on their televisions. Until now, TiVo has not been able to tap into the explosion of Web video Internet. The new features, to be announced today, are designed to change that. [C3.] LOSSES AT MEAT PROCESSOR -- Tyson Foods, the world's biggest meat processor, reported its third straight quarterly loss because of lower chicken and beef prices. Tyson said it would return to profit in 2007 and its stock price posted the biggest one-day gain since July. [C11.] HEDGE FUND SCRUTINY -- The Securities and Exchange Commission expects to file more lawsuits aimed at hedge funds accused of illegal trading and violating their clients' trust, the agency's chief enforcer said.
