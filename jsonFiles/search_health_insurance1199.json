In his debut debate, his first introduction to a national audience, he found himself first explaining and then doubling down on his description of\u00a0 Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme,\" with a few references to the \"monstrous lie\" of its long-term promises thrown in for good measure. It was precisely the kind of moment that the Romney campaign must have been hoping for, and thanks to the moderators' questions and Perry's answers, it fell into Romney's lap without him having to even raise the issue. As soon as the exchange happened, a Romney adviser e-mailed Politico's Ben Smith: \"[Perry] has lost. No federal candidate has ever won on the Perry program to kill Social Security. Never has. never will.\" That's spin, yes, but I'm sure the Romney people believe the basic premise. As well they should. Everything we know about American voters - and yes, Republican primary voters very much included - suggests that Perry's comments will eventually be deadly to his electoral prospects.", "headline": {"main": "The Rick Perry Experiment", "kicker": "Ross Douthat"}, "abstract": "He's running as exactly the kind of candidate that a lot of conservatives claim the country wants.", "print_page": null, "word_count": 559, "_id": "4fd3a11d8eb7c8105d8e75fa", "snippet": "He's running as exactly the kind of candidate that a lot of conservatives claim the country wants.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/the-rick-perry-experiment/", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Ross", "lastname": "DOUTHAT"}], "original": "By ROSS DOUTHAT"}, "document_type": "blogpost", "pub_date": "2011-09-08T10:17:29Z", "section_name": "Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "Interactive Feature", "blog": [], "news_desk": "U.S. / 9/11 Anniversary", "lead_paragraph": "Al Qaeda spent roughly half a million dollars to destroy the World Trade Center and cripple the Pentagon.
