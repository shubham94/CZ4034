''I have no editor,'' the 30-year-old writer says. ''I can say whatever I want.'' But his on-line gossip sheet, the Drudge Report, is rapidly becoming a must-read for the political and entertainment elites on both coasts. -- Newsweek THE GRUDGE REPORT Good morning, shameless gossip addicts and on-line character assassins! Rather than ruin my entire weekend waiting for actual tattles and tidbits from Barbra Streisand's nuptials to muddy my modem, I transmit this detailed report of the wedding -- before it even happened! Remember, you heard it here first. BARBRA-PALOOZA'S MOSH PIT THE GRUDGE REPORT has learned the names of the lucky few who sat on the dais with the bride and groom. Those honored include: President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her date, Senator Jesse Helms; Robert Kuttner, economics columnist; Stephen B. Hawking, physicist; Donna Karan, designer and gal pal; Prof. Anita Hill, and a furloughed Susan McDougal wearing either too-much jewelry or very tasteful manacles. The presence of the Republican Senator from North Carolina kept the politically correct audience on edge all day. The day's most tense moment came during the wedding vows when the room was asked: ''If any one person wishes to hold up this entire wedding with a petty, personal objection, let him speak now or forever hold his peace.'' Capitol Hill sources tell the GRUDGE REPORT that a subpoena will be issued to a wedding guest, the novelist Joyce Carol Oates, to answer allegations that President Clinton placed his hands on hers during a festive line dance immediately following dessert. THE GRUDGE REPORT has learned the wedding was originally scheduled for the weekend of July 12 on Long Beach Island, N.J. But it was delayed until Mr. Brolin agreed to a prenuptial agreement that gave Ms. Streisand a line-item veto and the authority to subject him to means-tested Social Security benefits beginning in 2005. Other sources close to Ms. Streisand said she was too involved in the recent budget negotiations to concentrate on wedding arrangements at that time. SEEN & HEARD . . . All nine of the Baldwin brothers were on hand, including the previously unknown Zeppo. Their attendance was conditional on a promise to be ''poster boys for good behavior.'' . . . The groom's agent at I.C.M. is confident his client can now demand double scale for all future Aamco commercials. WOMEN IN BROWN At the last minute, Donna Karan outfitted the bridal party in gowns of chocolate brown in an expression of solidarity with striking United Parcel Service employees. Her decision to wear only a single spaghetti strap across the left shoulder symbolized the insufficient support provided by part-time work schedules. Other guests, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Feldman and Goldie Hawn were seen sporting brown ribbons and digital tracking codes. ONE ENCHANTED SEMINAR Sources reveal that Ms. Streisand and Mr. Brolin met for the first time in 1994 at a Hollywood Political Action Committee panel discussion of the Clinton Health Care Proposal. Ms. Streisand was there to testify about the economies of scale that might be achieved under managed cooperative insurance groups while Mr. Brolin reprised his role from the popular television series ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'' to offer insights from the medical community. The chemistry between the two was obvious when Mr. Brolin announced, under oath, ''Well, you look plenty healthy to me.'' BRIDE COVERS THE ANGLES The GRUDGE REPORT has learned that in addition to serving as musical arranger, choreographer, floral arranger and chief of protocol, the multi-talented Streisand also served as the wedding's director. Guests report that the entire right half of the chapel was cordoned off so photographs of the bride could only be taken from the left side, which she prefers. However, the seating arrangement embarrassed the groom's family members, because it appeared as if they did not attend. Guests on the left side complained of the room's diffused lighting and a hazy, eclipsed view of the couple created by excessive use of gauze around the huppah. AWKWARD MOMENTS . . . Secret Service agents were visibly confused when the Marine Corps Band struck up ''Hail to the Chief,'' after the President was already seated. No one informed them it was also the wedding's bridal march. Mr. and Mrs. Clinton later exited the room to the theme to ''Hello, Dolly!'' . . . A momentary scuffle ensued when Ms. Streisand yelled at her own photographer for hounding her relentlessly throughout the wedding. Ms. Streisand's manager later agreed to pay for the damage to Ms. Leibowitz's camera.
