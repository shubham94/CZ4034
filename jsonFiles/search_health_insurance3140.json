With much back-slapping, the State Senate passed a good bill this week on women's health care that it had been stonewalling for years. This has everything to do with next Tuesday's special State Senate election on Manhattan's East Side, in which the Democratic candidate, Liz Krueger, has made the Senate's intransigence an issue. The Republican Senate majority, which is desperate to maintain its hold on that seat, suddenly dropped its longstanding opposition to the bill. But now the Democratic majority in the Assembly, with an eye on the same election, is trying to stall action. They should stop playing games and give it final passage. The bill, which has drawn intense criticism from the Catholic Church, requires companies to include coverage of birth control in their insurance plans. The Senate added a ''conscience clause'' permitting an exemption for situations in which a majority of those working or being served by an institution share the employer's religious beliefs, like churches themselves, or parochial schools. But the majority leader, Joseph Bruno, dropped his insistence that the bill also exempt religious institutions like hospitals and social service organizations that get public funds and employ people of all different faiths. The language adopted by the Senate is a good compromise, taken from a law that has already weathered the courts in California. The opportunity to pass a women's health bill may not last long, particularly if the Republicans lose the Senate race next week, which pits Ms. Krueger against the Republican Assemblyman John Ravitz. But the Assembly, probably hoping to keep Ms. Krueger's issue alive, has become the roadblock, insisting that the bill also include language eliminating insurance co-payment requirements for mammograms and pap smears.
