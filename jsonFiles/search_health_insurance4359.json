As one little girl approached another children's museum, her mother wasn't sure whether her reaction would be boundless enthusiasm or I've-seen-it-all ennui. The first good sign was that she began running as soon as she entered the new Hudson Valley Children's Museum. The second was that she promptly disappeared. And in this most frenzied of seasons, there is much to be said for a public place where you can safely lose a 7-year-old. The museum formally opens Phase I of its space tomorrow. (Phase II is scheduled for 1997.) Situated in Nyack, N.Y., a picturesque town probably best known as the birthplace of the artist Edward Hopper, the museum stands on a gently sloping street where signs advertise live bait and homemade pie (not together, of course). The museum isn't nearly as pretty as the harbor nearby: it occupies 5,000 square feet of warehouse space rented from the Nyack Seaport Corporation. But inside, it offers opportunities for children to mingle, move and make noise while receiving an impromptu education in topics ranging from physics to geography.", "headline": {"main": "The Nurturing of Tiny Techies"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1973, "_id": "4fd1ecea8eb7c8105d73eae0", "snippet": "NEW YORK CITY children often become jaded even faster than their parents.
