He looked out at us from millions of television screens across the nation, a latter-day Lazarus, a man whose life had been forfeit. A few weeks ago, calmly sitting there in Salt Lake City in his blue pajamas and red dressing gown, Dr. Barney B. Clark talked easily if somewhat breathlessly for the video cameras. It seemed impossible that just three months earlier he had been rushed into an operating room in the evening, so near death that the surgery could not wait until the next morning. We have all been caught up in the drama. For the first time, an alien object made of metal and plastic has permanently taken the place of a failing heart. As of this writing, 15 weeks after the operation, the courageous patient has fought his way past one setback after another. The two men most intimately responsible for the achievement -Dr. William C. DeVries, the surgeon, and Dr. Robert K. Jarvik, the designer of the artificial heart -have become national figures.", "headline": {"main": "TOWARD THE CONQUEST OF HEART DISEASE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "42", "word_count": 5694, "_id": "4fd1319d8eb7c8105d5ff73e", "snippet": "Harry Schwartz, writer-in-residence at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, is a former member of The New York Times's editorial board.

Pyle supports the Reagan Administration proposals to require working Americans to pay income tax on the health insurance premiums paid by their employers over and above a certain amount. Not collecting the tax, he said, ''encourages more expensive, full-coverage health insurance,'' and he believes that ''the distortions this tax break creates have contributed to waste and mismanagement in health care.'' We strongly support improved management of health care and reduction in the overutilization of health-care services. But the ''tax cap'' proposal, endorsed by Mr. Pyle, is a very clumsy way of accomplishing those objectives. We fear, too, that it may cost more in higher hospital utilization and administrative costs than the Government will collect in increased revenues.", "headline": {"main": "COUNTERPRODUCTIVE 'TAX CAP' ON HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": 457, "_id": "4fd12a1d8eb7c8105d5f2321", "snippet": "To the Editor:    In an Op-Ed article published Feb. 28, Thomas O.

But it seems to help and they probably suffer no ill effects. Peruvian Indians have been using it for generations. ''At the other end of the spectrum,'' said Dr. Robert Byck of Yale University, an expert on cocaine, ''is a man I encountered who was spending $400,000 a year, buying cocaine by the half pound, and shooting it intravenously. He was sitting in a blacked-out cellar with an M-1 rifle, shooting at his hallucinations.'' The man in the basement and the hotel guests in Cuzco were taking the same drug. The two uses point up the dramatic difference in reactions to which many Americans are now subjecting themselves. Use of illicit drugs is continuing to rise among American adults, and social scientists believe that to a large extent this usage has become increasingly ''acceptable'' on all levels of American society. To medical experts, such acceptance represents dangerous ignorance. ''The selection in the delicatessen of drugs is much greater than its ever been,'' says Dr. M. Duncan Stantan of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Some of these natural or artificially produced chemicals are new or recently produced variants of older forms that are better understood than the new ones.", "headline": {"main": "DRUG ABUSE IN AMERICA: WIDENING ARRAY BRINGS NEW PERILS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2009, "_id": "4fd12dcc8eb7c8105d5f9032", "snippet": "AMERICAN hotel guests in Cuzco, Peru, 12,000 feet high in the Andes, are sometimes surprised at being offered coca tea to help them adjust to the altitude.
