Currently, more than two-thirds of the cases are not diagnosed until the disease has spread beyond the site of origin, and only 15 to 25 percent of the victims ultimately survive it. However, clinical findings disclosed during the last decade or so indicate that ovarian cancer needn't be nearly so deadly if proper attention is paid to its early warning signs and if the best available therapies are routinely applied. As things now stand, early symptoms of ovarian cancer are usually ignored or dismissed as insignificant. Proper diagnosis is not made until the cancer is in a relatively advanced stage. There is some evidence that it may take as long as eight years for an ovarian cancer to reach this obvious phase of development, holding out the hope that one or more early detection tests now under study may significantly reduce the deadliness of this disease. As for treatment, often it is not as aggressive as it might be. So it is that each year thousands of women fail to get the therapies that offer the best chances for survival.", "snippet": "CANCER of the ovary, the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in American women, is a disease that is widely misunderstood and often mistreated.
