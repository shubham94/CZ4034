T. Barnum, there's a study born every minute, and there are countless suckers out there ready to believe anything they hear or read. Many people make significant changes in what they eat, drink, take or do based on research that is far from conclusive. Some become unduly alarmed about suspected but unproven risks to health, especially ones in the air, water or food supply, that they cannot control. Others decide that, because what is ''fact'' one week is sometimes contradicted by a new study finding the next, they won't change any habit until ''the scientists make up their minds.'' This kind of confusion is understandable given two facts of modern life. First, fed in part by media attention to health issues, the public's concern about health and demand for health information has increased significantly in recent decades. Second, few people, including many who report health findings in print or on the air, know how to interpret scientific research or understand the certainties -- and uncertainties -- inherent in different kinds of studies.", "snippet": "TO paraphrase P.
