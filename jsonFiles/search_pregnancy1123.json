The novel is Woolf's most autobiographical. (Transfixed by the portrait of their mother, her sister Vanessa wrote, ''It is almost painful to have her so raised from the dead.'') Set in the Hebrides, it is based on Woolf's recollections of idyllic childhood summers spent at St. Ives on the Cornish coast. Unlike the green light that winks at the end of the dock in F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby,'' the lighthouse that lends itself to the title of Woolf's novel is not merely a writerly conceit. It actually exists in the form of the Godrevy lighthouse, which you can see off in the distance from the end of the quay that runs along the pier at St. Ives. It was in search of a glimpse of this literary landmark that my 14-year-old daughter, Zoe, and I traveled early in July to the southwestern tip of England, where the country narrows down into a shape approximating a human foot.", "headline": {"main": "To The Lighthouse And Beyond"}, "abstract": "Daphne Merkin article on visit to Godrevy lighthouse, St Ives and St Mawes in Cornwall, Eng; lighthouse is one featured in Virginia Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse; photos; map (The Sophisticated Traveler, part 2 of 2-part section) (L)", "print_page": "48", "word_count": 2591, "_id": "4fd23cb38eb7c8105d7d2325", "snippet": "A summer visit to Cornwall, with its picturesque fishing villages and cozy pubs, is inspired by Virginia Woolf's lyrical novel.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/12/travel/sophisticated/12ST-CORNWALL.html", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2004/09/12/travel/sophisticated/12cornwall.75.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2004/09/12/travel/sophisticated/12cornwall.75.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "WOOLF, VIRGINIA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "CORNWALL (ENGLAND)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "GREAT BRITAIN"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "ST IVES (ENGLAND)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "ST MAWES (ENG)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GODREVY LIGHTHOUSE (ENG)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LIGHTHOUSES AND LIGHTSHIPS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SPECIAL SECTIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Daphne", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Merkin"}], "original": "By Daphne Merkin"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2004-09-12T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Travel; Magazine"}, {"type_of_material": "Review", "blog": [], "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "lead_paragraph": "A spinoff, a sequel and a knockoff.
