A fragmentary but growing body of evidence being collected by Government agencies, scientists and private industry indicates that indoor air pollution can often be as dangerous to health as polluted outdoor air -and sometimes more so. Legislation has been introduced in both the House and the Senate to provide money for a broad research program into the causes and cures of indoor pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency, which recently created a group to look into the subject, has completed a report on radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can cause lung cancer; it collects inside buildings. The report estimated that about a million homes are contaminated at dangerous levels and that between 5,000 and 20,000 Americans die each year because of lung cancer caused by the radioactive gas. Another recent study by the agency found that chemical solvents in homes were more of a health threat than those solvents in the air around the chemical plants that produced them.", "snippet": "Those warnings to remain indoors on smoggy summer days might not always be such great advice.
