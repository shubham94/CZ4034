Twelve miles or more beneath its surface, in hellish temperatures and under pressures 50,000 times that at sea level, the earth itself may be generating methane, say researchers who have squeezed common rock and water together to reproduce these conditions. The discovery bears on a longstanding argument about the source of petroleum and whether deposits are generated by rotting vegetation or by inorganic processes. ''If the answer turns out to be inorganic, this has huge implications for the ecology and economy of our planet as well as for the chemistry of other planets,'' said the physicist Dr. Freeman Dyson, of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, in a written comment, adding that the new work showed how to do experiments that will tackle the question.
