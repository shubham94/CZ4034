Shapiro. 272 pages. Random House, New York. $14.50. Mr. Shapiro, a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine, has written an unemotional, ordered book about an emotional, disordered problem -America's growing piles of nuclear waste - a problem whose solution continues to elude both the Government and the private sector. In concise fashion, he defines the major and minor sources of the problem, including 10.2 million cubic feet of high-level wastes, created mostly by Government reactors producing plutonium for weapons and, to a lesser extent, by medical and research reactors engaged in a variety of projects.", "headline": {"main": "SCIENCE LIBRARY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 921, "_id": "4fd117d68eb7c8105d5cf59e", "snippet": "Radwaste: A Reporter's Investigation of a Growing Nuclear Menace By Fred C.

Should they pick up the infant, and thus risk ''spoiling'' the child, or should they sometimes leave him alone and ignore his cries? In trying to answer that question, scientists are learning that infant crying is not simply a distress signal but a powerful communicator that helps determine whether any baby will become an abused or a cherished child. By crying and eliciting - or not eliciting - his parents' response, the infant begins to shape a concept of the environment and to develop patterns of either competence or helplessness that may persist lifelong, some researchers believe. Studies show that infants as young as 8 weeks of age appreciate their ability to make things happen through crying. Crying may also help them cope with the limitations of their immature nervous systems.", "headline": {"main": "BABY'S CRY, IT TURNS OUT, CAN SPEAK VOLUMES"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1455, "_id": "4fd11c2f8eb7c8105d5d8b6f", "snippet": "EACH generation of new parents painfully confronts the old dilemma that the crying baby presents.
