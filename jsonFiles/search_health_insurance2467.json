Mr. Landsburg invokes ''economic considerations'' to suggest that the answer is ''no.'' Many commentators have attacked his argument as morally preposterous. Well, yes.

But its outlook for the second quarter fell well below Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to fall as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading.

[C1.] J.P. Morgan Chase Says Quarterly Profit Rose 62% J.P. Morgan Chase said fourth-quarter profit increased 62 percent, but the strong performance was marred by concerns about the volatility of its businesses, especially trading. The company earned $2.7 billion, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $1.67 billion, or 46 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.

Sweeney, called on Congress to enact universal health insurance and to bar American companies from selling goods produced overseas under sweatshop conditions. Mr. Sweeney said the nation's unions would push in 30 states for legislation, like that enacted last week in Maryland, requiring large corporations to pay a specific percentage of their payroll toward health insurance.

Working for Google as a Sideline Feeling depressed because you missed out on Google's stock bonanza? Not to worry. Just get on the company's shadow payroll. Hundreds of thousands of people have essentially done just that by starting blogs, forums or other informational sites and getting paid for posting ads on Google's behalf. The trickle-down effect from Google does not stop at fledgling entrepreneurs. A growing number of rank-and-file contributors to Web sites, including Shawn Hogan, above, of Digital Point Solutions are also profiting. Bob Tedeschi, E-Commerce Report. C7. A Media Company in Shanghai Looks to the West It is more than 7,000 miles from New York to Shanghai, but the workings of media companies like Time Warner and NBC Universal loom large in the mind of Li Ruigang, who runs the Shanghai Media Group, a budding conglomerate with a striking number of tentacles in media and entertainment and a considerable thirst for partnerships with foreign media companies. The wide scope of its activities and the pace with which Mr. Li has sought out Western partners in less than four years have established him as a favored ally for companies trying to crack China's vast market. C1. Television Ads Find a Place in Cellphones Television-style advertising is coming to the mobile phone, part of a broader push by marketers to create a new generation of ''up close and personal'' ads by delivering video, audio, banner displays and text clips over a device carried by most American adults. Marketers said they were particularly excited about the prospect of eventually using cellphones, many of which have global positioning systems, to send ads to consumers based on their locations. C1. Icahn Struggles to Find a Board for Time Warner As a dissident shareholder, Carl C. Icahn has criticized the management and board of Time Warner and has vowed to start a proxy fight to replace the board. But Mr. Icahn reportedly is having trouble finding media executives to join the board, a claim that he disputes. C1. Over the years, Carl C. Icahn has made a fortune as a corporate raider who is perhaps best known for his battle to get RJR Nabisco to split itself into two. But Mr. Icahn's magic touch seems to have eluded him with Blockbuster, a company in which he and his fund have accumulated 17 million shares at an average price of about $8. On Friday, Blockbuster closed at $3.83. C3. Books by Chilean Author Will Be Made Into Movies Looking for the next blockbuster series on the model of ''The Lord of the Rings'' or the Harry Potter movies, Walden Media has bought the rights to a children's book trilogy by the Chilean author Isabel Allende. C4. Agreement Keeps Canadian Debate Off Comedy Networks Some Americans are still taken by the novelty of fake-news broadcasts like ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.'' In Canada, news parodies sometimes draw larger audiences than the real thing. But during the current Canadian federal election campaign, Canada's TV satirists have faced an issue that has never troubled ''The Daily Show.'' An agreement between Canada's main TV networks and its largest political parties bans the shows from using film from televised debates (although the clips are available to conventional news and current affairs shows). C4. Because of the spread of digital video recorders, the people who measure television audiences have had to expand the definition of ''live'' to mean ''anytime this week.'' Nielsen Media Research changed its ratings system to include data from digital video recorders. But the new system may pose a problem for Nielsen's clients. C4 Uncommon Promotions for Unusual Films The marketing of movies is about finding an audience. But what if an audience does not want to be found? This was the problem facing Sony Pictures Classics, which is distributing ''The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.'' Not surprisingly, one of this film's target audiences is Mexican immigrants -- both legal and illegal. Like many makers and distributors of independent films, Sony Classics had to do more than spend money to promote the film. It had to tap its ingenuity. Advertising. C5. A Wireless System That Believes in Sharing Two West Coast start-ups -- Mushroom Networks and WiBoost Inc. -- have built prototypes of simple wireless systems that make it possible for groups of neighbors to share their D.S.L. or cable Internet connections. Both companies said that sharing high-speed lines might enable users in small neighborhood clusters to download files and Web pages up to 10 times faster. C6.
