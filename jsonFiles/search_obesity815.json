Ah, wouldn't that be bliss! Like Thanksgiving in the United States, Christmas in Britain has grown into an inescapable culinary dinosaur from which you chicken out at your peril -- even in an era when a new, lighter British cuisine is being promoted by young chefs like Jamie Oliver. Families, the majority of which are better kept apart, are suddenly thrown together for a ritual feast lasting several days, plowing their way through a few million roast turkeys, mince pies and Christmas puddings and cakes, not to mention swimming the alcohol lake. I suppose if I had to raise a flag for Christmas food, by far the heaviest and most indigestible of the entire year, it would be because it is one of those moments when the British relive history. Each of those dishes that spell Christmas has an honorable pedigree. In the 1600's, Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary that he was given a turkey for Christmas on no less than four occasions and it was the task of the luckless Mrs. Pepys to kill the creature as the kitchen maid refused. It wasn't, I admit, necessarily eaten on the day but certainly during the festive period. Indeed if we turn to Parson Woodforde's diary a century later Christmas dinner was generally graced by a sirloin of roast beef as its centerpiece. And Woodforde lived in Norfolk, the county that produced the best turkeys, which were driven, poor things, all the way to London to be slaughtered.", "snippet": "''If I had my way  and I shan't,'' wrote that doyenne of British food writers, Elizabeth David, ''my Christmas Day eating and drinking would consist of an omelet and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich with a...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "GREAT BRITAIN", "name": "glocations"}, {"value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "CHRISTMAS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "FOOD", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "43", "type_of_material": "Op-Ed", "word_count": 1198, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}, {"news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "document_type": "article", "_id": "4fd235d78eb7c8105d7c79a1", "headline": {"main": "A Small-Scale Attack on Urban Despair"}, "pub_date": "2003-12-17T00:00:00Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "source": "The New York Times", "byline": {"original": "By SARA RIMER", "person": [{"lastname": "RIMER", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Sara", "organization": "", "role": "reported"}]}, "abstract": "Meg Campbell opened Codman Academy charter school three years ago in Boston (Mass) as center for predominantly poor and black children to experience educational advantages that students in upper-middle-class families experience; photos (M)", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/17/nyregion/a-small-scale-attack-on-urban-despair.html", "section_name": "Education; New York and Region", "lead_paragraph": "Meg Campbell has banned French fries and fast food from Codman Academy, the small charter high school she opened here three years ago.
