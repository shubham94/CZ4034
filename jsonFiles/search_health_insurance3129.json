What doctor wouldn't be eager to work with fewer patients and less hassle for the same or added income? But it seems a bit much for the physicians engaged in these ventures to depict their reach for a better life as motivated by solicitude for their patients or as a principled protest against the high-volume demands of managed care. The new ''boutique'' or ''concierge'' medical plans -- described in Tuesday's Times by Pam Belluck and in earlier articles in The Boston Globe -- typically offer a range of services beyond those covered by private insurance or Medicare. One medical practice that will open soon in Boston plans to charge patients $4,000 a year ($7,500 for families) on top of the medical costs covered by insurance. For that fee, the patients will get cellphone access to their doctors at any time, day or night; appointments on the same day they call; annual nutrition and physical fitness assessments in their homes or health clubs; home visits when necessary; and doctors to accompany them on visits to specialists. Each doctor will serve fewer patients -- 300 a year instead of thousands -- and thus will presumably deliver better service.", "headline": {"main": "Boutique Medicine"}, "abstract": "Editorial questions motivation behind handful of doctors nationwide, who are offering 'boutique' or 'concierge' medical plans for patients who can afford to pay thousands of dollars annually for highly personalized service (M)", "print_page": "28", "word_count": 574, "_id": "4fd212468eb7c8105d788263", "snippet": "It is easy to understand why a handful of doctors around the country are offering highly personalized medical care to patients who can afford to pay thousands of dollars a year for the added service.
