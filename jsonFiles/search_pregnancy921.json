Dressing for her growing girth has required resourcefulness and creativity, said Ms. Taylor, 40, who stars with Frank Langella and Lauren Ambrose in the film ''Starting Out in the Evening,'' in limited release starting Friday. ''Maternity is still a market that needs to be tapped,'' she said. ''I thought there'd be more out there. Instead, I've been wearing drawstring pants in larger sizes, going up into the 30s. Lucky Brand has turned out to be really good. They make a great jean called the Lil' Maggie.'' Ms. Taylor has discovered a few gems designed for pregnancy, too. Here, she wears a Cadeau maternity jacket with Habitual maternity jeans. Her shoes are by Christian Louboutin. ''What's nice about the jacket is that it's casual but it also pops, so you can go somewhere in the evening,'' she said. ''I've also been wearing short skirts and some little dresses. Anything bigger, and I feel like I'm being swallowed.''", "headline": {"main": "Maternity Jeans"}, "abstract": "Actress Lili Taylor, who is expecting her first baby, comments on her new look; photo (Pulse column) (S)", "print_page": "3", "word_count": 268, "_id": "4fd263f48eb7c8105d816c09", "snippet": "THE MOTHER-TO-BE The indie-movie actress Lili Taylor has a new production under way: she is expecting her first baby, a girl, in January.
