One day they hear that taking postmenopausal estrogen may cut their risk of Alzheimer's disease by more than 50 percent. The very next day, another study links the long-term use of postmenopausal hormones to a 50 percent decline in deaths from heart disease but also a 43 percent increase in breast-cancer deaths. Since breast cancer is the disease most feared by American women -- even though it is far from being the biggest cause of death among them -- it is easy to understand why most postmenopausal women are running scared.
