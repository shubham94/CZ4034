Instead, it will focus on promoting private and voluntary efforts to tackle problems like drugs, school safety and housing needs, as well as to encourage more civic responsibility on the part of the entertainment media. My own experience suggests that it will not be easy for this initiative to succeed. As a policy adviser in the Clinton White House, one part of my mission was to work with others to develop ways in which government could help revitalize America's civic life. It was a grand charge. And while we scored some programmatic successes -- like creating Americorps, which has given more than 100,000 young people a chance to serve their country while earning college scholarships -- I have to say that the broader effort to use the White House as a bully pulpit to energize a new ethic of citizenship did not succeed. The adverse cultural trends were too powerful to overcome, and sustaining presidential involvement proved difficult.
