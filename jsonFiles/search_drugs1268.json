Lack of treatment has a high cost, and we agree with the plea for more Federal support. You mention two pharmacologic agents, methadone and naltrexone, among treatments \"that effectively block heroin craving and permit addicts to live normal lives.\" Although both have helped many addicts, each has limitations. They are very different and work for different subgroups of patients. Buprenorphine is another product of the legitimate drug industry, pharmacologically intermediate between methadone and naltrexone. It seems to benefit yet another subgroup of heroin addicts.", "headline": {"main": "Case for Decriminalizing Drugs Dies in Zurich; Heroin Treatment"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "30", "word_count": 365, "_id": "4fd1b3648eb7c8105d6d70b8", "snippet": "To the Editor:   As \"The New Heroin Bargain\" (editorial, Feb. 10) describes, many addicted individuals are excluded from treatment programs because of insufficient funds for all those who need treatment.
