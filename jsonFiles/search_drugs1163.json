He was a member of the Connecticut Medicaid Cost Commission and president of the Connecticut Association of H.M.O.'s. He said that he believed in health care reform but that \"you don't want to do it just through caps, transferring responsibility to another sector of the economy.\" When he pondered who would pay for all the new patients and services proposed in the Administration's health package, he concluded that the private sector would be picking up a much greater share of what has been subsidized by the government in the past. \"There will be one big shifting of the responsibility, and I can't understand where they're getting all this money from,\" he said.", "headline": {"main": "Connecticut Q&A: Peter Aaronson; Assessing the Clinton Health Care Proposal"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": "1544", "_id": "4fd10bba8eb7c8105d5bf933", "snippet": "AS a health care consultant, Peter Aaronson has cast a steely eye at the Clinton health care plan.

They had stood in the ferry terminal passing out Vote Yes bumper stickers and Vote Yes wooden nickels. Vote Yes wooden nickels were practically the coin of the realm now, scattered from Tottenville to St. George, and only some pretentious, hairsplitting outsider -- somebody from the other side of the bridge or across the water, somebody off-island -- would bother asking why true believers devoted to a cause would promote it with symbols of counterfeit.

The secessionist politicians were led by State Senator John J.
