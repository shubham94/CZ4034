''He liked to threaten people, to keep them on edge. He transferred me from one city to another arbitrarily. When I wanted to know why, he said it was none of my business. ''One day he found the coffee machine had been left on overnight, and he hit the roof.'' said Ms. Marchaj. ''When his secretary came in, he started yelling, blaming her for things she hadn't done. I stood up for her. For weeks after that, he wouldn't speak to me. When I finally went to talk to him, he said, 'You've made my staff lose respect for me.' I told him I couldn't exist in that closed, lying environment, even though top management had assured me I would be promoted to his level in six months. I quit.'' The tale told by Ms. Marchaj, now a stress-management consultant at Northampton Wellness Associates in Northampton, Mass., is an old one: the unbearable boss who makes life miserable for subordinates.", "snippet": "''MY boss ruled like a dictator,'' recalled Iris Marchaj of her days at an executive placement firm in Massachusetts.
