Almost everyone can shed pounds on almost any diet, at least for a while, but few can predict or control the sometimes paradoxical psychological accompaniments to dieting: the distorted body images that do not grow slimmer even when real appearance does, the self-loathing and low self-esteem that thwart the efforts to reduce, the relationships that crumble because weight is lost, as well as the anxiety and depression - what one psychologist calls ''the fear of thinness'' - that may set in when the diet is successful. Given the stigma of obesity in American society, it is little wonder that dieters frequently expect their lives to change dramatically, as in a fairy tale, once the desired weight has been reached. But a diet's outcome is not necessarily pleasant. Sudden changes in the way others respond to a formerly obese person can precipitate an emotional crisis, as when a 25-year-old woman, overweight since infancy, is frightened because she is confronting men's sexual advances for the first time.", "snippet": "FOR many people, weight loss turns out to be the most trivial aspect of dieting.

So are the coffers of a largely unregulated $10-billion industry that purports to assist people in shedding unwanted pounds via drugs, devices, salons, special foods and a never-ending stream of best-selling diet schemes. While the desperate resort to such extremes as prolonged fasts, stapling the stomach, jaw wiring and intestinal bypass surgery, the majority of weight-conscious Americans hop from one fad diet to another searching vainly for a shortcut to slimness, and sometimes jeopardizing their health in the process. Yet, experts report, 80 to 90 percent of dieters soon regain lost pounds and often then some, only to try still another diet in what the nutritionist Dr. Jean Mayer has dubbed ''the rhythm method of girth control.'' ''If there was an effective diet,'' said Dr. George A. Bray of the University of California at Los Angeles, ''there would be no need for the continuous introduction of new diets: the 'Grapefruit Diet,' the 'Drinking Man's Diet,' the 'Air Force Diet,' the 'Mayo Diet,' the 'Quick Weight Loss Diet' and so on. It seems obvious from the number of diets that have been made available and are continuing to appear, none of them provides the answer to obesity.''", "snippet": "DESPITE the national obsession with diets and dieting, 80 million Americans are overweight and, a recent national survey showed, the average person today is fatter than ever before.

Stores of fat in the body increase when food intake is persistently greater than the body's energy use, but controls over this are complex. They involve a constellation of hormonal and nervous system factors, orchestrated ultimately by the hypothalamus, a deep-seated portion of the brain that is involved with emotion as well as basic physiological controls. By studying such controls and the ways in which they can go awry, scientists look toward a future that might provide new approaches to mastering obesity. The attention of many scientists today is focused on the biochemical controls over the fat cells and related aspects of fat storage.", "snippet": "THE more scientists study the problem of overweight and the difficulty of shedding extra pounds, the more it seems that brain and body chemistry control the outcome.
