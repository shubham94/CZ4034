Then a young biologist, she was writing a dissertation on the physiology of coldblooded animals. Her creature of choice was Bufo boreas, named for the ancient Greek god of the north wind, an extravagant tag for a warty, blotchy, four-inch toad. It is more commonly and appropriately known as the western toad, its range encompassing the mountains of western North America. Twice a week, Carey went into the vast, pristine wilderness of Colorado to do her research. At times the toads were so plentiful she had to be careful when driving away not to crush them under her wheels. In 1973, two years into her work, the illness struck. When she went into the field, Carey started coming upon an alarming sight: dozens of dying toads, toads barely able to move because their legs were puffy and red. She took one back to a veterinarian, who told her the toads were dying from an opportunistic infection because their immune systems had collapsed. But why? Carey was in no position to unravel the mystery -- she had a dissertation to do. But by 1979, there were no western toads, healthy or sick, to be found at any of the previous sites, or anywhere else in Colorado she looked. \"These are wilderness areas,\" she says today from her laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where she is an associate professor of biology. \"There was no development, no housing, no habitat destruction.
