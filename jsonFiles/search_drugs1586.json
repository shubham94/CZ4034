The decision means that the antiviral drug, also known as AZT, can be dispensed immediately to thousands more patients than originally indicated. Less than two weeks ago officials of the company, which makes AZT, said that until the drug was licensed for commercial marketing they would provide it only to patients who have had a single, initial attack of the form of pneumonia, Pneumocystis carinii, within 120 days. Many AIDS victims and physicians objected that these limits were arbitrary and would lead desperate patients and sympathetic doctors to resort to deception to obtain the drug.", "headline": {"main": "TEST GROUP FOR AIDS DRUG IS BROADENED TO INCLUDE 7,000"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "6", "word_count": 685, "_id": "4fd170d48eb7c8105d663eb8", "snippet": "The group eligible to receive azidothymidine, the first drug to show promise against AIDS, has been broadened to include most of the 7,000 AIDS victims who have suffered a specific form of pneumonia, the Burroughs Wellcome Company announced...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/01/us/test-group-for-aids-drug-is-broadened-to-include-7000.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BURROUGHS WELLCOME CO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AZIDOTHYMIDINE (DRUG)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TESTS AND TESTING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NEW MODELS, DESIGN AND PRODUCTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS AND DRUG TRADE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PNEUMONIA"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Erik", "lastname": "ECKHOLM"}], "original": "By ERIK ECKHOLM"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1986-10-01T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; U.S."}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Living Desk", "lead_paragraph": "EVERY year at about this time - the start of the peak season for colds - researchers announce yet another promising way of treating this common ailment. Recent possibilities include drugs that block the proliferation of cold viruses and substances that help the body resist them. The latest is a nasal spray with antibodies that prevent the largest group of cold viruses from entering cells in the nasal passages, where most colds begin. But the general use of such techniques is years in the future, if indeed they ever prove practical and effective. Meanwhile, Americans spend well over $500 million a year on over-the-counter remedies in hopes of defeating the common cold. Not that people are now less tolerant of colds than their ancestors. Ancient remedies could fill a book -among them ingesting snakeskin, wrapping a dirty sock around the neck, passing the victim three times under the belly of a horse and tying the skin of fish to the feet. Perhaps the most time-honored was to place a hat on a bedpost, get into bed and drink alcohol until one sees two hats.", "headline": {"main": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "4", "word_count": 1396, "_id": "4fd158758eb7c8105d63ccd9", "snippet": "EVERY year at about this time - the start of the peak season for colds - researchers announce yet another promising way of treating this common ailment.
