That is a lot worse than simply looking old because it means that they may have a shorter life expectancy than their age would give them. It also means that they are susceptible to serious illnesses that normally afflict older people. That is what Richard Y. discovered after being hospitalized at age 40 with severe chest pains. The frightening pains turned out to be only an inflamed tendon, but while he was in the hospital he discovered that various factors about his life had, in effect, transformed him into a man of 50 and that a real heart attack might not be so far off.", "headline": {"main": "Personal Health; IF YOUR MEDICAL AGE IS TOO GREAT"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1024, "_id": "4fd1231c8eb7c8105d5e6d1d", "snippet": "MOST people dread the idea of looking older than they really are, but few realize that, medically speaking, they may actually be older than their chronological age.

Biocraft produced its copy for a modest $350,000 and sells it at less than half the price of Bactrim and Septra. In doing so, it exploited a recent ruling by the Food and Drug Administration that is creating a stir in the pharmaceutical industry. The ruling permits small drug manufacturers to borrow heavily from previous studies of pioneering research companies in filing for F.D.A. approval of new drugs. Initially made last December, the ruling encountered, and was upheld in, a first round of legal challeges. It was restated in mid-April by Richard S. Schweiker, Secretary of Health and Human Services.", "headline": {"main": "BIG DRUG CONCERNS FIGHT F.D.A."}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "29", "word_count": 984, "_id": "4fd11b718eb7c8105d5d70a8", "snippet": "Just a few months ago, Biocraft Laboratories Inc., a small drug manufacturer, began selling a new tablet that is a chemical copy of Bactrim and Septra, two infection-fighting drugs that have been on the market since 1973.
