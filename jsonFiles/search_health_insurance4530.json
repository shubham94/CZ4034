{"status": "OK", "response": {"docs": [{"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "lead_paragraph": "WHEN I TELL PEOPLE THAT I went to Bennington College, it often happens that, whether they've been there or not, they want to tell me a story about it. Sometimes they tell me about the article they read in Esquire some 20 years ago on how the faculty ran the young president, Gail Parker, out of town because she and a history teacher named Rush Welter hatched a plan to cut faculty, alter student majors and more or less recreate the school. Or they recall that Bennington is where Camille Paglia, the woman who later published the brilliant, maddening \"Sexual Personae,\" kicked a student three times for parodying her Uzi lecture style; afterward she claimed that the kicks were parodic, too. From the legendary days of the 1940's, when Miriam Marx, Groucho's daughter, was said to have quartered her horse in her dorm room -- and afterward was suspended from the college -- Bennington has been American higher education's School for Scandal. But, I often find myself insisting (sometimes after adding a few tales of my own), it's been a good deal more than that. Bennington is one of the places where Martha Graham helped invent modern dance. It's where Kenneth Burke, the great critic and man of letters, taught for many years, along with Stanley Kunitz, Howard Nemerov, Stanley Edgar Hyman, Theodore Roethke, W. H. Auden, Bernard Malamud; the list goes on. Bennington has been the home of major composers like Henry Brant and Vivian Fine. A number of consequential American artists have been associated with the college, among them Jules Olitski, David Smith, Kenneth Noland, Helen Frankenthaler. At Bennington, Buckminster Fuller built one of his first geodesic domes. The school pioneered workshop approaches to writing and set the arts on par with the academic disciplines before much of anyone else was willing to. Bennington was originally a women's college, and its feminism has often been well in advance of the rest of the country's. From its founding in 1932, the School for Scandal has had more than a little to teach its academic betters.", "headline": {"main": "Bennington Means Business"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "40", "word_count": 6879, "_id": "4fd1e6c38eb7c8105d733483", "snippet": "WHEN I TELL PEOPLE THAT I went to Bennington College, it often happens that, whether they've been there or not, they want to tell me a story about it.
