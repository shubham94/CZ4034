Since the nature of consciousness is a fundamental mystery, perhaps it is not surprising that the art of rendering people unconscious also defies exact understanding. These gaps in knowledge mean that anesthesiologists have no reliable ways to gauge when a person is unconscious. On rare occasions patients wake up during surgery. \"I came out of the anesthetic and couldn't understand why I wasn't in the ward,\" said one patient who was undergoing surgery in a British hospital, quoted in a recent book on anesthesia. \"I could see the surgeons at the end of the operating table and I thought, 'Oh, my God, they're going to operate on me and I'm awake.' I tried to tell them, but I couldn't speak -- couldn't move. It was the worst experience of my life.\"", "headline": {"main": "New Ideas on Mystery Of How Anesthetics Work"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1455, "_id": "4fd1e4b58eb7c8105d72f455", "snippet": "ANESTHESIA is one of the most effective medical interventions yet one of the least understood.
