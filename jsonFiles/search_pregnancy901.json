How unfortunate that this form of therapy is largely available only to upper-income couples. Most marriage counseling is not covered by insurance, despite the fact that troubled marriages may lead to depression, anxiety and substance abuse, which can result in lost productivity and high additional health-care costs, to say nothing of divorce and its impact on children. The current in-vogue therapy, largely dictated by what insurance companies will and will not cover, is short-term cognitive behavioral therapy.

An entire industry of weather bookies -- scientists who calculate the likelihood of various natural disasters -- had in effect set the odds: a storm that destroys $70 billion of insured property should strike the United States only once every 100 years. New Orleanians had made an art form of ignoring threats far more likely than this; indeed, their carelessness was a big reason they were supposedly more charming than other Americans. And it was true: New Orleanians found pleasure even in oblivion. But in their blindness to certain threats, they could not have been more typically American. From Miami to San Francisco, the nation's priciest real estate now faced beaches and straddled fault lines; its most vibrant cities occupied its most hazardous land.
