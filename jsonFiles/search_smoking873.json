For those who do not, many other options are available to help limit the immediate and distant health effects of the menopausal decline in estrogen. Hormone replacement is clearly not for every menopausal woman. Some have medical conditions or family medical histories that make hormone therapy inadvisable. Some fear the suspected long-term risks, like breast cancer, and others react adversely to the treatment. Even among those who start hormone therapy, only about one-third use it regularly, and many abandon the treatments after the most common immediate symptoms of menopause, hot flashes, subside.", "snippet": "DESPITE renewed interest in estrogens to treat the sometimes distressing symptoms of menopause and its long-term effects on the health of the heart and bones, fewer than one woman in five who has reached that stage of life now uses hormone..."}, {"word_count": 828, "slideshow_credits": null, "multimedia": [], "news_desk": "Financial Desk", "pub_date": "1992-05-20T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/20/business/economic-scene-heading-off-heroin-s-return.html", "blog": [], "_id": "4fd19fc08eb7c8105d6b3eda", "headline": {"main": "Economic Scene; Heading Off Heroin's Return"}, "subsection_name": null, "abstract": null, "section_name": "Business", "byline": {"original": "By Peter Passell", "person": [{"rank": 1, "firstname": "Peter", "lastname": "Passell", "role": "reported", "organization": ""}]}, "print_page": "2", "document_type": "article", "type_of_material": "News", "keywords": [{"value": "ECONOMIC SCENE (TIMES COLUMN)", "name": "creative_works"}, {"value": "KLEIMAN, MARK A R", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "HEROIN", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "COCAINE", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "DRUG ABUSE AND TRAFFIC", "name": "subject"}], "lead_paragraph": "WHAT turned thousands of ordinarily law-abiding citizens of Los Angeles into looters? While the seeds of the Los Angeles riots were surely nurtured in the deep muck of poverty and racial rage, economists who study illicit markets suggest there is a lot to be learned about explosive changes in crime from mundane analysis of deterrence and opportunity. And the most striking explanation for such discontinuities is what Mark A. R. Kleiman of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government calls \"enforcement swamping\" -- the disequilibrium created when forces of deterrence are overwhelmed. Once stated, the idea seems obvious: lawbreaking can have positive feedback effects, making it \"cheaper\" for others to join the fray. But obvious ideas can be profound. Mr. Kleiman, the author of a new book on drug policy, \"Against Excess\" (Basic Books), contends that enforcement swamping explains why the use of crack cocaine reached epidemic proportions in the 1980's in spite of the billions spent to fight it. And failure to learn from that failure, he argues, could lead to a heroin epidemic in the 1990's.", "snippet": "WHAT turned thousands of ordinarily law-abiding citizens of Los Angeles into looters?
