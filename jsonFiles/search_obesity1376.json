The current disagreement is between two long-time adversaries. the Sugar Association and the Center for Science in the Public Interest. On July 2, the Center for Science, a consumer advocacy group, wrote to Richard S. Schweiker, Secretary of Health and Human Services, urging him to convene a special scientific panel to evaluate the impact of refined sweeteners on the health of Americans and to recommend further research. In the letter, which was signed by 10 scientists, nutritionists and physicians, the center suggested possible ties between sugar intake and heart disease and diabetes, concluding that ''Americans now eat 14 megatons of sugar each year.'' We believe that this 14-megaton bomb is contributing significantly to health problems,'' the letter said.", "snippet": "The latest chapter in the continuing argument over the place of sugar in the American diet seems to offer no more reliable guidelines to consumers now than it did about 10 years ago,when the controversy began to gain momentum.
