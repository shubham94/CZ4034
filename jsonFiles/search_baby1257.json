The introductions also represent an attempt by Procter & Gamble and Frito-Lay, to enter - and capture - a healthy chunk of the $4.2 billion ready-baked store-bought cookie market now dominated by Nabisco. The new products are mainly designed to appeal to adults, and to the kind of people who prefer ''home style'' cookies but don't have the time to bake them. Dallas-based Frito-Lay, a subsidiary of Pepsico Inc. and the nation's undisputed king of salted snack foods, was the first into the fray. In May 1982 it rolled a line of 16 Grandma's Cookies into supermarkets in the Kansas City area. The cookies, generally soft, chewy versions of old favorites, now are available to about a third of the nation's population, primarily in the Southwest, Middle West, West and Southeast.", "headline": {"main": "NEW ENTRIES IN A COOKIE RACE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 910, "_id": "4fd13cec8eb7c8105d61373c", "snippet": "A multimillion- dollar introduction of new products by three of the nation's biggest marketing guns, the Procter & Gamble Company, Nabisco Brands and Frito- Lay Inc., is trying to stir up the stagnant grocery store cookie market.
