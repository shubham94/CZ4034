His hair was newly cropped in the trademark close fade that inspires his friends to call him Baldheaded Shawn, or Barkley, after Charles Barkley, the basketball star. Around his neck he wore a small gold lion, a gift from his older brother, a sergeant in the Army. His backpack held his track shoes and his books. Not long ago, Shawn Hunt, who at age 11 was a messenger for the neighborhood drug dealers and three years later was packing a .25-caliber pistol, seemed headed only for jail. But this year, at 17, almost everything has changed: He is an honor student at Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in Brooklyn, co-captain of the track team, a youth leader at his church. He holds down a part-time clerical job at Downstate Medical Center. Next fall he plans to attend Clark-Atlanta University in Georgia. He would like to be a psychologist or a sports-medicine doctor.", "headline": {"main": "Shawn, 17: Running Past Many Obstacles"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2719, "_id": "4fd1bcce8eb7c8105d6e88eb", "snippet": "\"I'm a powerful, intellectual man going somewhere,\" said Shawn Hunt, talking about his future as he hurried from high school to a track meet.
