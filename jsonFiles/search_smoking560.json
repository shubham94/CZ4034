It is associated with a mortality rate of 1 percent to 2 percent; some patients suffer surgery-related strokes, and in the years that follow, as many as half of bypassed vessels themselves become clogged, requiring another bypass or some other procedure to restore adequate coronary blood flow.", "snippet": "Coronary bypass surgery to circumvent clogged arteries that feed the heart has, since its inception in the 1960's, brought relief from crippling chest pain and significantly prolonged life for millions of people.
