When I pulled into town one Saturday evening in mid-December (behind the wheel of my rather gaseous-smelling rented VW bug), he was getting ready to sound the call to Mass. The sun was setting in a pink wave on the horizon, and soon the little town filled with song emanating from the custard-yellow church. There could be no better welcome to Todos Santos or sweeter reward for making the long, hard, occasionally unnerving trip 1,000 miles south from the Mexican border at Tijuana to the tip of the Baja Peninsula. I'd come part of the way with my brother, John, who lives in Los Angeles. But after five days of exploring the northern Baja from the front seat of his intrepid four-wheel-drive vehicle, he'd turned back at the dusty town of Guerrero Negro, just south of the 28th Parallel, which slices the long, wild peninsula roughly in half. There I'd caught a bus south (for $25, converted at 6.9 pesos to the United States dollar), zigzagging through shadeless forests of cardon cactuses in the Vizcaino Desert and the barren Sierra de la Giganta before finally arriving in La Paz 12 hours later. After an overnight in La Paz, another three-hour bus ride (for $6.50) took me to Cabo San Lucas, where I stayed just long enough to catch a cab to the airport and claim my rental car.
