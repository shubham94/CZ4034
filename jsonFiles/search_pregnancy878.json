SERENA WILLIAMS LOSES IN ROME -- Serena Williams made an array of mistakes yesterday in her final match before the French Open, losing to Patty Schnyder, 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (5), at the Italian Open quarterfinals in Rome. Schnyder will face third-seeded Jelena Jankovic, who routed Elena Dementieva, 6-2, 6-1. Second-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova and ninth-seeded Daniela Hantuchova will play in the other semifinal. PRO FOOTBALL WILLIAMS NOT IN DOLPHINS' PLANS -- If running back Ricky Williams makes a comeback, it will probably be with a new team. ''I will not allow our fans to be let down by people that are not on our roster -- not again,'' said Cam Cameron, the Dolphins' first year coach. An N.F.L. rushing champion for Miami in 2002, Williams, who turns 30 on Monday, tested positive for marijuana again last month, which will delay his return to the league until at least September. His current suspension began in April 2006 after he violated the league's drug policy for the fourth time. CONGRESSMAN WANTS VICK PUNISHED -- A California congressman has joined the cause against Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, writing a letter yesterday that urged N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell to ''act swiftly and forcefully'' if Vick was involved in dog fighting on his former property. The congressman, Representative Tom Lantos, Democrat of California, is a senior member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He raised the prospect of government intervention if the N.F.L. failed to discipline Vick. ''I am outraged that one of the National Football League's superstars is affiliated with such a heinous enterprise,'' Lantos wrote. BENGALS LINEBACKER ARRESTED -- Cincinnati linebacker A. J. Nicholson was arrested on a domestic violence charge yesterday, the first arrest of a Bengals player since Commissioner Roger Goodell cracked down on misconduct last month. Nicholson was already one of nine Bengals players arrested during a nine-month stretch, turning the team into a prime example of player misconduct. The police in Taylor Mill, Ky., arrested Nicholson after a woman called 911 yesterday afternoon to say that she had been assaulted by Nicholson. He was charged with fourth-degree assault, a misdemeanor. COLLEGES REVIEW FOR RULES ON PREGNANCY -- The N.C.A.A.'s committee on women in sports will review its guidelines amid reports of female athletes being threatened with the loss of scholarships if they became pregnant. Janet Kittell, the leader of the N.C.A.A.'s committee on women's athletics, said that her group would review the rules on pregnancy in July. Last week, Cassandra Harding, a member of the Memphis track team, told The Associated Press that she lost her scholarship after becoming pregnant, and a Clemson athlete told ESPN that she had an abortion to stay in college. YACHT RACING AMERICAN TEAM FALLS FURTHER BACK -- BMW Oracle Racing, the American entry, lost to the Italian boat Luna Rossa yesterday in the Louis Vuitton Cup and trails, 3-1, in their best-of-nine semifinal series in Valencia, Spain. The fifth-flight race is scheduled for today. Emirates Team New Zealand has a 3-1 advantage against Spain's Desafio Espa\u00f1ol in the other semifinal.

Did the butcher of Baraboo, Wis., kill her husband? Find out in this black comedy (2:00). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422. 'CRAZY MARY' In previews; opens on June 3. In A. R. Gurney's new play, Sigourney Weaver stars as a woman who discovers that her cousin, the title character, who is a patient in a psychiatric hospital, holds the keys to the family fortune (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'IN A DARK DARK HOUSE' In previews; opens on June 7. Neil LaBute's latest drama features Frederick Weller and Ron Livingston as hostile siblings sorting out a history of abuse (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. 'PHALLACY' Opens tonight. An art historian and a chemistry professor argue over the authenticity and value of a statue in this new drama by the scientist and playwright Carl Djerassi (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. 'TEA' Previews start on Sunday. Opens on May 30. Set in Kansas in 1968, this play is about four Japanese war brides who gather to mourn a friend. West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101. '10 MILLION MILES' In previews; opens on June 14. A new musical by the singer Patty Griffin and the playwright Keith Bunin (''The Busy World Is Hushed'') is about a road trip from Florida to New York. Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200. 'XANADU' Previews start on Wednesday. Opens on June 26. The 1980 cult roller disco film about a Greek muse sent to earth goes Broadway -- and it's about time. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Ra\u00fal Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CORAM BOY' Set in 18th-century England, this melodrama about imperiled orphans is big and broad but not particularly deep. With a cast of 40, an orchestra in the pit and bursts of choral music (Handel, mostly) decorating the proceedings, it is tastefully splashy and certainly impressive, but less emotionally engaging than you might hope (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MIS\u00c9RABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BETROTHED' Rachel Dickstein weds dance and spoken drama in a distinctive theatrical language. The marriages in this lovely and uneven work are less convincing: aiming to depict women's views about matrimony, this piece, based on three dissimilar short stories, actually depicts marriage as an imprisoning convention from which all three heroines escape. It's no accident that the first part of this triptych, based on Jhumpa Lahiri's story ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar,'' provides the defining image of the work as a whole: wreathed in a haze of (implied) incense and saffron, this lovely sequence is the strongest of the evening (1:20). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DAUGHTER OF A CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY' A standard-issue solo play about a fascinating Cuban family (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GOD'S EAR' Jenny Schwartz's formally inventive and brilliantly performed drama about how the death of a child affects a family is more interested in language than in narrative (1:20). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clich\u00e9d territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE RECeiPT' A lost bar receipt provides a one-way ticket to bedlam in a clever and diverting show that mirrors the idiosyncrasies of modern life as two young archaeologists study a ''lost'' city and postulate on a day in the life of one of its inhabitants (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Wilborn Hampton) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway * 'HAMLET' Gorilla Rep specializes in outdoor performances of Shakespeare; this workshop is an indoor performance of an outdoor performance, which removes the gimmick and leaves, simply, good theater. The strong cast revolves around note-perfect portrayals of Claudius and Gertrude (Elizabeth McGuire is particularly fine); of the Polonius family (Al Twanmo plays the patriarch as a kind of insurance salesman battling forgetfulness); and, finally, of Hamlet, which Jacob H. Knoll pulls off as an angry young Dane. Christopher Carter Sanderson, the director, shows that the play's the thing, indoors or out (3:00). Roy Arias Theater Center at Times Square Arts Center, 300 West 43rd Street, Clinton. (Midgette) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' A writhing green blob with music (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BAD BLOOD (MALASANGRE)' A wife is offered a lucrative job in Texas; her husband moves with her from Puerto Rico but rails against the condition of being a Latino in the United States. Presented in Spanish and English on different nights, this play by Roberto Ramos Perea is full of ideas and anger, but the political fury of the husband is not, in the English version, completely borne out by his characterization, and you can see the charting of the play a little too clearly between the lines (2:30). Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 354-1293; closes on Sunday. (Midgette) 'BEYOND THERAPY' This Christopher Durang play is still pretty funny, and all the more interesting because it is performed in American Sign Language by New York Deaf Theater. Unobtrusive speaking actors provide the dialogue for the benefit of nonsigners, but in the production's best moments they're hardly needed, so animated are the actors and their hands (1:45.) Actors Theater Workshop, 145 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger) 'COUPLES' An evening of eight one-acts offers an update on the battle of the sexes. Some skits work better than others, but each has a kernel of conflict and flashes of humor. Likewise, some characters are more fully drawn, while others border on stereotype. The best of the two-handers, however, is both funny and poignant (1:40). WorkShop Theater Company, 312 West 36th Street, fourth floor, (212) 695-4173; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) 'ON THE VERGE' An amusing revival of Eric Overmyer's play about three Victoria-era ladies who set out, armed with parasols and machetes, to explore a terra incognita. As they ''whack the bushes'' into virgin territory, they soon discover they are traveling into the future (2:00). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 777-4280; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) 'REALISM' and 'JUMP!' The stately Jean Cocteau Repertory (now known as the Exchange) gets a hipster makeover with two foul-mouthed and aggressive new provocations from Britain (1:30 each). Kirk Theater, 420 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) * 'WEST MOON STREET' Rob Urbinati's adaptation of Oscar Wilde's short story ''Lord Arthur Savile's Crime'' delightfully mines a comedy of manners, a meditation on premarital fear, out of a clever mystery of fate. The performances, one and all, are first-rate (2:00). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'CASTING ABOUT' (No rating, 86 minutes) The documentary filmmaker Barry J. Hershey (''The Empty Mirror'') has created this record of casting calls for lead actresses in a dramatic feature that he wrote but has yet to direct: a seemingly Hemingwayesque drama involving a wounded combat photographer, a nun, a dancer and a painter's model. ''Casting About'' is a solid documentary about how art is made but it is also an unnerving inquiry into power relationships between filmmakers and performers and, more pointedly, between men and women. (Matt Zoller Seitz) THE CONDEMNED' (R, 100 minutes) This simple-minded vehicle for the wrestling star Steve Austin follows a bunch of muscle-bound lowlifes as they fight to the death for the benefit of an Internet reality show. Leaden and inept, the movie fails to deliver even the action goods, presenting every fight scene in such quaking, extreme close-up that it's difficult to tell who's pummeling whom. Fortunately, the language of pain is universal. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'DAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT' (No rating, 94 minutes) For most of its 94 minutes, this gripping but evasive portrait of an unidentified 19-year-old terrorist undertaking a suicide bombing mission in Times Square focuses on the face of its star, Luisa Williams. (Holden) 'DELTA FARCE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) In his second vehicle Larry the Cable Guy takes greater risks, sharing significant screen time with two co-stars (his ''Blue Collar Comedy'' colleague Bill Engvall and D J Qualls) and asking viewers to accept him as a soldier and romantic leading man. When he and his buds are plunked down in Mexico en route to Iraq and liberate a village plagued by marauders, a metaphor for the war proves utterly brain-dead. For starters, where's the oil? (Andy Webster) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) 'THE EX' (PG-13, 89 minutes) The best jokes in this scattershot screwball satire -- about the cutthroat workplace, job insecurity, upward mobility, political correctness, yuppie marital tensions, and the disabled -- have claws that leave scratches. (Holden) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Dargis) 'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than an entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP ALONE' (No rating, 115 minutes, in Taiwanese, Malay, Mandarin and Bengali) A dreamy, melancholy tale of three-way desire, shot in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and imagined by the director Tsai Ming-Liang with his usual blend of sensuality and formal rigor. (Scott) 'IN THE LAND OF WOMEN' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This mopey comedy is the film equivalent of a sensitive emo band with one foot in alternative rock and the other in the squishy pop mainstream. The movie would like to think of itself as a softer, fuzzier ''Garden State.'' (Holden) 'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn that there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) 'LUCKY YOU' (PG-13, 124 minutes) Eric Bana plays a poker player with daddy issues (Robert Duvall is his dad), and Drew Barrymore is an aspiring singer who catches his eye in this tepid Las Vegas romance. It's not terrible, just content to break even. (Scott) 'MEET THE ROBINSONS' (G, 93 minutes) Actually, if you see them coming, run in the other direction. (Scott) 'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) 'PROVOKED' (No rating, 113 minutes) Holding fast to the movie-of-the-week formula perfected by Lifetime Television, Jag Mundhra's overly restrained drama is based on the true story of Kiranjit Ahluwalia, a London-based Punjabi housewife who torched her sleeping husband in 1989 after suffering a decade of abuse. Unfortunately, by keeping its inflammatory subject matter at arm's length, ''Provoked'' does exactly the same to its audience. (Catsoulis) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Seitz) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Rachel Saltz) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'THE TREATMENT' (No rating, 86 minutes) Oren Rydavsky's adaptation of the Daniel Menaker novel about love and psychoanalysis in New York has its heart and head in the right place, but not much else, including its sympathetic stars, Chris Eigeman, Famke Janssen and Ian Holm. (Dargis) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series JEAN GENET ON FILM (Monday and Tuesday) This French writer, radical and colorful ex-criminal is represented by two of his works adapted for film: Christopher Miles's 1974 version of ''The Maids,'' starring Glenda Jackson and Susannah York (Monday), and Tony Richardson's ''Mademoiselle'' (1966), based on a Genet story as touched up by Marguerite Duras (Tuesday).

(Dave Kehr) JULES AND JIM (Today through Sunday) Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's New Wave classic, about two best friends (Oskar Werner and Henri Serre) who fall in love with the same spritely woman (Jeanne Moreau) on the eve of World War I, is the designated ''Weekend Classic'' this week at the IFC Center. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $11. (Kehr) ALLAN KING (Tonight through Thursday) A continuing retrospective devoted to one of Canada's most accomplished documentary-makers, who is not to be confused with his near-namesake, the comedian Alan King. This is unlikely for anyone who has seen the searing film ''A Married Couple,'' Mr. King's 1969 cin\u00e9ma-verit\u00e9 study of a marriage in crisis, which is screening tonight. ''The Dragon's Egg: Making Peace on the Wreckage of the Twentieth Century'' (1999), screening tomorrow, concerns the uneasy relationship between native Estonians and the Russians imported into their country by Stalin. ''Dying at Grace'' (2003), one of Mr. King's most recent films, is an intimate portrait of five terminal patients in a Toronto Salvation Army hospital (Wednesday and Thursday). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) LEE MARVIN: THE COOLEST LETHAL WEAPON (Today through Thursday) Week 2 of a retrospective devoted to Marvin, a silver-haired ex-marine who became one of the last great movie stars. Highlights this week include ''The Spikes Gang,'' a rarely screened 1974 coming-of-age film directed by the perennially underestimated Richard Fleischer and featuring Marvin as a wounded outlaw who takes three teenagers under his wing (tonight and tomorrow); Robert Aldrich's 1973 Darwinian duke-out ''Emperor of the North Pole'' (Saturday and Tuesday); and, for the truly fearless, a brand new print of Joshua Logan's insanely misconceived musical ''Paint Your Wagon'' (Sunday), with a talk-singing Marvin joining the nonsinging Jean Seberg and the barely verbal Clint Eastwood in a frontier m\u00e9nage-\u00e0-trois. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

(Ben Sisario) JOSEPH ARTHUR (Wednesday) Romance, despair and the struggle for faith intermingle in Mr. Arthur's songs, which can float in a gorgeous acoustic reverie or flare up in electrified anger. With Stars of Track and Field. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) DAN BERN (Tuesday) With a nasal sing-speak that recalls the young Bob Dylan, Dan Bern offers smooth folk-rock and a world-weary cynicism. (''There's nothing innocent about a newborn babe,'' he sings, ''that a few years here can't cure.'') At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $16.

Also on the bill this week is Mike Viola, whose strident power-pop is laced with jagged wit. At 8 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; no cover. Mr. Campilongo's trio also plays on Thursday at 8 p.m. at Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10. (Sisario) * VINICIO CAPOSSELA (Tuesday) Calling himself an ''enchanter,'' Mr. Capossela, one of the cleverest and most eccentric musicians in Italy, spins enigmatic fantasies of both skid row Americana and mythological Italy in a grittily elegant cabaret-jazz style that recalls Tom Waits and Paolo Conte. He makes his American debut at Joe's Pub with a band that will include the guitarist Marc Ribot, a Waits collaborator who has appeared on Mr. Capossela's records as well.

(Sisario) CITIZEN COPE (Sunday) Clarence Greenwood, a k a Citizen Cope, is the umpteenth singer-songwriter to use hip-hop beats and drawled, rap-sung vocals in search of novelty.

At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) COCOROSIE (Tomorrow) As CocoRosie, the Casady sisters, Sierra and Bianca, make a swirling psychodrama out of hints of trip-hop, chirping crickets and cooed Billie Holiday-ish vocals. For this concert they will be accompanied by teenage poets presented by UrbanWord NYC, an organization that offers free writing workshops for young people. At 7:30 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. (Sisario) DEVIN THE DUDE (Tonight) This Houston rapper, a raunchy but self-deprecating comedian with a mellow flow, has lingered on the fringes of fame since making an appearance on Dr. Dre's album ''2001,'' released eight years ago. He might learn a lesson from Snoop Dogg, Andr\u00e9 3000 and the other big names who have guest spots on his new album, ''Waitin' to Inhale'' (Rap-a-Lot): nobody becomes a rap star by being laid-back, man. With Bavu Blakes, Grit Boys, Surreal, DJ Kutz, Gator and DJ Rapid Ric. At 10, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) * FROG EYES (Tonight and tomorrow night) One of the quickly multiplying side projects of members of the Canadian indie-arty band Wolf Parade (see also Handsome Furs, below), Frog Eyes sets Carey Mercer's frantic, David Bowie-like vocals against even more frantic keyboards and guitars, creating the melody-overload soundtrack to life in fast-forward. With Alex Delivery and Chris Garneau. Tonight at 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12.

(Sisario) * BEBEL GILBERTO (Tuesday and Wednesday) Bossa nova becomes a cool drink of electronics-infused bubbly in the songs of Ms. Gilberto, who, like her father, Jo\u00e3o Gilberto, makes her music as weightless as it is delicious. With Federico Aubele. At 7:30 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $25. (Sisario) * HANDSOME FURS (Wednesday and Thursday) ''What we had don't mean a thing'' may not be the kind of lyric you'd expect from an engaged couple. But as Handsome Furs, Dan Boeckner of Wolf Parade and his fianc\u00e9e, Alexei Perry, play bleak, hollow dirges propped up by bluesy guitar and spare electronics. It's darkly beautiful and has a ring of honesty, but still, can you imagine the honeymoon? With TK Webb on Wednesday and Sam Jayne on Thursday. At 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) HEAVEN AND HELL (Tomorrow) Black Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio in place of Ozzy Osbourne. Again. Which means it's effectively 1980 and not very exciting. Again.

(Sisario) * JESUS AND MARY CHAIN (Monday and Tuesday) In the mid-'80s, William and Jim Reid of this Scottish band proved that to make so-called revolutionary rock all you need is a Beach Boys chord progression, dark waves of feedback and a whole lot of slouch. But to have a legacy -- the kind that makes people buy pricey tickets to a reunion concert, like this one -- you also need durable songs, and if the Reids' nihilistic bonbons (''Just Like Honey,'' ''Darklands'') were never hits exactly, they remain paragons of melodic economy, disfigured by noise. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) JUCIFER (Tuesday) For a two-member group -- Amber Valentine on guitar and vocals, Edgar Livengood on drums -- Jucifer makes a mighty noise with its songs about death and desolation. It blasts its way through power-chorded mayhem, slow or at punk speeds, topped by Ms. Valentine's airy voice. With Object and Skeleton Breath. At 7 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $10. (Jon Pareles) TALIB KWELI (Tonight) This socially conscious Brooklyn rapper, the former partner of Mos Def in the seminal '90s group Black Star, is interested in much more than bling. With a hard-nosed, staccato style, he rhymes about ghetto entropy and geopolitics: ''I wanna write the songs to right the wrongs.'' At 11, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $35. (Sisario) MARTINA McBRIDE (Tonight) Nobody delivers a heavy-handed ''social issue'' song like Ms. McBride, whose soaring country-rock can make numbers about battered women (''Independence Day''), abused children (''Concrete Angel'') and teenage pregnancy (''Beautiful Again'') sound upbeat. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $35 to $90. (Sisario) 'MOUNTAIN STAGE' (Tomorrow) Sooner or later every old-fashioned country radio program comes to New York for a broadcast from the big city.

(Sisario) NO FUN FEST (Tonight through Sunday) Now something of a spring tradition, this four-day festival of noise-rock -- and any other kind of avant-garde music, as long as it's clamorous and loud -- concludes this weekend. Tonight are Incapacitants, Mouthus with Axolotl, Sissy Spacek and Carlos Giffoni, the festival's organizer. Tomorrow's bill has the most potential, with the veteran Japanese noisemongers Merzbow and Keiji Haino, as well as Demons, Religious Knives, Tom Recchion and Oblivia.

(Sisario) JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Wednesday) Ms. O'Connor's portraits of the lovelorn and depressed, sung with the guileless vulnerability of a 2 a.m. phone confession, are dry but not unsympathetic: ''Maybe she's on her lunch break thinking of you.'' She has a Wednesday residency this month at the Living Room. At 11 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) OLLABELLE (Tonight) This local quintet of two women and three men worships blues, country and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes, playing traditional songs like ''John the Revelator'' and originals that connect them to classic roots-rock. At 7:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) OXFORD COLLAPSE (Thursday) Drawing from the tense jangle of 1970s and early-'80s American groups like Television and the Feelies -- a refreshing shift from the Gang of Four-Joy Division axis that has defined New York retro-rock for years -- Oxford Collapse beefs up its anxious, speedy songs with cathartic smashes and unison chants. With Centipede E'est and Excellent. At 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $8. (Sisario) * JOHN PIZZARELLI AND JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) These married musicians have been called ''the Nick and Nora of cabaret,'' a sobriquet that only begins to describe their upbeat sophistication. They fuse two distantly related musical worlds into a larger whole in which Stephen Sondheim, Dave Frishberg, Paul Simon, and Lambert, Hendricks and Ross join hands. (Through May 26.) At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Caf\u00e9 Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 and $125 Tuesday through Thursday; $85 tonight and tomorrow.

With Moonrats and Call Me Lightning. At 9 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $15.50. (Sisario) ANNIE ROSS (Tuesday) When this jazz legend barks out ''I Got Rhythm,'' she turns this great Gershwin standard into a hipster's credo. If you've got as much rhythm in your body and music in your head as Ms. Ross does at 76, who indeed could ask for anything more? At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Flatiron district, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $25 cover, two-drink minimum. (Holden) SECRET MACHINES (Tomorrow) The slowly unfolding, keyboard-driven compositions of Secret Machines have a stark, minimalist side; a glimmer of country; some pulsating; and a streak of Pink Floyd grandeur that swells to fill the room. There's a haunted undercurrent amid the pomp. The band plays with the Bellmer Dolls and Dragons of Zynth as part of the High Line Festival. At 9 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com or highlinefestival.com; $26.50. (Pareles) * BEANIE SIGEL (Tuesday) Recently this gruff Philadelphia rapper has been in and out of jail, been shot in the arm and found himself caught in the middle of a big-league rap feud. But fans of Beanie Sigel, whose rhymes detail life on the lam and the sad minutiae of prison life (''You hearing grown men moan at night''), will mob this club show not only for the rare chance to see him perform -- you never know when he'll be back -- but also for a preview of his eagerly awaited new album, ''The Solution.'' At 8:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) STEELY DAN (Monday and Tuesday) In 2000 Steely Dan released its first new songs in 20 years on ''Two Against Nature,'' and its members, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, crammed them full of musical subterfuges. The band once hated touring but has become quite proficient at it, especially now that Mr. Becker has accepted his inevitable role as lead guitarist. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Pareles) * GWEN STEFANI, AKON, LADY SOVEREIGN (Tonight and Sunday) She may sing about morning sickness and motherhood on her latest album, ''The Sweet Escape'' (Interscope), but Gwen Stefani has not slowed down; for her latest tour expect a full-fledged pop circus, with sexed-up cheerleader routines and costumes garish enough to rival Madonna's. With Akon, the ubiquitous Senegalese-American crooner, whose amorous songs are explicit without seeming nasty. (Some disagree: Verizon withdrew its sponsorship for this tour because of Akon's onstage behavior at a recent club appearance.) Also on the bill is the spark plug of British rap, Lady Sovereign. Tonight at 8, PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 203-2500, artscenter.com; sold out.

(Sisario) ROD STEWART (Tomorrow) His four Great American Songbook albums may not represent the most distinguished readings of those songs -- ditto the Bob Seger and Creedence Clearwater Revival covers on his recent ''Still the Same Great Rock Classics of Our Time'' (J) -- but when Rod Stewart lets go of his smugness, that whiskey tenor of his can be a powerful interpretive instrument. Doesn't happen often, though. At 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (516) 794-9303, nassaucoliseum.com; $52 to $125. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. RASHIED ALI QUINTET (Tuesday) Rashied Ali has had a substantial career in the jazz avant-garde, beginning with his role in the late-period bands of John Coltrane.

(Chinen) DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this one, led by his former trombonist Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ, like the saxophonists James Moody and Jimmy Heath. The trumpeter Roy Hargrove is a fine choice to fill Gillespie's shoes. (Through May 27.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) * BRUCE HORNSBY, CHRISTIAN MCBRIDE, JACK DEJOHNETTE (Wednesday) An unlikely but not unpromising summit of Mr. Hornsby, whose identity as a singer-songwriter often overshadows his lithe abilities as a pianist; Mr. McBride, a jazz bassist who has also worked prominently in pop; and Mr. DeJohnette, a drummer whose elastic propulsion creates its own stylistic world. They are preparing for the release of an album together, and raising funds for an arts education initiative called JazzReach. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., B. B.

(Chinen) * HENRY THREADGILL'S ZOOID (Tonight through Sunday) The august composer and multireedist Henry Threadgill has always nursed a fascination with timbre. These days he indulges it best in this superb ensemble, which finds his flute and alto saxophone in a tangle with Liberty Ellman's acoustic guitar, Jose Davila's tuba and trombone, Dana Leong and Rubin Kodheli's cellos, and Elliot Humberto Kavee's drums. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $20; $10 for students. (Chinen) DAVID TORN (Tonight) Mr. Torn is a guitarist and producer whose new album, ''Prezens'' (ECM), suggests a texturally slippery approach to group improvisation. That has a lot to do with the saxophonist Tim Berne, the keyboardist Craig Taborn and the drummer Tom Rainey, who rejoin him here; but it's also an expression of his gift for organizing sound. At 9 and 10:30, Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, near Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762, tealoungeny.com; $5 donation. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'CASTOR ET POLLUX' (Tomorrow) Yves Abel conducts a broad repertory in big houses these days, but he began his operatic conducting career as a specialist in French opera, an interest he explored by founding L'Op\u00e9ra Fran\u00e7ais de New York. Mr. Abel's current offering is this Rameau opera of overlapping romantic triangles. At 8 p.m., French Institute/Alliance Fran\u00e7aise, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160, fiaf.org; $50; $40 for students and members. (Allan Kozinn) 'DON GIOVANNI' (Tonight and tomorrow night) The scrappy Chelsea Opera, founded three years ago, takes on this Mozart work, which, for all its familiarity, remains a formidable challenge. The production, staged by Lynne Hayden-Findlay and conducted by Carmine Aufiero, is double cast: Justin Ryan and Peter Hakjoon Kim alternate in the title role. Giving singers opportunities to perform is the mission of the company. Though a makeshift stage has to be set up in St. Peter's Church to present productions, there are benefits to experiencing opera in such an intimate space. At 7:30, 346 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, chelseaopera.org; $35 to $40 in advance, with $20 tickets for students and 65+; $45 and $50 at the door, and $25 for students and 65+. (Anthony Tommasini) 'ROMULUS' (Sunday and Monday) The Guggenheim's Works and Process series usually offers works in progress; this, however, is the world premiere, fully staged, of a new one-act comic opera by Louis Karchin. Based on a play by Dumas p\u00e8re with a ''Three Men and a Baby''-like plot (only two men in this case), the opera includes the fine baritone Thomas Meglioranza, known as a contemporary specialist, in its cast. Peter Flynn directs; Mr. Karchin will conduct. At 7:30 p.m., Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3587, worksandprocess.org; $15 to $24. (Anne Midgette) WALL TO WALL OPERA (Tomorrow) This year Symphony Space devotes its annual ''Wall to Wall'' marathon to all things operatic, from old (Monteverdi) to new (Derek Bermel), from students (of Mannes and Juilliard) to pros (from City Opera), from a master class (with Renata Scotto) to masterly scenes from Strauss, Verdi and Bizet. From 11 a.m. until midnight, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; free. (Midgette) Classical Music * BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday) Barber's Piano Sonata is one of his most remarkable works, but it rarely finds its way onto the concert stage. Olga Vinokur is including it in her recital in this floating concert hall tonight, along with Haydn's Sonata in E flat (Hob. XVI:49) and transcriptions of Bach (by Busoni), Kreisler (by Rachmaninoff) and Schubert and Verdi (by Liszt). Tomorrow at noon, Ms. Vinokur is joined by the violinist Mark Peskanov in an all-Schubert recital, and in the evening (with a repeat on Sunday) the Knights Chamber Orchestra takes over for a rich program of Elgar, Arvo P\u00e4rt, Haydn and Vivaldi. Paul Schoenfield's inventive Clarinet Trio is the centerpiece of the Wednesday program, which also includes Bruch's ''Kol Nidre'' and works by Beethoven and Piazzolla. The performers are Nuno Antunes, clarinetist; David Marks, violinist; Adrian Daurov, cellist; and Katya Mihailova, pianist. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at noon and 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35 tonight and Wednesday, $30 tomorrow at noon, $50 tomorrow evening and Sunday. (Kozinn) MAYA BEISER (Thursday) This superb new-music cellist offers a program of recent multimedia scores, including several in which video is an important expressive element. Included are works by Eve Beglarian, Joby Talbot and Michael Gordon. The program also includes a collaboration between Ms. Beiser and the violinist Mark O'Connor. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Kozinn) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) The Chamber Music Society closes its season with works by Dohnanyi, Dvorak and the society's composer for the season, Bright Sheng. Yefim Bronfman gives the premiere of Mr. Sheng's ''My Other Song'' for solo piano and then joins the violinist Cho-Liang Lin, the violist Paul Neubauer and the cellist David Finckel for Dvorak's Piano Quartet in E flat (Op. 87). The program also includes Dohnanyi's Serenade in C for string trio. Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Rose Theater, Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50. (Vivien Schweitzer) EMERSON STRING QUARTET YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERT (Wednesday and Thursday) The Emerson Quartet, currently celebrating its 30th-anniversary season, is leading an eight-concert Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall devoted to Beethoven. It is also passing on the fruits of its lengthy collaboration to young quartets in a training workshop. The emerging ensembles will then perform Beethoven quartets they have worked on with the Emerson at two concerts in Weill Recital Hall. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $15.

At 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 707-8787, freeforallattownhall.org; free tickets will be available at the box office at noon. (Bernard Holland) JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET WORKSHOP (Tuesday) After a week of intensive coaching with members of the Juilliard Quartet, eight student quartets will perform in two public concerts at the Juilliard School. The young ensembles will give workshop performances of two pieces with their mentors, then play their best work in concert. At 3:30 and 7:30 p.m., Paul Hall, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, at 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free. (Schweitzer) MET ORCHESTRA (Sunday) This performance by James Levine's elegant orchestra was meant to be a showcase for the French soprano Natalie Dessay. Illness has laid her low, however, and the mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung will step in. There are some usual suspects on the program but also music by Ambroise Thomas. At 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $50 to $160. (Holland) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Thursday) Lorin Maazel, the orchestra's music director, takes over for a program of Rimsky-Korsakov (the ''Russian Easter'' Overture) and Bartok (the Concerto for Orchestra). Julian Rachlin is the soloist in Saint-Sa\u00ebns's Third Violin Concerto. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $94. (Holland) * URSULA OPPENS (Sunday) Arium, an inviting new cafe and concert site in the Meatpacking district of Manhattan, has been attracting some excellent pianists for a series of recitals. This Sunday afternoon the brilliant and adventurous Ursula Oppens offers a typically challenging, and very intriguing, program, with four pieces by the composer Tobias Picker (best known for his opera ''An American Tragedy'') and works by Beethoven, Schubert and Ravel. At 5 p.m., 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; $50; $30 for members. (Tommasini) NEMANJA RADULOVIC (Tonight) A long-haired violin prodigy from the former Yugoslavia, Mr. Radulovic appears at Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall as part of the Rising Stars series, for which he was nominated by the Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in France, where he now lives. He performs a traditional virtuoso's program: Mozart, Beethoven, Tartini, Franck and Ravel. Susan Manoff is the accompanist. At 7:30, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28. (Midgette) * DANIEL BERNARD ROUMAIN (Wednesday) This composer melds classical forms and timbres with the sounds and structures of hip-hop, rock and other pop styles. With his band, the Mission, and DJ Spooky as a guest, Mr. Roumain will play works from his new recording, ''Etudes4Violin&Electronix'' (Thirsty Ear). At 7 p.m., the Cutting Room, 19 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-1900, thecuttingroomnyc.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Kozinn) * SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY (Tonight) Michael Tilson Thomas and the players of the San Francisco Symphony have been winning accolades and awards for their bracing and insightful performances of the Mahler symphonies. For the second of two concerts with the symphony at Carnegie Hall, Mr. Thomas performs a group of Mahler songs with a distinguished Mahler interpreter, the baritone Thomas Hampson. The concert ends with Strauss's walloping ''Also Sprach Zarathustra.'' Mr. Thomas, a superb Copland conductor, opens the program with that composer's audacious and unabashedly modern ''Short Symphony,'' composed in the early 1930s. At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $98. (Tommasini) JOHN SCOTT (Tomorrow) Mr. Scott, the organist and music director at St. Thomas Church, plays the second-to-last concert in his 10-part series exploring the organ works of Buxtehude, in honor of the 300th anniversary of that composer's death. Built in a style similar to that seen in northern Germany and the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries, St. Thomas's Taylor & Boody organ is ideal for this venture. At 4 p.m., Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org; free. (Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

(Tonight and Thursday night) The folks at BAAD! describe tonight's ''Hit the Dance Floor!'' as featuring ''sensual duos, moving Butoh and heart- stopping hip-hop that bubbles with the energy of the Bronx and the diversity of the city.''

Ayo Janeen Jackson's inventive ''Where Unicorns and Demons Play'' is one winner, as is Camille A. Brown's tumultuously funny ''Evolution of a Secured Feminine.'' Both are part of the first program (tomorrow night). The ''e-stablished'' choreographers are David Rousseve and Tanya Isaac, on the second program (tonight and Sunday afternoon). Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 3 p.m., Harlem Stage at the Gatehouse, Convent Avenue at 135th StreetHarlem, (212) 650-7100, harlemstage.org; $20.

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Roberta Smith) * International Center of Photography: 'Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Holland Cotter) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Cotter) * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'Apocalypse Then: Medieval Illuminations From the Morgan,' through June 17. The symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * Neue Galerie: 'Van Gogh and Expressionism,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious homage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) The Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Philosophy of Time Travel,' through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world's latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi's ''Endless Column'' as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody) WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: Matthew Brannon, 'Where Were We,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein's brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Taryn Simon,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) Galleries: Uptown CLAUDE MONET (1840-1926): A TRIBUTE TO DANIEL WILDENSTEIN AND KATIA GRANOFF This exhibition of nearly 60 paintings by one of the most beloved painters in the world feels a little like having dinner with a celebrity. The gallery setting eliminates the usual distance; the startling intimacy allows you to experience afresh the momentum and innovations of Monet's astounding trajectory in the span of three small galleries. Basically, it is a chance to encounter, up close and in detail, the evolving ways of seeing and painting that established the originality, historical importance and continuing irresistibility of Monet's art. It should not be missed. Wildenstein & Company, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through June 15. (Smith) Galleries: SoHo * 'Gego, Between Transparency and the Invisible' The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called ''drawings without paper'': semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they're out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego's art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * 'Rebel, Rebel: Remembering Karlheinz Weinberger (1921-2006)' The self-taught Swiss photographer Karlheinz Weinberger, who died last year at 81, began his career taking pictures for a gay club in Zurich, but found his true subject in rebellious, working-class teenagers who dressed to shock in the 1960s and '70s. The Weinberger pictures in this show are fairly tame, as if chosen to complement the cooled-out work of the three younger artists -- Ryan McGinley, Walter Pfeiffer and Collier Schorr -- who surround him. But at his best, he's in a class by himself. Anna Kustera, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, kusteratiltongallery.com, through next Friday. (Cotter) Last Chance * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE' Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound, is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Katrin Sigurdardottir: High Plane V' Cut into a space between two levels of P.S. 1 is the Icelandic artist Katrin Sigurdardottir's ''High Plane V,'' a miniature artificial landscape of glacial mountains arranged in a naturalistic, faux-snow-covered setting against a painted white background. Visitors climb ladders and peer into one of two holes in the ceiling to view the work. The installation works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their heads in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org.; closes on Monday. (Benjamin Genocchio) * JOHN ZURIER: PAINTINGS It may be a bit late in the game for sincere monochrome paintings, but this San Francisco artist, who made a wan impression at the 2002 Whitney Biennial and is now having his solo debut, often pulls it off. Mainly, he refuses to be programmatic. His colors range from black to bright. The proportions of his canvases are constantly shifting. And his brushwork is an active, varied ingredient, free of bombast. To some extent he reiterates the monochrome the way James McNeill Whistler foretold it, with a bit too much misty preciousness, perhaps, but with genuine feeling. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0441, www.peterblumgallery.com/soho.html; closes tomorrow.
