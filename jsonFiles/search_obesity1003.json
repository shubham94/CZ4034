The startling figure, based on preliminary data from private employers and the program covering Federal employees, is out of line with scant rate increases over the last four years. And it raises the question of whether managed care plans have returned to the days of double-digit rate increases, abandoning their promise to smother medical inflation. There are good reasons to believe the answer is no. The premium increases earlier in the decade were chronic, the symptom of a fee-for-service system lacking financial restraint. Next year's double-digit premium increases appear likely to be temporary. Health costs are rising, but not alarmingly so. It is too early to write off managed care as a fleeting has-been.", "snippet": "THE most worrisome economic tiding for the new year is that health care premiums for employer-based coverage will rise by 10 percent or more in 1999.
