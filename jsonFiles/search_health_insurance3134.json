JOHN D'ALLARA Rescuing and Calming John D'Allara, a member of the New York Police Department's emergency service office in Harlem, was a rescue specialist on the scene at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. During his 14 years on the job, he pried, cajoled or otherwise extracted a broad array of life forms from danger, dealing with a menagerie of exotic animals. Spider monkeys. Bats. Squirrels. One time, he saved an iguana. But he helped plenty of people, too. ''One time, we had a kid trapped in an elevator, with his head trapped between a beam and the elevator,'' said Sgt. Lee Hom, who worked with Officer D'Allara for five years in the late 1980's and early 90's. ''He kept the kid calm, and we got him out.''", "headline": {"main": "A Seeker of Bigger Challenges, a Baseball Lover and a Car Enthusiast", "kicker": "A NATION CHALLENGED: PORTRAITS OF GRIEF: THE VICTIMS"}, "abstract": "Portraits of Grief biographical sketches of victims of September 11 terrorist attacks against World Trade Center; photos (L)", "print_page": "15", "word_count": 3199, "_id": "4fd2195c8eb7c8105d79723f", "snippet": "Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.
