Now, however, the main question has become whether it is healthier to be a vegetarian than to be a meat eater. With more than 10 million Americans (most of them young) saying they are vegetarians and millions of others limiting their consumption of meat and poultry, those are important health questions for the people involved and the society at large. The answer to both questions, based on currently available evidence, seems to be yes. A properly planned vegetarian diet can provide all the essential nutrients, even for growing children (quasi vegetarians who eat fish are especially unlikely to suffer shortages of essential nutrients). And, on the whole, vegetarians are less likely to be afflicted with the chronic diseases that are leading killers and cripplers in societies where meat is the centerpiece of the diet. This is not to say that a meatless diet is a cure for ailments from arthritis to depression to vaginal infections, as some proponents of vegetarianism have claimed. Nor does scientific research substantiate certain other beliefs about vegetarianism, such as the contention that eating meat promotes an aggressive character while vegetarians are passive or nonaggressive.", "snippet": "HE central question about vegetarian diets used to be whether it was healthy to eliminate meat and other animal foods, which are rich sources of essential nutrients, especially complete protein, iron and vitamin B-12.
