Ms. Emin has made herself internationally known in art circles in recent years in shows like ''Sensation'' and, most famously, with pithy confessional installations entailing soiled underpants, cigarette butts, empty vodka bottles and used condoms. Her latest work, at London's Saatchi Gallery, includes a big photograph of herself splay-legged, giving birth to a wad of cash -- the currencies, you might note, hailing from the countries where she has had exhibitions.", "headline": {"main": "What's This About Cultural Pollution?"}, "abstract": "Michael Kimmelman dismisses notion that America is becoming culturally polluted but does believe popular culture is getting more and more juvenile; drawing; photos (L)", "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2644, "_id": "4fd21d4a8eb7c8105d79e183", "snippet": "WHILE Hollywood executives were professing before a Senate committee not long ago to be shocked, shocked, that somehow R-rated slasher movies like ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' were being test-marketed to 9-year-olds, the news arrived from...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/05/arts/what-s-this-about-cultural-pollution.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "CULTURE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Michael", "lastname": "KIMMELMAN"}], "original": "By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2000-11-05T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Arts"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "lead_paragraph": "On a steamy Wednesday in August, Pat Moynihan rode with his family up Pennsylvania Avenue, a street he helped to resurrect, to the White House, a building where he once worked, to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an award that 37 years ago he assisted in creating. Hillary Clinton, the Democrat who hopes to inherit his seat in the Senate, began the ceremony in the East Room. Bill Clinton, whose departure from office will conclude eight years of strife with Moynihan, presented the award. On most of the 15 recipients, the president bestowed kisses and bear-hugs. But as Moynihan bowed his head to receive his medal, Clinton simply clasped his hand and whispered something in his ear. If Moynihan looked a bit abstracted as Clinton fitted the ribbon around his neck, it might have been because the room was, for him, full of ghosts: the four presidents he served (Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford) and the four he mostly fought from the Senate (Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton). Half the other honorees were people the 73-year-old senator has been enmeshed with at one point or another in his career: Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund and for many years his nemesis on welfare policy; John Kenneth Galbraith, one of Moynihan's predecessors as ambassador to India, his colleague on the Harvard faculty and his neighbor in Cambridge; George McGovern, who led the Democrats in the era when Moynihan felt compelled to break with them; and the widow of Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, who was one of Moynihan's closest friends in the Senate. Another honoree, the Rev. Gardner Taylor of Brooklyn, approached Moynihan before the ceremony to apologize for his attack on Moynihan's 1965 report -- once infamous and now widely praised -- on the black family. At the reception afterward, Moynihan seemed to return to the present as he sipped a glass of white wine and regaled the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, and a White House speechwriter, Jeff Shesol, with the story of how the Presidential Medal came to be. John F. Kennedy, who wanted to create a system of civil honors akin to those bestowed in Britain, referred the project to his labor secretary, Arthur Goldberg. After Goldberg went to the Supreme Court, the task fell to Moynihan, who tried to pre-empt opposition to the award by pretending it had always existed. But only after Kennedy was assassinated did his idea come to fruition. Lyndon Johnson awarded the first medal posthumously to the late president along with the other recipients Kennedy had chosen (with less evident political purpose than the Clintons) -- among them, E.B. White, Edward Steichen and Edmund Wilson. At the ceremony, Jacqueline Kennedy sat behind a screen in the White House State Dining Room and wept.", "headline": {"main": "For The Sake Of Argument"}, "abstract": "Jacob Weisberg profile of Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring after serving in Kennedy and Nixon administrations and as senator from New York since 1981; photos (L)", "print_page": "48", "word_count": 7470, "_id": "4fd20bbe8eb7c8105d77a588", "snippet": "On a steamy Wednesday in August, Pat Moynihan rode with his family up Pennsylvania Avenue, a street he helped to resurrect, to the White House, a building where he once worked, to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an award that 37 years ago...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/05/magazine/for-the-sake-of-argument.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MOYNIHAN, DANIEL PATRICK"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "NIXON, RICHARD MILHOUS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KENNEDY, JOHN FITZGERALD"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CONGRESS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "SENATE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Jacob", "lastname": "Weisberg"}], "original": "By Jacob Weisberg"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2000-11-05T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Magazine; Washington"}], "meta": {"hits": 2, "offset": 0, "time": 23}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
