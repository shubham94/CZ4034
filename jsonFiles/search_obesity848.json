Never in the history of professional football have so many players been so gargantuan, so overstuffed, so much larger than seems healthy, for them or for those they crash into. Even after the Dallas Cowboys cut the league's largest player, a 410-pounder, this month, there are plenty of 330-to-375-pound behemoths left to intimidate the most lionhearted of smaller players. The surge in girth in recent decades has been startling. The number of players weighing 300 pounds or more jumped sixfold over the past dozen years, from 50 in 1990 to more than 300 at the start of this season, with offensive linemen leading the way. The Dallas Cowboys' first-team offensive line averages an incredible 335 pounds per man, while the Miami Dolphins lead the league in rushing behind a line averaging 312 pounds per man. The New England Patriots, last year's Super Bowl champs, weigh in at 311 pounds. But size is no guarantee of winning. Dallas, its gigantic blockers plagued by injuries, has a 1-2 record, while the Denver Broncos, averaging 289 pounds on the offensive line, are undefeated.", "snippet": "When couch potatoes click on their television sets today, sink back into the cushions and prepare to gulp down snack-food calories, they can take solace in noting that the nation's weight problem has spread to the National Football League as well....", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "WEBSTER, MIKE", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "WEIGHT", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "EDITORIALS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "OBESITY", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "FOOTBALL", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "12", "type_of_material": "Editorial", "word_count": 535, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
