Although the death rate in children with malaria, 1 or 2 percent, may seem low, the actual number of deaths worldwide is very high: 1.4 million to 2.4 million a year, according to the World Health Organization. Those figures represent 90 percent of all malaria deaths, and they occur in children under the age of 5, most of them in Africa.

Jesse Jackson, 54, ran for President in 1984 and again in 1988. Early in his career Mr. Jackson was an assistant to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A strong advocate of education and the war on drugs, Mr. Jackson in 1986 founded the National Rainbow Coalition, a social justice organization. In 1990, he was elected shadow senator from the District of Columbia, a position giving the city a nonvoting presence in the Senate. Joseph R. Biden Jr. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware was elected to the Senate in 1972 at age 29, becoming one of the youngest senators ever. He had begun his political career only two years earlier, as a County Councilman. Mr. Biden entered the 1988 Presidential race but withdrew amid accusations that he had plagiarized a speech and equivocated about his academic record. As head of the Judiciary Committee in 1994, he sponsored a $30 billion anti-crime package that provided money for 100,000 police officers and banned 19 assault weapons. He is to speak on crime. John Kerry Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts was elected to the Senate in 1984, two years after he won a race for lieutenant governor of the state. A former Navy gunboat officer decorated in the Vietnam War, he returned home a protester and was a founder of the Vietnam Veterans of America. Mr. Kerry, 52, continues to be an advocate for veterans and takes an active role as a member of the Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees. In the last year, he has fought to protect Medicare, expand health care for children not covered by Medicaid and increase the minimum wage. Mr. Kerry is to speak on education. John Lewis Congressman When John Lewis, 56, first won his seat in the House in 1986, the Georgia freshman had already earned the admiration of many of his colleagues for his role in the civil rights movement as a young man. Mr. Lewis spoke at the 1963 March on Washington as director of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and was known for his fearlessness in the face of arrests and beatings. Mr. Lewis joined the House leadership in 1991, when he was chosen chief deputy whip, and he is a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Lewis will speak about the importance of protecting Medicare from Republican budget cuts. Lynn Rivers Congresswoman Representative Lynn Rivers of Michigan was elected to the 104th Congress in 1994. Mrs. Rivers, 39, serves on the Committee on the Budget and on the Committee on Science. An avid environmentalist, Mrs. Rivers first became active in that cause when she served three terms as president of the Ann Arbor Board of Education from 1984 to 1992; during that time she began recycling programs for paper and lunch waste and helped put a pesticide policy into effect.
