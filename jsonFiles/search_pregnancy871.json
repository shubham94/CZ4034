To diminish wrinkles, some types of lasers, like Titan and Thermage, send energy deep into the dermis (the lower layers of skin) without damaging the epidermis (the upper layer). That energy creates heat and a slight injury, which sends the body into repair mode, encouraging existing collagen (a building block of skin) to contract and become tighter, and stimulating new collagen and elastin (another building block) to be produced. The result? Smoother, plumper, more youthful-looking skin. Other lasers, like Lyra, Affirm and V-Beam, have specific wavelengths that are attracted only to certain pigments, such as red or brown, and destroy anything within that color range, so they work well on blood vessels, spider veins, sunspots and hair. What a laser procedure is like: Most involve an application of topical anesthesia or a cooling gel, followed by a few passes of the device over the area to be treated. Patients usually experience slight warmth or a mild burning sensation, which dissipates quickly. Aftereffects can be similar to a sunburn -- including some redness, swelling or flaking for up to a few days. How to find the right person to perform the procedure: Since you do not need a license to operate a laser, it's best to look for a board-certified dermatologist (check the American Academy of Dermatology Web site at www.aad.org) who has lasers as a major part of his or her practice. Be sure to do your research: in the wrong hands, you could be burned or scarred. Adds Dennis Gross, M.D., a dermatologist and dermatological surgeon in New York (212-725-4555), ''A word-of-mouth recommendation never hurts.'' How to take care of post-laser skin: Use gentle products, don't scrub and slather on a nonirritating sunscreen -- like one with zinc oxide -- on a daily basis. Cost: It depends on the doctor, the size of the area to be treated and the strength of the laser.", "headline": {"main": "The Connoisseur; Beam Me Up"}, "abstract": "Roundup of laser treatment options for skin conditions, aging skin and scars; photos (M)", "print_page": "57", "word_count": 2451, "_id": "4fd28fdc8eb7c8105d866ec0", "snippet": "How lasers work: In dermatology-speak, the word ''laser'' is a catchall for devises that use intense beams of focused bright light, those that use intense pulsed light (producing short, quick flashes) and ones that employ radio frequency or...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E4DF153FF936A25757C0A9619C8B63", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "AGE, CHRONOLOGICAL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LASER (LIGHT AMPLIFICATION BY STIMULATED EMISSION OF RADIATION)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SKIN"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Jill", "rank": 1, "lastname": "Schuck"}], "original": "By Jill Schuck"}, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2007-04-15T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Style"}, {"type_of_material": "Letter", "blog": [], "news_desk": "The City Weekly Desk", "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: One reason for the drop in crime in the city that Franklin E.
