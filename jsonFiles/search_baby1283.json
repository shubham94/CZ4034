By Didi Moore ntil two years ago, Jonathan Frank, a self-possessed second grader from Albuquerque, N.M., asked his parents with some regularity for a baby brother or sister. His 35-year-old mother, Karen, fed up with the questions and fairly convinced there would be no more children, sat Jonathan down one day and said: ''Let me tell you what it would be like if we had a new baby. The baby would cry at night. It would keep you up. You'd have to look after it. And I wouldn't have as much time to play with you.'' ''Oh, yuk,'' announced Jonathan. ''I don't want another baby.'' And he never asked for one again. With that explanation, Jonathan Frank made peace with his lot as an only child. It has long been considered a disadvantage - even a misfortune - to grow up an only child. To this day, the stereotype persists that he or she is spoiled, lonely and aloof. Even the expression -only child - suggests that sympathy is in order. ''Onlies'' have trouble getting along with peers; they are forever getting sick; they grow up to be self-centered, unhappy adults. So pervasive is this attitude that in national surveys one of the leading reasons couples cite for having a second baby is to prevent the first from being an only child.", "headline": {"main": "THE ONLY-CHILD PHENOMENON"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "26", "word_count": 4270, "_id": "4fd11cb58eb7c8105d5d9b67", "snippet": "Didi Moore, a freelance writer living in New York, is the eldest of four children.
