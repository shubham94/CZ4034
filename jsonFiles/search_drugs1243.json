Should they drink to protect their hearts or not drink to reduce their risk of breast cancer? As evidence mounts for the protective effect of moderate drinking against heart disease in both men and women, it is also accumulating for the potential hazards of even one drink a day to the breasts. To decide how to reconcile these opposing effects, it helps to understand the nature of the evidence and the relative risks of the two diseases. The Heart More than half a dozen very large long-term studies have linked moderate alcohol consumption to a reduced risk of suffering a heart attack and dying of coronary heart disease. While most of the studies involved men or mostly men, a recent report from the continuing Nurses' Health Study of 89,000 middle-aged women at the Harvard School of Public Health found that women who typically consumed three to nine drinks a week were 40 percent less likely to develop heart disease than nondrinkers.", "headline": {"main": "Personal Health; Women and alcohol: heart benefit versus cancer risk."}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "13", "word_count": 1065, "_id": "4fd1bb348eb7c8105d6e6145", "snippet": "THE Janus faces of alcohol have emerged once more, this time throwing health-conscious women into what could be a life-and-death quandary.
