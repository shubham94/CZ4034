For example, I was of the eat-until-you-are-satisfied school of pregnancy weight gain. My doctor, of course, made remarks about how much I was gaining. After Phoebe was born, 20 years ago, everyone had an opinion about whether to breast-feed, how and how long. I breast-fed for two years. When I nursed at dinner parties or in semipublic places, there were opinions about that, too. Opinions about motherhood in our culture aren't just specific, they are also general.

There is evidence that 3,000 years ago Egyptians rubbed soothing ointment on pregnant bellies to relieve discomfort and prepare for childbirth. Our culture, it seemed to me, was lacking in prenatal grooming rituals. I was wrong, as it turned out, but that is how I came to take May around to some of the high priests of beauty and fitness in New York to help prepare her for the great event. The first was Susanna Romano, a partner in Salon A.K.S. on Madison Avenue. Susanna said pregnant clients often want to cut their hair very short, but she advises against it, as short hair can be more work than medium length, and she thinks women feel prettier with some locks to toss around.
