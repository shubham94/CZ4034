More than half of all Americans are overweight, and many turn to high-protein diets because they can produce a quick initial weigh loss. The heart association warned that the loss is only temporary. ''If short-term is all you get the benefit for, then is it worth doing?'' Dr. Eckel asked. The advisory also said that while these diets might not harm most healthy people for a short period, they could be troublesome long term.
