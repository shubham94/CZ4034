CATHERINE GORAYEB A Sense of Irreverence Getting on Catherine Gorayeb's wrong side was simply unwise. Why would you want to? Ms. Gorayeb, 41, known as Cathy, was wittier, more adventurous and better turned out -- hair blow-dried daily, khakis ironed -- than most. And her sense of revenge was as irreverent and exquisite as Ms. Gorayeb herself. One ex-boyfriend found his refrigerator unplugged. Another, returning from vacation, learned at the airport that his plane reservation had been canceled by his so-called secretary. Staying on Ms. Gorayeb's right side was infinitely more rewarding. When her older sister, Claire, had her cat euthanized, Ms. Gorayeb hopped a plane to comfort her. She advised a friend abandoned by a husband to get back in the saddle and promptly took her horseback riding -- although Ms. Gorayeb secretly felt skittish around horses. Life had finally found Ms. Gorayeb's right side. The right job, as a marketing director at Random Walk Computing (for whom she was attending a conference at the World Trade Center). The right home, in Battery Park City, a stroll to work. Recently, the right guy. And best, her adored toddler, Kate. ''My name is Kate and I just ate / And now I'm going to stay up late,'' Ms. Gorayeb, a single mother, would croon. Celebrating the confident, puckish spirit that she and her daughter shared, she continued, ''Being gorgeous is my fate / For I am Kate the Great!'' JOHN A. SCHARDT Working Just Like Dad Can character run in a family the way perfect pitch and broad shoulders sometimes can? Consider John A. Schardt. When he was a boy his father gave him a white painter's hat, a brush and a bucket filled with water. As his father painted their house, little John brushed water on the foundation, happy in the notion that he was helping. Little John became a firefighter with Engine Company 201 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. ''He wanted to be a fireman because he could get to help people,'' said his wife, Jeanette. ''It was just a need he had in him.'' In the Schardt family they say Firefighter Schardt, 34, had hands of gold, like his father, Robert. Together they ripped out an ugly metal railing in the new colonial-style house that he and his wife had bought on Staten Island and replaced it with one of solid oak. Firefighter Schardt liked having his first son, Robert, now 4, with him when he worked on a house. ''Robbie, bring your tools,'' he would say as he headed for a job. Now, whenever someone comes to work on the Schardts' house, Robbie whips out his little bucket of plastic tools and says, ''I'm going to work like my daddy.'' Jeanette Schardt said, ''The other day one of his teachers told me Robbie said he wants to be a fireman. ''I'm not too crazy about that, but I guess I've got years to dissuade him.'' ROBERT M. MURACH Taking On the Difficult In the eighth grade, Robert M. Murach calmly took over as man of the house for the year that his father, a career military officer, was in Vietnam. In school, when the rest of the class opted for French or Spanish to satisfy the language requirement, he learned Russian, just for the challenge. He worked as a parking valet to help put himself through Columbia College, took a job on Wall Street and then went to night school to earn an M.B.A. from Pace University. So it was no surprise to his family that he wound up playing a pivotal role at Cantor Fitzgerald, where he was a senior vice president in the treasury department. Keeping track of Cantor's worldwide financial transactions, which on some days approached the trillion-dollar mark, was his responsibility. ''He always went after the difficult things, was always looking for something over and beyond the norm,'' said his brother Richard. But Robert Murach, 45, was hardly all work and no play. A die-hard Jets fan, he rarely missed a tailgate party; an aficionado of fine Scotch and cigars, he attended tastings at Keen's Chop House in Manhattan with like-minded colleagues. In 2001, combining a reunion with an adventure, he rode the rapids in Idaho with teammates from his state championship-winning mile relay squad from Xaverian High School in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. He lived in Montclair, N.J., with his wife, Laurie, and their two daughters, Madison and Haley. STEVEN B. LILLIANTHAL More Than One Balloon There are fathers who buy balloons for their 4-year-old twins, and there are fathers who gallop back to the concession stand to buy replacements after one twin loses her grip on the gift and tearfully watches it sail into the sky, chased but not caught by Dad. Steven B. Lillianthal, whose daughter, Emma, was forever getting butterfingers and losing balloons while her twin, Gabriel, hung onto his, was the type of father who intuitively understood the importance of a balloon. He made sure Emma did not go home without a balloon, whether it was a special Elmo model from Sesame Place or merely a generic bubble from the child-friendly restaurant downtown. A broker at Cantor Fitzgerald, Mr. Lillianthal, 38, grew up in Howard Beach, Queens, and lived in Millburn, N.J., with his wife, Adina, the twins and a 3-month-old son, Samuel. He also opened the door to his widowed mother-in-law, Arleen Klein. She spent summers there and grew to think of her obliging son-in-law as a true son. ''He was the glue who held the family together, except that he couldn't actually use glue, because he wasn't handy,'' she said. ''He was always protective of everybody's feelings. He was the kind of guy who called his parents every day.'' Besides his family, he loved golf, the Jets and Bruce Springsteen, not necessarily in that order. If the rock star played a three-night stand, Mr. Lillianthal was there for the full run: to him, Springsteen concerts were like balloons. You wanted to hang onto them. And one was never enough. KEVIN PRIOR 'I'm Always Coming Home' Doreen Noone met plenty of eligible firefighters -- they frequented her father's bar in Bellmore, on Long Island -- but she always hesitated to get involved with one. The job just seemed too risky. Kevin Prior changed her mind. ''He was very determined,'' said Ms. Noone, Firefighter Prior's fianc\u00e9e. ''He thought he was invincible all the time. He said, 'Don't worry about me; I'm always coming home.' '' Firefighter Prior, 28, who worked at Squad 252 in Brooklyn, was always determined to be a firefighter, even during the two years he spent as a New York City police officer. He took the job only because he thought it would help him move up the firefighters' list, Ms. Noone said. He stayed busy at the volunteer fire department in Bellmore, where he lived. Firefighter Prior's cheerful hardheadedness surfaced again in 2001 atop a mountain in Ireland, the couple's ancestral home. They both wanted to take a rock from the peak back to New York, but each claimed to have found the perfect one. So they wound up taking both. When Firefighter Prior died in the World Trade Center, Ms. Noone was glad they had two rocks. She kept one and put the other in his coffin. A few months after Firefighter Prior's death, Ms. Noone visited a psychic who somehow divined that Ms. Noone had had Kevin's name tattooed on her back after he died. ''He said Kevin saw it, and he was honored by it,'' she said. CHERYL A. MONYAK A Magic Friend Cheryl A. Monyak was a ''magic person'' for the children of her close friend Martha Ambros. Before she was even an aunt, she offered to baby-sit overnight for Ms. Ambros's two children, then 4 and 2 1/2. ''My kids still talk about it,'' said Ms. Ambros, recalling how Ms. Monyak bought balloons and a cake and party decorations. ''My daughter would say, 'You should've seen Cheryl getting all those balloons in the car; she had a lot of trouble.' She never did anything halfway.'' Ms. Ambros and Ms. Monyak used to reserve Sunday afternoons for each other, when they lived in California or when they would talk long distance. Ms. Monyak, 43, a vice president at Marsh & McLennan, had recently moved from California to Connecticut, where she had grown up, to be closer to her family, and was living in Greenwich. At her memorial service, her friends served Champagne and dessert in honor of the woman who used to bring M & Ms to meetings to ease the tension, as Theresa Monyak, her sister-in-law, recalled. ''She touched so many people because she was a whirl, but when she was with you, she was with you,'' said Ms. Ambros, who knows that her children appreciated this. ''We were watching the fireworks on the Fourth of July, and my 7-year-old said to me, 'Gosh, Cheryl has a great view.' '' EDWARD RALL In the Rescue Squad Edward Rall's grandfather, a couple of his uncles and a couple of his cousins were firefighters, and Edward Rall always wanted to be one, too. ''It was worth it. He absolutely loved what he was doing,'' said his wife, Darlene. He was ''very, very proud'' of having belonged to Rescue 2 for six and a half years, she said. Firefighter Rall, 44, worked a second job to support his three sons, now 17, 15 and 13, until they were old enough to go to school, she said. ''When he wasn't working, most of the time we spent with the kids,'' she said. ''Two of my sons play baseball, and he spent a lot of time coaching them.'' And he frequently attended the marching band competitions of their other son. They did not travel much, aside from road trips to Amish country and Virginia, as summers were devoted to baseball. Mr. Rall installed a nice screen porch on the side of their house in Holbrook, on Long Island, and he liked camping with his cousins on the North Shore, where they would set up a 20-by-30-foot party tent. ''He was certainly in charge of first aid, I can tell you that,'' she said. She remembers him with a cigar and a Coors Light, sitting out on his porch, barbecuing with friends. ''It was a very simple life.'' STEVEN SCHLAG 'It's 88 and Sunny' Steven Schlag used to organize fathers-and-kids and just-the-men camping trips for his friends, with marinated steak, cabernets and cigars for the grown-ups and a backpack for the family dog, Jagger. ''He could lie down and look at the night sky and show them the stars and the planets,'' said his wife, Tomoko. ''He was just fascinated with birds. He knew birds and animal sounds. Birds would always come to him, for some reason.'' When a neighbor was in her third pregnancy and uncomfortably late, Mr. Schlag, 41, a partner with Cantor Fitzgerald who lived in Franklin Lakes, N.J., whipped up his chicken cacciatore, which had helped his wife go into labor. (It didn't do the trick for the neighbor.) And when a friend was scheduled for cancer surgery on Sept. 11, 2001, Mrs. Schlag recalled, her husband bought two copies of the bicyclist Lance Armstrong's autobiography and told his friend, ''We're both going to read this, and you're going to get through it.'' She related a trademark attitude of his, which she and their three children, ages 11, 8 and 6, are trying to live by now. ''Strangers would come up to him when he was skiing and ask, 'How are the conditions at the top?' '' she said. ''He'd always say, 'It's 88 and sunny.' That was his favorite saying.'' SANFORD STOLLER 'Laughter Came Easy' ''He had a very hearty laugh,'' Trudy Stoller said of her husband of 31 years, Sanford. ''Laughter came easy to him.'' Alan Levy, who had known Mr. Stoller since fourth or fifth grade in the Rockaways, where they had grown up, said he was known as Sandy the Friendly Mongoose for his speed in paddle ball. Their crowd of friends played pinball, Skee-Ball, handball, punch ball, stoop ball and paddle ball, with young Sanford Stoller playing almost every day, using ice picks to clear the courts in the winter if necessary. Mr. Levy remembers when they first started taking driving lessons: ''He comes running up, all excited, saying, 'I hit 40!' and I got scared. I said, 'Forty what, 40 people?' But no, it was 40 miles an hour.'' After falling out of touch for 15 years, the two men ran into each other at a restaurant and began having lunch every Tuesday. ''He loved his soda so well, whenever we went out we had to go to a place that had his refills,'' Mr. Levy said. ''It was fun times that we had. He'd talk about his vacations, I'd talk about my vacations, his ailments, my ailments, typical guy-type stuff.'' Mr. Stoller, 54, a systems analyst at Accenture, and his wife had two sons, Eric, 21, and Glen, 17, and lived in West Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. ''He liked to go in early,'' Eric Stoller said. ''He'd probably get there a little before 8. I think he liked to be the first one in the office.'' SIGRID WISWE High-Tech and Old World Sigrid Wiswe's actions spoke of the depth of her affections: a knitted baby dress, a cross-stitched valentine pillow, a fancy home-cooked meal, ''or the $30 panther at F. A. O. Schwarz she wasn't supposed to buy,'' recalled her only sibling, Dr. Birgit Wiswe. That panther was for Katja, Sigrid Wiswe's 9-year-old niece. Ms. Wiswe was a third of the way through a scarf for her best friend, Ann Wilson, on Sept. 11, 2001. When Sigrid was 14 and Birgit was 11, they immigrated with their mother from Germany. ''We were each other's little island, so to speak,'' said Dr. Wiswe, who talked to her sister, who lived in Chelsea, three hours a week on the phone. Sigrid Wiswe, 41, was both high-tech and Old World. Her job as a manager at American Express, where she handled the Marsh & McLennan account, let her fly all over the world, and she would make the same Christmas cookies her grandmothers had made. Ms. Wiswe's mother, Ute Mitchell, managed to finish the scarf for Ms. Wilson in time for Christmas, somehow finding the pattern and matching how her daughter knit. ''There were a great deal of tears at Christmas,'' Dr. Wiswe said. KEVIN COLBERT Never the Cheap Seats Everybody in West Hempstead, on Long Island, knew who Kevin Colbert was. He was the nice man who helped his mother move into a new house with her younger sons after a divorce, and then helped raise those sons, his half-brothers, who are teenagers now. And he was the nice man behind the bar at his grandfather's place, the Palm Cafe, where he was larger than life: more than six feet tall and 275 pounds. He loved the Mets, particularly Rey Ordonez, but he still went to Yankee Stadium because Alex and Matthew, his half-brothers, worshiped Derek Jeter. And he did not make them sit in the cheap seats. ''He would try to get the best seats that he could,'' said his mother, Susan Carroll, who recently celebrated what would have been his 26th birthday. An employee of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, he never left the room, got out of the car or hung up the telephone without uttering his trademark line, ''Take care, comb your hair.'' And he was never without his enthusiasm. A friend of his mother's wrote recently, ''Kevin laughed so hard, loved so passionately and lived like there was something wonderful to look forward to each day.'' BRIAN D. SWEENEY A Man Who Stood Out At a bar in Philadelphia, Brian D. Sweeney caught Julie Busa's eye. ''I always called that bar a suit bar, and he walked in with jeans and hiking boots,'' she said. ''He looked more like my kind of guy.'' They were married seven months later. Mr. Sweeney, 38, stood out in other ways, too. At 6-foot-3 and 230 pounds, he was a broad man who had attended Boston University on a football scholarship. After college, he joined the Navy, graduating as a lieutenant from the Aviation Officers Candidate School and becoming an F-14 fighter pilot in the Persian Gulf war. Mr. Sweeney taught at the elite Navy Fighter Weapons School. On Sept. 11, 2001, he was on board United Airlines Flight 175 for a business trip. Mr. Sweeney and his wife lived on Cape Cod in Barnstable, Mass., where they spent their time fixing up their home. She said: ''He was my plumber, my electrician, my seamstress. My everything, really.'' JEFF PALAZZO Meet the Disco King In the 1980's, Jeff Palazzo was a Brooklyn disco king who liked the cruising scene and obsessing over his Chevy Malibu. At a dance benefit at Bishop Ford High School in 1987, the disco king fell for a self-described ''rock head'' from Marine Park named Lisa Vissalo. They married three years later. The disco king tamed the rock head. He traded in his cruising cars for Bronco trucks outfitted with car seats for daughters Nicole, 5, and Samantha, 2. He bought a fixer-upper home in New Dorp, in Staten Island. He packed up his family on weekends off and took them camping and scuba diving. Jeff Palazzo, 33, joined the Fire Department in 1996. He spent eight years with the Coast Guard and matured into a disciplined student who was studying for the fire lieutenant and the Coast Guard chief exams. Sept. 15 was the Palazzos' wedding anniversary. ''I think, 'How can I have not seen or talked to him in a whole year and still be standing?' '' Mrs. Palazzo said recently. ''I'm glad we started young because if we'd waited we would have lost out on a lot of good years together.'' PETE NEGRON Consummate Team Player When Pete Negron signed his signature, he would end it with 20, the number of his favorite New York Yankees player, Bucky Dent. ''He loved the Yankees,'' said his wife, Leila. He even asked her to marry him in a Bronx baseball field, where they had met as teenagers. In many ways, the philosophy of baseball was the way he lived his life. He was the consummate team player. ''He used to have a motto,'' Mrs. Negron said. ''When someone would make excuses, he would tell them, 'Don't complain, Just do it!' '' He learned determination through his mother, Linda, who raised him and his sister, Betsy, by herself, often holding up to three jobs at a once, Mrs. Negron said. He was hired by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1994, and the job at the World Trade Center was a defining moment in his career. ''He was so excited,'' said Mrs. Negron, who lived with her husband in Bergenfield, N.J. ''He loved those buildings.'' Rising up the ranks, Pete Negron, at 34, was a project manager in the environmental field. EDWIN ZAMBRANA JR. Love and Basketball Edwin Zambrana Jr. almost died in a car accident when he was 13. And for the next few years, the fun-loving young man became a shy, sensitive young man with the scar on his face, his self-esteem all but drained. But Mr. Zambrana, known as Eddie, overcame his difficulties by doing his best to help others. First he took care of his mother, who has lupus. It was practically his full-time job. A few years ago, he started his own unofficial basketball clinic in his neighborhood in Staten Island. Basketball, said Edwin Zambrana Sr., was his son's true passion. He was scheduled to have a tryout with a professional team in Puerto Rico in March 2002. He taught children ages 6 to 18 everything from layups to fundamentals to defense. And what started as an informal session flowered into intense classes in which up to 100 children participated. Then, not long before Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Zambrana, 24, took a job as a maintenance worker at the World Trade Center, joining his father. Father got out; son did not. Next year, Mr. Zambrana hopes to start a Eddie Zambrana basketball clinic, complete with T-shirts, right in front of the Zambrana house. If anyone wants to look, Mr. Zambrana will also be glad to show his new tattoo on his left arm. It says, ''Eddie, Always Missing You. My Hero. 9-11-01.'' ANTHONY DESPERITO Dedication to a Hero A 2,000-pound boulder behind a high school soccer field on Long Island reads: In memory of a hero, a husband, a father, a coach, a board member and a friend. It was dedicated to Lt. Anthony Desperito, 43, of the New York Fire Department, who coached soccer at Bellport High School. Seniors who were on the soccer team receive scholarship awards in his name. Lieutenant Desperito, who lived in East Patchogue, N.Y., also coached the soccer team of his 11-year-old son, Anthony. He was equally as active in the lives of his other children, Nicole, 14, and David, 7. ''Do you know how to make Dad's Chicken McGuinness?'' his wife, Laura Desperito, said the children ask. The dish is named for McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where he used to be stationed. ''I tell them that he knew all the recipes by heart,'' Mrs. Desperito said. The couple would have celebrated their 20th anniversary on Sept. 25. ''He was such a romantic,'' Mrs. Desperito said. ''He proposed to me on Rockaway Beach, where we always used to take long walks on the jetties. He didn't let me open the box near the water because he was afraid it would fall in the water.'' During his final hours, Lieutenant Desperito escorted a woman to safety from the north tower of the World Trade Center, and then ran back inside to search for more. SAMUEL OITICE Roller Coaster Love Samuel Oitice and his wife, Jean, met on the Peekskill, N.Y., ambulance corps. ''He was the driver and I was the crew chief, and I said, 'That's how we're going to keep it,' '' she said. ''I'd tell everyone that story, but it's not funny anymore.'' Samuel Oitice, 45, was a New York City firefighter who lived in Peekskill. The couple had a son, John, 19, and a daughter, Jessica, 16. In the past year, Mrs. Oitice has had to take on her husband's love of roller coasters. ''The higher they were, the bigger the drop, the more he loved them,'' she said. She used to stay on the ground, but has since ridden Disney World's Tower of Terror with her daughter, who told her, ''Daddy would be proud.'' And he knew the risks of his job. ''He said to the kids at one point, when they finally realized what he did: 'I married your mom for a reason. I know if something happens to me she'll get you through this,' '' she said. ''It has just given me strength to know that he had so much faith in me to keep the family together.'' After his funeral, his best friend came into the firehouse, laughing, she said. Seems the fire truck carrying his body had stalled in the graveyard and couldn't be started. ''I said, 'He's playing with us.' He hated all the pomp and circumstance.
