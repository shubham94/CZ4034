These overproduced androgens masculinize the female fetus in utero, such that she is born with ambiguous genitalia, making sex assignment in the newborn difficult. There is now ample evidence that treatment of the fetus by administering medication to the mother from early in pregnancy to term can prevent the masculinization of the genitalia in the female fetus. Prenatal diagnosis (via DNA analysis) and treatment have proven so far to be effective. Such treatment prevents genital ambiguity and causes the affected female to be born with normal female genitalia, and thus no confusion of sex assignment.
