During a commercial break, so the story goes, King leaned over to ask his old friend, confidentially, how he was dealing with the operation's grimmest side effect, impotence. Dole cheerfully informed the talk-show host that there was a new drug, Viagra, and miraculously, it had cured the problem. King asked Dole if he would discuss it on the air, and Dole said sure, why not? The world was about to become a very different place. Viagra would cycle through the expected paces of pop-culture acceptance with stunning speed. Leno and Letterman got an entire summer's worth of monologues off the subject. For a while the papers regularly pumped out clowning (and possibly true) stories about the drug -- there was Frank Bernardo, 70, who left his wife, declaring, ''It's time for me to be a stud again''; there was also Gen.
