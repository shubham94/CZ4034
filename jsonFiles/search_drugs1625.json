But when President Reagan was sent home from the hospital last month the White House announced that he would almost certainly not be getting any adjuvant drug treatments to ward off a possible recurrence of his cancer of the colon. The announcement gave wide public recognition to a sobering medical fact: The drugs tested in adjuvant treatments over the past decade have had varying degrees of success and failure in preventing the recurrence of cancer in patients who, like Mr. Reagan, have no detectable signs of its remaining in their bodies after surgery or radiation have eliminated the primary tumor. Adjuvant chemotherapy has proved highly effective in treating certain rare childhood tumors, moderately effective in treating breast cancer, and variously effective against rectal cancer, bone cancer, soft tissue cancers of the arms or legs, one form of lung cancer, and, possibly, head and neck cancer. But the adjuvant drugs have thus far failed to demonstrate a clear effect in preventing the spread of cancers of the colon, stomach, kidney or pancreas, most lung cancers, or malignant melanoma, a skin cancer, according to a range of experts.", "headline": {"main": "SOME CHEMOTHERAPY FAILS AGAINST CANCER"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 2027, "_id": "4fd1521a8eb7c8105d634567", "snippet": "Adjuvant chemotherapy, the use of toxic drugs to wipe out microscopic cancer cells presumed to remain hidden in the body after visible tumors have been removed, was hailed as ''one of the major achievements of the past 10 years'' by scientists at the...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/06/science/some-chemotherapy-fails-against-cancer.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CANCER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHEMOTHERAPY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS AND DRUG TRADE"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By PHILIP M.
