Under the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Congress was supposed to pass a medical privacy law by August 1999. Because Congress failed to meet that deadline, the administration is required to develop regulations. The issuing of administrative rules, however, does not diminish the need for Congress to pass comprehensive legislation. Dramatic changes in the medical industry mean that the flow of medical information is no longer limited to private notes jotted into a patient's folder at the doctor's office. The rise of computerization and health care networks serving hundreds of thousands of patients have made it possible to compile detailed patient information in databanks that can be shared by doctors, insurers, researchers, employers, pharmacists and others. This offers useful ways to track medical outcomes, monitor patient care and assess physician competence. But it can also result in a loss of confidentiality, a prospect that is causing justified concern about an erosion of privacy between doctors and patients.", "headline": {"main": "Protecting Patient Privacy"}, "abstract": "Editorial lauds Clinton administration for taking important first step to protect medical privacy by proposing new Federal regulations; says issuing of adminstrative rules will not diminish need for Congress to pass comprehensive legislation but is good baseline on which to build stronger privacy rights for patients (M)", "print_page": "22", "word_count": 481, "_id": "4fd22d078eb7c8105d7b9ab4", "snippet": "With Congress deadlocked on how to protect medical privacy, the Clinton administration has taken an important but incomplete first step in addressing the problem by proposing new federal regulations.
