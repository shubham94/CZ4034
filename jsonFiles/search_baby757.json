She is talking about her adopted son, the boy whose troubles have brought her here to the Attachment Center at Evergreen, where she hopes he can be taught to love her.

When she and her husband brought him home from Romania in June 1991, the boy was 4 and his sister, whom they also adopted, was 8. Their mother was dead, the Romanian adoption broker had said, and their father was an alcoholic and nearly blind. When he wasn't forcing them to beg in the streets or looking for ways to fob them off on childless foreigners, he neglected them. ''We knew all that,'' the mother says, ''so don't think for a minute that we headed down this path naively.'' She was well into her 30's when she traveled to Bucharest, and though she had been unable to conceive children, she and her husband had been foster parents for ''difficult'' children from the States. They weren't wealthy people -- he drove a truck for a living and she kept house -- but they came from a small town in Ohio where they felt they could rely on their friends and neighbors and where they were deeply involved in their church.", "headline": {"main": "The Disconnected; Attachment Theory: The Ultimate Experiment"}, "abstract": "Margaret Talbot article on attachment theory as it is being studied in children adopted by Americans from the worst eastern European orphanages, who are disturbed, detached and unreachable owing to extreme trauma of maternal deprivation; says their condition may offer insight into how children are affected by more routine separations of their mothers, as in day care; there are more than 18,000 of these adoptees in United States, and the most traumatized among them--roughly 20 percent to 30 percent--are one of most scrutinized and therapeutically manipulated populations in annals of psychology; this is in part because adoptive parents have proven to be such cooperative subjects; photos (L)", "print_page": "24", "word_count": 8605, "_id": "4fd217c18eb7c8105d793b80", "snippet": "On a bright, cold day in February, at a clinic in the mountains outside Denver, a mother sits with her arms folded across her chest and a polite, bewildered smile on her face.
