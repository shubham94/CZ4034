Tens of thousands of mourners, fans, impersonators, icon-sellers, former Elvis entourage members and hangers-on are flooding into this oven-baked Egyptian-named Mississippi River metropolis, the place that midwifed the birth of the blues on Beale Street and bore witness to the death of Elvis on his Graceland toilet. For days, a Canterbury-like fusion of carnival and spiritual impulses has been building toward the convergence on the grave in a climactic ceremony referred to simply as \"Candlelight.\" It's the central ritual in Elvis Culture, a phenomenon that has lately transcended the familiar contours of a dead celebrity cult and has begun to assume the dimensions of a redemptive faith. It began, the veneration ritual, with small gatherings at the gates of Graceland in the first few years after Elvis's death on Aug. 16, 1977. A few hundred fans lighting candles on Death Night has mushroomed to tens of thousands now. Despite the oppressive August heat in Memphis, the death ceremony eventually dwarfed the January birthday remembrance on the Elvis liturgical calendar and began expanding from a single night to a full weeklong pilgrimage and pageant. The corporate headquarters of Elvis Presley Enterprises at Graceland (representing the Estate, which is owned by Elvis's daughter, Lisa Marie) prefers calling it Elvis Week to Death Week and schedules a busy round of upbeat celebratory concerts, dances and the like. But for the deadly serious mourners who make the pilgrimage here from all continents (and from all age brackets), the central focus is on loss, on hurt, on the moment of grieving communion at the grave.", "headline": {"main": "AMONG THE BELIEVERS"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "50", "word_count": 8228, "_id": "4fd1cf568eb7c8105d707ce1", "snippet": "IT'S DEATH WEEK HERE IN Memphis, the week leading up to the mass veneration of Elvis Presley's grave, and the signature sound in the ambient soundtrack is a song called \"Hurt.\" The city is swelling with pilgrims from all over the world.
