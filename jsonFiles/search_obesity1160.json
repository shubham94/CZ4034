The four new groups, proposed at a news conference here on Monday, are fruits; grains; vegetables; and legumes, which includes beans, peanut butter and soybeans. Meat and dairy products are options, and minor ones at that. \"The typical Western diet, high in animal fat and protein and lacking in fiber, is associated with increased risk of cancer, heart disease, obesity, diabetes and osteoporosis,\" said a report prepared by the group, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a Washington-based nonprofit organization active in health and research policy. Most health professionals would agree with the evaluation. What most would do about it, however, is quite different from what the committee is recommending.", "snippet": "A group of physicians is asking the Federal Department of Agriculture to abandon the traditional four food groups -- meat, fish and poultry; grains; dairy products; and fruits and vegetables -- and to substitute what many will consider a radical new...", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"value": "EATING WELL (TIMES COLUMN)", "name": "creative_works"}, {"value": "AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "PHYSICIANS COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE MEDICINE", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "DIET AND NUTRITION", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "FOOD", "name": "subject"}], "print_page": "1", "type_of_material": "News", "word_count": 1070, "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": []}]}, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
