September REUNION Friends graduate from high school in 1986: 20 years later, one has been murdered, presumably by someone in the clique. Through flashbacks, each episode illustrates a year in their lives, gradually uncovering the mystery. It's an interesting -- and risky -- structure. Fox, Thursdays at 9 p.m., began last week. (All times are Eastern.) UNFABULOUS and ZOEY 101 The pair of hit tween shows starring actresses with famous pedigrees -- Jamie Lynn Spears, sister of Britney, leads ''Zoey,'' and Emma Roberts, niece of Julia, is the star of ''Unfabulous'' -- are back for their second seasons. Nickelodeon, Sundays at 7:30 and 8 p.m. (Tonight) THE WAR AT HOME Frustrated parents, incorrigible kids, suburban living. This comedy joins Fox's Sunday lineup, and fits in much better with family sitcoms like ''The Simpsons'' and ''Family Guy'' than ''Arrested Development'' did in the same slot. Fox, Sundays at 8:30 p.m. (Tonight) GILMORE GIRLS Lorelai (Lauren Graham) asked Luke (Scott Patterson) to marry her at the very end of the season closer. But though her romantic life might be in good shape, she and her daughter, Rory (Alexis Bledel), aren't getting along, breaking the hearts of fans. Amy Sherman-Palladino, the show's executive producer, has said the mother-daughter rift will get worse before it gets better. WB, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 13) BONES In watching the F.B.I. and a team of forensic anthropologists put together a computerized hologram based on the remains of a murder victim, one might wonder whether law enforcement ever has the time or budget for this technological exactitude. But oddly, this series is based on the life of Kathy Reichs, an anthropologist and novelist, who writes autobiographical mysteries. Ms. Reichs's fictional alter ego, played by Emily Deschanel (''Boogeyman''), banters with her F.B.I. contact (David Boreanaz from ''Angel''). Fox, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 13) HOUSE The cranky genius/Vicodin addict (Hugh Laurie) begins a second season of curing obscure medical problems. Dr. House's ex-girlfriend, played by Sela Ward, will be back for at least seven more episodes. Will ''House'' continue its ratings successes without ''American Idol'' preceding it on the schedule? Fox, Tuesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 13) SUPERNATURAL Two brothers -- one reluctant (Jared Padalecki of ''Gilmore Girls''), one gung-ho (Jensen Ackles of ''Smallville'') -- go in search of their missing father. Along the way, they have to keep the family business running, and that business is hunting evil. This genuinely scary series -- with executive producers McG (''The O.C.'' and ''Charlie's Angels'') and Eric Kripke (''Boogeyman'') -- is looking to capitalize on the horror-movie trend. WB, Tuesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 13) THE DIARY OF ANGELINA JOLIE & DR. JEFFREY SACHS IN AFRICA Ms. Jolie accompanied Dr. Sachs, an adviser to the United Nations, to western Kenya. No, not to escape the paparazzi -- to illuminate the overwhelming problems many Africans are facing. MTV, Sept. 14 at 7 p.m. HEAD CASES Chris O'Donnell plays a corporate attorney who has a nervous breakdown from stress. After losing his job and his wife (Krista Allen, ''Unscripted''), he goes into business with another crazy lawyer: one who has ''explosive disorder'' (Adam Goldberg). Fox, Wednesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 14) THE INVESTIGATORS: DEATH OF A RISING STAR Mia Zapata, the lead singer of the Seattle band the Gits, was murdered in the summer of 1993, but the case wasn't solved until recently. This documentary follows the long inquiry. Court TV, Sept. 15 at 10 p.m. THRESHOLD When an alien spacecraft appears in the middle of the ocean, the government's team leader (Carla Gugino of the lauded but canceled ''Karen Sisco'') acts as you would want her to: unsurprised and ready to investigate. She and her team find that the unseen aliens seem to exert a murderously unpleasant influence over anyone they contact. CBS, Fridays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 16 is the two-hour series debut at 8 p.m.) TWINS A family -- half nerds (Sara Gilbert of ''Roseanne'' and Mark Linn-Baker of ''Perfect Strangers''), half empty-headed beauties (Melanie Griffith, along with Molly Stanton from ''Passions'') -- runs a lingerie business. The creators of ''Will & Grace,'' Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, have had little success with other shows, like ''Good Morning, Miami'' and ''The Stones.'' Perhaps they will fare better on WB, where the ratings bar is lower. WB, Fridays at 8:30 p.m. (Sept. 16) SURFACE Why does a science-fiction show about giant sea creatures seem so much more implausible and laughable than one about aliens? For whatever reason, it just does. With that as a given, the pilot of ''Surface'' successfully employs the ''Jaws'' method of hide-the-fish well, lessening its ridiculousness. A marine biologist (Lake Bell) leads an ensemble of characters who have found their lives changed by their close creature encounters. NBC, Mondays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 19) HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER A man tells his kids how he met their mother 25 years earlier, and the story unfolds in flashbacks. Josh Radnor, Jason Segel (''Freaks and Geeks''), Alyson Hannigan (''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'') and Neil Patrick Harris (''Doogie Howser, M.D.'') co-star in this comedy. CBS, Mondays at 8:30 p.m. (Sept. 19) A related article is on Page 90. KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL Another urban upscale show from the executive producer, Darren Star (''Sex and the City''). Bradley Cooper (''Alias'') plays the fictionalized version of Anthony Bourdain, the celebrity chef who wrote ''Kitchen Confidential.'' Here, Mr. Bourdain is renamed Jack and has fallen from grace in the New York restaurant world because of his drunken philandering. Then he gets a second chance at chic chefdom. Fox, Mondays at 8:30 p.m. (Sept. 19) JUST LEGAL An 18-year-old genius lawyer (Jay Baruchel of ''Million Dollar Baby'') can get a job only with a once-great defense attorney (Don Johnson) who has become a corrupt loser. From the Jerry Bruckheimer factory (the ''CSI'' shows, ''Cold Case,'' ''Without a Trace''), this procedural series has the light dramatic tone of ''The Practice'' and ''Boston Legal,'' probably because Jonathan Shapiro, one of its executive producers, worked on both of those shows. WB, Mondays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 19) OUT OF PRACTICE The adult children of recently divorced parents (Henry Winkler and Stockard Channing) try to deal with their strained family dynamic. The laughs on ''Frasier,'' also from the executive producers Joe Keenan and Christopher Lloyd, were never this forced. CBS, Mondays at 9:30 p.m. (Sept. 19) MY NAME IS EARL A luckless petty criminal (Jason Lee) loses a winning lottery ticket for $100,000 when he is hit by a car and the ticket blows away. NBC, Tuesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 20) A related article is on Page 90. NIP/TUCK When viewers last saw Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) at the end of Season 2, he was lying underneath ''the Carver,'' a serial mutilator whose crimes were being undone by Christian and Sean (Dylan Walsh), partners in plastic surgery. FX, Tuesdays at 10 p.m. (Sept. 20) THE APPRENTICE: MARTHA STEWART Will Ms. Stewart revive the ''Apprentice'' franchise or contribute to its demise? The arguments against this show's success range from Mark Burnett's recent losing streak as an executive producer (''Survivor,'' but also ''The Casino,'' ''Rock Star: INXS'' and ''The Contender'') to the reputation of Ms. Stewart herself as being difficult. On the other hand, perhaps Ms. Stewart will bring back viewers who had abandoned ''The Apprentice'' because they were suffering from Donald Trump-inspired ennui. NBC, Wednesdays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 21) E-RING A throbbing, militaristic Pentagon drama from Mr. Bruckheimer, the hit-maker. Benjamin Bratt (''Law & Order'') plays J.T., a guy new to the building who tends to act rashly and bravely, ignoring the careful planning of the higher-ups. Even more improbably, his boss (Dennis Hopper) supports this maverick behavior. NBC, Wednesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 21) LOST After a run of keeping its fans happy during the first season of this plane-crash mystery, many rabid ''Lost'' viewers were infuriated by the inconclusive two-hour finale. It's time for some answers about what's down that hatch. ABC, Wednesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 21) INVASION Hurricanes plus Florida plus aliens equals creepy. This show seems like the potential standout among the big three networks' science-fiction offerings. Shaun Cassidy, the teenage idol turned writer-producer, created this body-snatcher series. ABC, Wednesdays at 10 p.m. (Sept. 21) EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS This comedy is the season's most-anticipated new show. Based on Chris Rock's childhood in 1980's Brooklyn, he narrates this sweet, funny, nostalgic sitcom about a family in which he was the normal one. UPN, Thursdays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 22) CSI The Quentin Tarantino-directed finale episode of ''CSI's'' fifth season, in which Nick (George Eads) was buried alive, will be tough to top. But many millions of viewers will want to see them try. CBS, Thursdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 22) LOVE, INC. A woman makes her living as a matchmaker but is unlucky in love herself. Busy Phillips replaced the not-funny Shannen Doherty as the lead in this comedy. But Ms. Doherty was not its only problem: the whole show is. UPN, Thursdays at 9:30 (Sept. 22) CRIMINAL MINDS Mandy Patinkin plays an F.B.I. profiler haunted by a previous failure. Back from a medical leave, he joins a team led by Thomas Gibson (''Dharma & Greg'') to hunt for the serial killers who -- as anyone who watches television knows -- are around every corner looking to kidnap, torture and murder us. CBS, Wednesdays at 9 p.m. beginning Sept. 28 (series debut Sept. 22 at 10 p.m.) BIOGRAPHY: MARLON BRANDO Nearly 15 months after his death at the age of 80, Brando's life and career get the ''Biography'' treatment. The two-hour show will feature interviews with Robert Duvall and other former co-workers, as well as family members. A&E, Sept. 23 at 8 p.m. VIVA BASEBALL A new documentary looks at the legacy of Latin American players in Major League Baseball over the past 50 years, featuring interviews with Luis Tiant, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, Fernando Valenzuela and many others. Spike, Sept. 23 at 9 p.m. KILLER INSTINCT A San Francisco detective (Johnny Messner) who investigates deviant crimes -- television-speak for those resulting in dead, beautiful young women -- prefers to work alone after his partner-girlfriend was killed. But now he has a new partner (Marguerite Moreau of ''Life as We Know It''), whose motives might not be in his best interests. Fox, Fridays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 23) THREE WISHES Get out your handkerchiefs: Amy Grant, the Christian music icon, goes from town to town granting three wishes, meaning thrice the do-gooding of ABC's ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.'' NBC, Fridays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 23) INCONCEIVABLE If television reflects cultural trends, it was only a matter of time before a show was set in a fertility clinic. This series -- led by Jonathan Cake (''Empire'') and Ming-Na (''ER'') -- illustrates the dramatic scenarios of medically aided conception and its accompanying ethical dilemmas, before a soapy backdrop. Angie Harmon (''Law & Order'') was a late addition to the cast. NBC, Fridays at 10 p.m. (Sept. 23) GHOST WHISPERER Jennifer Love Hewitt sees dead people. Or at least her character, a newlywed, does: she helps ghosts resolve problems that have prevented them from moving to the great beyond. This series takes over the time slot of the canceled ''Joan of Arcadia,'' as part of CBS's quest for younger viewers, and while speaking to reporters last spring, Leslie Moonves, the network's chairman, predicted that ''ghosts skew younger than God.'' We will see. CBS, Fridays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 23) THE WEST WING Who will inherit the Jed Bartlet-Martin Sheen throne, Jimmy Smits's Democrat or Alan Alda's Republican? As with a real election, viewers won't know until November. NBC, Sundays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 25) CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM Embrace the dyspepsia -- Larry David is back for a 10-episode fifth season. HBO, Sundays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 25) EXTRAS Another HBO comedy about Hollywood that features cameo appearances by actors playing themselves. What sets this one apart from ''Curb,'' ''Unscripted,'' ''The Comeback'' and ''Entourage''? Ricky Gervais, the star and creator, with Stephen Merchant, of ''The Office.'' HBO, Sundays at 10:30 p.m. (Sept. 25) DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES In the season finale of this phenomenal success, Rex (Steven Culp) died, leaving Bree (Marcia Cross) a widow; Mike (James Denton) nearly murdered Paul (Mark Moses); Zach (Cody Kasch) lay in wait to kill Mike; and in the final moments of the episode, Mike came home. Onward to Season 2. ABC, Sundays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 25) GREY'S ANATOMY When the show left off, the audience and Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) had just found out that Patrick Dempsey's character, her dreamy boss and boyfriend, is married. Ruh roh. ABC, Sundays at 10 p.m. (Sept. 25) ALIAS Jennifer Garner's pregnancy has thrown a wrench into the ''Alias'' plot as it heads into its fifth season, but viewers can look back at how things were in the spy thriller's beginnings in daily reruns. With ''Alias'' on every day, will its doomsday prophecies be less confusing? TNT, weekdays at 6 p.m. (Sept. 26) New ''Alias'' episodes are on ABC, Thursdays at 8 p.m., beginning Sept. 29. NO DIRECTION HOME: BOB DYLAN As part of PBS's ''American Masters'' series, Martin Scorsese has directed a documentary examining Mr. Dylan's career from 1961 to 1966. Mr. Dylan granted an on-camera interview to Mr. Scorsese about that time, which is a rare event indeed. PBS, Sept. 26 and Sept. 27 at 9 p.m. VH1 HIP-HOP HONORS For the second year in a row, VH1 will celebrate the forebears of hip-hop. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Notorious B.I.G. and Big Daddy Kane are scheduled to be among the honorees. VH1, Sept. 26 at 9 p.m. SEX, LOVE & SECRETS The best chance for this trash -- a nighttime soap opera about a group of friends in Los Angeles, led by Denise Richards -- is that it reaches a transcendent so-bad-it's-good level. You've got to see it to believe it. Or not. UPN, Tuesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 27) COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF After the president of the United States dies, his vice president (Geena Davis) succeeds him, making her the first woman in the Oval Office.

But again, that no one is safe anywhere -- thus the title -- is one of the lessons television teaches us. CBS, Tuesdays at 10 p.m. (Oct. 4) FREDDIE Freddie Prinze Jr. plays a Chicago restaurant chef whose female relatives move into his apartment after his brother dies.

N, Fridays at 8:30 (Nov. 4) PROJECT RUNWAY The first installment of this fashion design contest was one of the surprise pleasures of the last television season, offering a great villain in the diabolical contestant Wendy Pepper.

''I didn't have my mom there when I was conceiving, so why should I have her when I'm delivering?'' she asked. Just a generation after fathers had to beg or even sue for the right to be present, the door to the delivery room has swung wide open.
