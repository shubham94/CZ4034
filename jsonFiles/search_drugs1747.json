In the latest of these studies, researchers at the Harvard Center for Population Studies have concluded that menstruation begins almost two years earlier now for women in the United States and Europe than it did a century ago. Although the majority of previous studies show a drop in the age of menarche, there has been considerable debate over the findings as a result of what critics regard as a lack of reliable data spanning a century or more. In the current survey, Dr. Grace E. Wyshak and Dr. Rose E. Frisch assert that while individual studies over the years may have been flawed, the long-term trend is clear from the bulk of the research. The researchers reviewed more than 200 reports on the age of menarche in Europe from 1795 to 1981. They concluded that the onset of menstruation among European women has been occurring two to three months earlier each decade over the last 150 years.", "headline": {"main": "Earlier Menstruation", "kicker": "SCIENCE WATCH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "2", "word_count": 1048, "_id": "4fd11ee78eb7c8105d5de2cf", "snippet": "For years, scientists have been debating whether menarche, the onset of menstruation, has been occurring at an earlier age.
