If this continued, she warned, the environment would become so damaged that the song of birds in springtime would be silenced forever. She also warned of serious risks of cancer and other threats to human health. Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since ''Silent Spring'' was published in 1962. It became one of the most influential books of this century, helping to touch off an environmental revolution and changing the way the nation and much of the world looks at pesticides and pollutants generally.", "headline": {"main": "'SILENT SPRING' LED TO SAFER PESTICIDES, BUT USE IS UP"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "14", "word_count": 1608, "_id": "4fd16d868eb7c8105d660160", "snippet": "At the beginning of her landmark book, ''The Silent Spring,'' Rachel Carson quoted these lines from John Keats:   The sedge is wither'd from the lake, And no birds sing.

The public had been largely unaware of such practices. But last month the President's Commission on Organized Crime recommended that most working Americans be tested for drug use. Some members of Congress, civil liberties groups and employee organizations, already on record in oppositon to random drug testing programs, saw the recommendation as a new cause for alarm. At the heart of the problem is the inability of law-enforcement officials to curb illegal drug use in the United States. Nearly a fourth of the population has tried marijuana, and 20 million people use it regularly. Between five million and six million people are regular cocaine users. A half-million others are addicted to heroin. Try as it might, the United States has simply been unable to stop or significantly hinder the traffic in drugs.", "headline": {"main": "SHOULD EMPLOYERS BE ABLE TO TEST FOR DRUG USE?", "kicker": "ISSUE AND DEBATE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "7", "word_count": 1535, "_id": "4fd1700b8eb7c8105d6628ec", "snippet": "Driven by growing illegal drug use among millions of Americans and the inability of law-enforcement officials to curb it, many employers over the last decade have quietly instituted a policy that they hope will keep drugs out of the workplace: the...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/17/us/issue-and-debate-should-employers-be-able-to-test-for-drug-use.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "ISSUE AND DEBATE (TIMES COLUMN)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LABOR"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUG ADDICTION AND ABUSE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TESTS AND TESTING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By KENNETH B.

After years of suffering in silence, millions of women now readily admit to experiencing premenstrual symptoms that in some cases seriously disrupt their lives. They and their families are relieved to know that the symptoms may be both biologically based and amenable to treatment. Dozens of clinics specializing in PMS have appeared throughout the country, some hospital-based but others independently operated. Women should explore these options with care. One PMS expert, Dr. Judith L. Vaitukaitis of Boston University's School of Medicine, has said that many clinics ''are being merchandised like many of the fast-food chains'' and ''frequently provide unproved or ineffective forms of therapy'' for women who are desperate enough to try anything. Although a score of remedies for PMS have been tested with varying degrees of success, no one method has thus far emerged as the ''treatment of choice.'' Nor have the underlying causes of the syndrome been clearly explained. There is even disagreement among physicians and psychologists as to how PMS should be defined.", "headline": {"main": "PERSONAL HEALTH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "10", "word_count": 1373, "_id": "4fd15a578eb7c8105d63fe67", "snippet": "IN recent years, premenstrual syndrome has achieved both medical respectability and popular notoriety.
