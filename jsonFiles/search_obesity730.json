The human life teeming through this sprawling portrait of Brazil's criminal class crowded within a notorious penitentiary exudes a throbbing flesh-and-blood intensity that's so compelling it's impossible to avert your eyes. Watching this messy epic is a little like being jammed into an un-air-conditioned subway car on a steamy summer night as it rattles through an urban wasteland: at any second, things could explode. And eventually they do. It is the 1980's, and the setting is S\u00e3o Paulo's real-life house of detention, which was torn down in 2002, a decade after a riot led to the massacre of 111 inmates by the police. The film is a splashy return to form by the celebrated director of ''Pixote'' and ''Kiss of the Spider Woman.'' In examining social ills, it interweaves multiple stories of the prisoners' lives as viewed by a doctor volunteering his services. Below its documentarylike sprawl, ''Carandiru'' is a hands-on movie passionately engaged in its characters' personal dramas. Just when it threatens to go soft, it erupts in what may be the most horrific prison riot ever filmed (Stephen Holden).", "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film.
