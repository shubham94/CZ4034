So great are the Sun-induced ozone variations in the stratosphere, according to scientists who analyzed the data, that they must be taken into account in assessing any effect of air pollution on the ozone layer. In recent years there has been concern that various pollutants, such as chlorofluorocarbons, might deplete the stratospheric ozone that shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet sunlight. Chlorofluorocarbons, widely marketed under the trade name Freon, serve as refrigerants and were one used extensively in spray cans before that use was curtailed in the United States.", "headline": {"main": "SUN'S ULTRAVIOLET RAYS INDUCE SHIFTS IN OZONE", "kicker": "SCIENCE WATCH"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "3", "word_count": 1008, "_id": "4fd147088eb7c8105d622bbb", "snippet": "A WEATHER satellite has obtained the strongest evidence yet to show that variations in the Sun's output of ultraviolet light have a direct and substantial effect on the Earth's protective ozone layer.

This fast-growing public acceptance of presumed links between diet and behavior was greeted with alarm last week by researchers who say that evidence for the effects of various foods on feelings and actions is hardly ready to be so broadly applied. ''Anecdotes about dietary manipulations that people accept as truth are becoming solidified as social policies,'' noted Dr. Richard Wurtman, a neuroendocrinologist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was one of the first to show that ordinary foods can affect the brain. He said he was distressed by the application of ''preliminary findings and suggestions before they are confirmed as fact.'' In California, for example, each of the 57 county juvenile justice systems has changed the way detained juveniles are fed. While the specifics vary from county to county, all seek to reduce consumption of sugars and additives. Dr. Stephen J. Schoenthaler, whose suggestive findings on diet and antisocial behavior have triggered these measures, said correctional and educational institutions in 44 states had asked his office for help in changing dietary practices.", "headline": {"main": "DIET THERAPY FOR BEHAVIOR IS CRITICIZED AS PREMATURE"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1617, "_id": "4fd13d7a8eb7c8105d614712", "snippet": "IN thousands of homes, schools and institutions    around the country, hyperactive children, prisoners and juvenile delinquents have been placed on   special diets that restrict sugars, additives, and in some cases milk in the belief that such...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/04/science/diet-therapy-for-behavior-is-criticized-as-premature.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "WURTMAN, RICHARD"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DIET AND NUTRITION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRISONS AND PRISONERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HYPERACTIVITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MENTAL HEALTH AND DISORDERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD ADDITIVES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Jane", "middlename": "E.", "lastname": "BRODY", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": ""}], "original": "By JANE E.
