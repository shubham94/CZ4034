Jonathan Bennett plays Bo Hazzard, Randy Wayne (above right, with Mr. Bennett and Ms. Scott) is his cousin Luke, and Christopher McDonald gets gussied up in white as Boss Hogg. Willie Nelson, who played Uncle Jesse in the 2005 Jessica Simpson-Johnny Knoxville big-screen version, reprises the role here. 8 P.M. (Fox) THE SIMPSONS -- Principal Skinner offers Lisa a chance to tutor Cletus Spuckler's hillbilly children.
