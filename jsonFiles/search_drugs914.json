The joint action by several different agencies halted 500 different experiments at V.A. hospitals and clinics in Los Angeles -- in the very city where the suicide of a patient at the beginning of the decade helped to trigger concerns about drug research. Antonio Lamadrid killed himself in 1991 by jumping off the roof of a building at the University of California at Los Angeles. He was a former student there, one of dozens of schizophrenic patients under study to see what the effect would be if their medications were withdrawn. That procedure and another, in which patients are given drugs specifically intended to make their symptoms worse so that doctors can study them as they occur, are two of the most controversial forms of drug research. Patient advocates charge that both have been used at the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Center, which is one of the largest research institutions in the United States, with a sorry record for the casual way it monitors mental patients under study.", "headline": {"main": "When Mental Patients Are at Risk"}, "abstract": "Editorial praises decision by Federal officials to shut down all animal and human experimentation at nation's largest Veterans Affairs medical center in Los Angeles; says move is welcome sign that government agencies may no longer be willing to tolerate potential abuse of mental patients in name of drug research (M)", "print_page": "24", "word_count": 392, "_id": "4fd224d38eb7c8105d7ab1cd", "snippet": "When Federal officials in Washington shut down all animal and human experimentation at the nation's largest Veterans Affairs medical center last week in Los Angeles, it was a welcome sign that government agencies may no longer be willing to tolerate...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/31/opinion/when-mental-patients-are-at-risk.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "ANIMALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MENTAL HEALTH AND DISORDERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TESTS AND TESTING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "VETERANS"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "1999-03-31T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Opinion"}], "meta": {"hits": 2, "offset": 0, "time": 371}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
