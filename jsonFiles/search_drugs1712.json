But a spate of recent scientific reports has fueled concern that low doses of nonionizing radiation can cause subtle biological effects in humans and animals that might, conceivably, cause health damage as well. The evidence is murky, contradictory and inconclusive. No one is suggesting that the nation is about to discover a new public health catastrophe of major proportions. Indeed, there is no conclusive evidence that exposures at current levels pose much danger at all to the general public. But some scientists believe that enough warning flags have been raised to justify a more vigorous research effort and judicious caution until the results are in. The issue has enormous political, social and economic implications, because life in a modern industrial society would grind to a halt if all sources of nonionizing radiation were shut down. Public-affairs groups fearful of potential health hazards are currently opposing a Con Edison substation in Manhattan, a proposed Navy transmitter in Wisconsin and upper Michigan, and various power lines, television transmitters, microwave towers, laser installations and satellite communication stations in scattered locations around the country.", "headline": {"main": "'SAFE' FORM OF RADIATION AROUSES NEW WORRY"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1675, "_id": "4fd146918eb7c8105d621c90", "snippet": "UNLIKE the dangerous ionizing radiation emitted by nuclear fission and X-rays, the nonionizing radiation that issues from radio transmitters, radar, electric power lines, microwave ovens and a vast array of modern devices has long been considered...", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/02/science/safe-form-of-radiation-arouses-new-worry.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "ACCIDENTS AND SAFETY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SURVEYS AND SERIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RADIATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CANCER"}], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1}], "original": "By PHILIP M.
