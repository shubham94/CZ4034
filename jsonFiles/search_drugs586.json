India is the leading supplier of low-cost generic AIDS medicine. The country's huge generic industry has been able to copy antiretrovirals and other medicines because India grants patents for the process of making drugs, rather than for the medicines themselves. But the Patents Bill that India is considering, at the behest of the World Trade Organization, would change that. Parliament must make sure that it protects India's ability to make these crucial drugs. While the W.T.O. requires its members to respect product patents, it allows them to put public health first. Unfortunately, the Patents Bill would fail to do this; some of its provisions would go far beyond what the trade organization requires. The bill bears the heavy footprint of multinational and Indian pharmaceutical companies that are eager to sell high-priced drugs to India's middle class, which is larger than the population of the United States.", "headline": {"main": "AIDS Drugs Threatened", "kicker": "Editorial"}, "abstract": "Editorial holds that India's Parliament is about to take up bill that could affect sick people world over; notes that India is leading supplier of low-cost generic AIDS medicine; says country's huge generic industry has been able to copy antiretrovirals and other medicines because India grants patents for process of making drugs, rather than for medicines themselves; says patents bill that India is considering, at behest of World Trade Organization, would change that; contends that Parliament must make sure that it protects India's ability to make these crucial drugs", "print_page": "12", "word_count": 411, "_id": "4fd25ae68eb7c8105d807843", "snippet": "India's parliament must preserve the country's ability to make the generic AIDS drugs that are crucial to sick people the world over.", "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/05/opinion/05sat3.html", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "INDIA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GENERIC AND BRAND NAME PRODUCTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LEGISLATURES AND PARLIAMENTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAW AND LEGISLATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INVENTIONS AND PATENTS"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "pub_date": "2005-03-05T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Health; Opinion"}, {"type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "news_desk": "Foreign Desk", "lead_paragraph": "Twenty years after a federal law took effect authorizing the United States to penalize countries that do not control illicit narcotics production, the same countries, by and large, are producing large quantities of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and other drugs, according to the State Department's annual drug-trafficking report, published Friday.
