She would stand there on the ledge for as long as she could, gazing out at the trees and skyscrapers in the distance, until her mother pulled her back inside. Years later, Diane would say: ''I wanted to see if I could do it.''

The study, published in the official journal of the American Psychiatric Association, differs from others that have examined such adult-operated sex rings in that it focuses on the children's point of view and thus provides some answers to explain why children comply with the rules of a sex ring and remain silent about their participation. It shows that the adults who head the rings play on the normal interests of young children who are often in a period of their lives in which sexual experimentation is part of their psychological development. The adults lead them into joining what is in effect a secret society, frequently complete with ritual, to which they become tied by bonds of threats and fear on the one hand, and enticements such as drugs, alcohol and money on the other. Entrance into a sex ring, according to the research, involves the children in an elaborate indoctrination into the mores of the secret society. The children are taught to see the ring's activities as ''normal.'' The children rarely tell their parents or others of their participation, partly out of fear and partly because they learn to approve of a group that serves some of their needs for attention and belonging, the researchers said.", "headline": {"main": "COMPLEX COERCION BINDS SEX RINGS USING CHILDREN"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "1", "word_count": 1416, "_id": "4fd137058eb7c8105d6091ee", "snippet": "IN a major child abuse study, social scientists have shed new    light on the ways children are lured into sex rings, why they   stay and the protective steps parents can take.
