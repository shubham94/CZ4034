It's fair to say that the Korean War does not occupy a pivotal place in the collective American memory, certainly not compared with the sweep of World War II or the national preoccupation with the war in Vietnam. But it was a grim and unrelenting contest, twice almost lost, once almost won before it ended in a negotiated stalemate whose on-the-ground results endure today. Of course those who fought in Korea, like James Brady, author of ''The Marines of Autumn,'' do not share the national amnesia. Mr. Brady's novel about the war is almost brought down by the weight of stock war-novel devices. Even so, it transforms his bitter memory of the conflict into a gritty reconstruction of one of the war's most harrowing moments. That was the Chinese attack on American Marine and Army divisions that were proceeding foolishly past the earlier Korean line of demarcation at the 38th parallel all the way to the border with China. Again, it is probably safe to say that the site of the Chinese attack, which began around the Chosin Reservoir in the rugged, snowy Taibaik Mountains, is pretty much unknown to most Americans. Mr. Brady brings the battle there vividly to life, and death, in a novel that is more like a fictionalized documentary than a full-fledged work of the imagination.", "headline": {"main": "Marines in a Grim and Forgotten War", "kicker": "BOOKS OF THE TIMES"}, "abstract": "Richard Bernstein reviews book The Marines of Autumn by James Brady; photo (M)", "print_page": "7", "word_count": 973, "_id": "4fd23d538eb7c8105d7d36f3", "snippet": "THE MARINES OF AUTUMN  By James Brady  Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press. 274 pages. $24.95.
