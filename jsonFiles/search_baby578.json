The young British curator has woven a rich tapestry of a show from a theme that promises little more than wan provocation. Entitled ''Bravehearts: Men in Skirts,'' the exhibition is this season's offering at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, where Mr. Bolton is associate curator. You may go for the legs. You'll stay for the plaids. A vastly enlarged version of a show presented in 2002 at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, ''Bravehearts'' will undo the considerable damage Prince Charles has inflicted on the cause of kilts. Of the 120 fiberglass mannequins on display, not one has knobby knees. I checked.

The apartment has four large rooms with soft, creaky, dun-hued wooden floors and French windows with disintegrating wood frames and missing panes that let the rain, insects and even birds in. It is furnished with just a bed, bookshelves and two adjoining wooden tables where I work. Here I find concentration and long writing days as I do nowhere else, though that placid routine was turned upside down this summer when Mauricio Montiel rented the apartment next door and it became ''Montiel's Cave,'' where a group of youngish Mexico City writers and journalists gathered regularly at night to talk, over tequila, about books and movies, sometimes until nearly dawn or later. I would drop in to say hello and then find it impossible to leave. Montiel, a 35-year-old fiction writer and editor with several books published, was the cultural-page editor of Cambio, a Mexican weekly magazine informally directed by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez -- Mexico City has been his primary residence since the 60's -- until its owner unexpectedly shut it down last year. It's the sister publication of the original Cambio published in Bogot\u00e1, in Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's native Colombia, the one he owns. But now, Montiel told me one day, the magazine had a new owner, and Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez had phoned with the good news that he could have his old job back. Except Montiel was going to say no. He, along with a number of his friends, had recently committed to a new magazine that another friend was starting. He was excited about it, but felt guilty about turning down Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. He, like some of those same friends, owed their starts in journalism to Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's Mexican Cambio. Montiel told me that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez often spent hours in the magazine's offices huddled with young journalists, discussing projects and correcting and editing their work. When he described Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's brainstorming at editorial meetings, he made him sound more like some excited youth at his first editorial job than a Nobel Prize-winning novelist, now 75, possibly the most famous and generally beloved literary writer on earth.", "headline": {"main": "In The Shadow Of The Patriarch"}, "abstract": "Francisco Goldman ar\u00fc", "print_page": "38", "word_count": 5210, "_id": "4fd277698eb7c8105d838c5b", "snippet": "My get-away-from-New-York place, my hole-up-and-write place, is an apartment I've kept for the last seven years in Mexico City, in a rundown but sturdy two-story building on a tree-shaded street near a park.
