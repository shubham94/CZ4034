Jarrell was born 31 years ago with cerebral palsy, one of its cruel adjuncts being an esophagus that ended abruptly in a pouch, unconnected to her stomach. Five surgeries to fix this anomaly had riddled her frail chest with scar tissue, and over the past four years she had lost the ability to ingest and keep down food. Now for 12 hours each day, a ghastly viscous liquid seeped down a feeding tube imbedded in her abdomen to sustain her 72-pound body. Her daily list of medications, a pharmacological cornucopia addressing everything from pain to nausea to depression, filled a double-spaced sheet of paper. Late last year she tried to commit suicide, and words from her diary have continued to send up a cry to heaven for deliverance. In the thinly disguised patois of the very sick that most doctors have heard -- \"I am trapped inside this body; I want to be out\" -- she has cloaked her request that Gomez help her to die.", "headline": {"main": "The Next Pro-Lifers"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "22", "word_count": 7246, "_id": "5050e7b01c22dfde670c7d9c", "snippet": "LISA JARRELL WAS SITTING ON HER CRISPLY MADE BED not long ago at the University of Virginia's hospital in Charlottesville, her tiny legs saucily crossed, daring Dr. Carlos Gomez once again to keep her alive.
