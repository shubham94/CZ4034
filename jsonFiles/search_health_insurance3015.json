Fuzeon, which must be injected twice a day, is active against H.I.V. strains that have become resistant to current therapies. The drug has been approved in the United States and Switzerland. With European approval, Fuzeon is expected to bring peak sales of 1 billion Swiss francs ($777 million) a year for Roche. In February, Roche took the unusual step of announcing in advance the drug's price of 52 euros ($61) a day to warn health care providers, insurance companies and governments that will pay for the medicine.
