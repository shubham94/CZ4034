But at least in some forms and amounts, niacin has also caused numerous and occasionally severe cases of nonviral hepatitis. Niacin as a Vitamin Once known by the nondescript name of vitamin B-3, niacin is called a \"conditional\" vitamin; that is, the amount needed in a diet depends on how much niacin the body makes. A good deal of the niacin needed is manufactured in the body from the amino acid tryptophan, as long as other amino acids and B vitamins are present. Tryptophan, a component of protein, is especially plentiful in milk and eggs. Niacin is found in a wide variety of foods, like meats (especially liver), poultry, fish (especially tuna and salmon), whole grains, wheat germ, dairy products, eggs, nuts, dried beans and peas. It is one of the vitamins put back when refined flour is enriched, so it is also in all enriched breads, cereals and pasta.", "headline": {"main": "Personal Health"}, "abstract": null, "print_page": "11", "word_count": 1113, "_id": "4fd1c9548eb7c8105d6fc890", "snippet": "Niacin may be on the verge of joining vitamins C, B-6 and E, beta-carotene and calcium as a widely hailed micronutrient miracle.
