Even the American Medical Association and the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council, which have generally taken a conservative line on nutrition counseling, have recommended that sodium intake be restricted to 1,100 to 3,300 milligrams a day (the equivalent of half a teaspoon to one and a half teaspoons of salt), less than half of what Americans consume on average. Millions apparently listened and the food-processing industry got the message. Supermarkets as well as health-food stores now stock many items with reduced salt or no added salt. Dozens of cookbooks and buying guides have been published for the low-salt consumer. Salt-free seasoning mixes have claimed a place among the monosodium glutamates and seasoned salts. And many restaurants have cut back on salt in the kitchen.", "snippet": "IN recent years Americans have    been deluged with advice to cut   down on salt and other sources   of sodium to achieve and maintain normal blood pressure.
