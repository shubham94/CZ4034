It was during this unsettling time, which began shortly before I turned 30, that I became seriously interested in the workings of the human brain. Is the brain a computer? Is the self a fictional construction of the mind? I remember very little of what I read. What I do remember is lying in bed late at night, smoking cigarettes and reading abstruse arguments from university presses that I marked up in red and blue ink like a student frantically cramming for final exams. The air in these rooms was artificial and cold. Along with scientific and philosophical treatises, I packed flannel shirts and heavy sweaters in solid colors. When I was finished reading, I called down to the front desk and requested spare blankets, which I piled on my bed for extra warmth. The sense of absence and weightlessness that I experienced during this time was not entirely unfamiliar. I experienced the same feelings as a child, after my family moved from Brooklyn to New Jersey, where my parents wrestled with the pressures of four children, two careers and their marriage, and where I carried a small transistor radio with me every day on the bus to school. The radio, a gift from my grandfather, was made of red plastic and received both AM and FM stations. I kept it with me all morning. By early afternoon I would begin to feel anxious, until I would finally sneak off to the first-floor boys' bathroom and tune in to 1010 WINS. ''You give us 22 minutes,'' the announcer reassured me, ''we'll give you the world.'' The Yankees won and the Mets lost. Water-main breaks in lower Manhattan were causing 15-minute delays outside the Holland Tunnel. I returned to class feeling calmer, if also slightly dazed. I could go on like this for days, without recognizing that the thoughts I was thinking were my thoughts, or that my feelings were my own. Eating a chocolate ice-cream cone after school, I would feel the cold of the ice cream on my tongue, and then the sun on my arm would feel warm and nice. I was 11 years old. The pleasure of these moments was always mixed with the feeling that a ghost was leaving my body.", "headline": {"main": "In the Age Of Radical Selfishness"}, "abstract": "David Samuels article on his own life, traced in great detail, and reflects on being in his 30's, overpaid and 'totally disconnected' in age of selfishness; photos (special issue, The MeMillennium) (M)", "print_page": "120", "word_count": 5693, "_id": "4fd215d08eb7c8105d78fa73", "snippet": "What little I know about the self, or at least my self, comes from a year in my life that I spent living in air-conditioned hotel rooms while reporting on various subjects of interest to readers of glossy magazines.
