Heclaims that we do not have a ''health exception'' to the murder laws. Yes, we do; it is called self-defense. Arlene Kalley Troy, Mich. To the Editor: As a hard-line abortion rights supporter, I want to clear up a confusion in Rauch's mind between private moral considerations and public law. Abortion rights supporters have never said that a 10-day-old embryo is morally comparable to an appendix, or that pregnancy is comparable to appendicitis.I have argued that the decision to get an abortion should be a private decision by the pregnant woman -- no more regulated by the state than the decision to get an appendectomy. Pregnancy can pose moral, social, economic, emotional or medical problems for a woman that only an abortion can solve. Inserting the government into those considerations is what we abortion supporters want to avoid. If a woman becomes attached to a pregnancy and toher childwhen it is an embryo -- as your reviewer's friend did -- then of course she should carry thepregnancy to term and have the baby. We pro-choice peoplebelieve that the creation of human lifeshould always involve the willing cooperation of the woman in whose body it is going to happen.
