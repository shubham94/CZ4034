Should you replace them with chicken (without the fatty skin), fish, beans, polyunsaturated vegetable oils and margarine? Two years ago the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences challenged the long-standing recommendation of experts on heart disease that Americans eat less saturated fat and cholesterol to help prevent heart attacks caused by fat-clogged arteries. The board said that for Americans without an apparent cholesterol problem such a change was not justified because its role in reducing the risk of premature death from heart disease had not been established. However, in a statement published this week the nutrition committee of the American Heart Association has made a strong case that everyone adopt a more prudent diet, one lower in fat - especially saturated fat - and lower in cholesterol. The change should not only help those known to face high risk of developing heart disease but may also reduce the risk of artery-clogging disease among those who are not obviously threatened, the statement said.", "snippet": "SHOULD you eat less red meat, fewer eggs and less butter, hard cheese and other foods rich in saturated fats?
