But while some iron in the diet is critical for health and life itself, the overconsumption or overabsorption of this well-known mineral is now under intense scrutiny as a possible cause or contributor to killer ailments like heart disease and cancer as well as serious infections. The story of iron is a classic illustration of ''Just because a little is good does not mean more is better.'' Iron is essential to the formation of the oxygen-carrying pigments: hemoglobin in the blood and myoglobin in the muscles. But people should not take iron supplements or stuff themselves with iron-rich foods unless medical tests have demonstrated an iron deficiency, those who study iron overload warn. Some researchers are also concerned about the widespread use of vitamin C supplements, which can enhance the absorption of dietary iron when both are present in the gut at the same time. And questions have been raised about the wisdom of fortifying cereals and bread with iron in a country like the United States where a lot of iron-rich meat is consumed by most people.", "snippet": "GENERATIONS of Americans have been exhorted to eat spinach or liver for the iron that supposedly made Popeye's muscles bulge or to take iron-rich tonics like Geritol to revive their ''tired blood.''
